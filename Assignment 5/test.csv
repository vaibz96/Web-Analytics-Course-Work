2,"This is a little longer and more detailed than the first two books in the series. However, I have enjoyed each new aspect of the exciting fantasy universe."
1,Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
2,"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the ""gods"". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."
2,"This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out."
1,"The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. The product description is vague if not poor.The lights received are much smaller than in the photo (an inch in diameter). They are useless as illumination. I live in a high-sun area and have placed the charger in a position where it gets sun from dawn to dusk. The cord from the charger and the lights is long, which allows you to place the charger on the roof. In the end they are not worth the price."
1,"I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."
2,"I'm not much of a ""hard rock"" fan. I enjoy it from time to time, but I mainly listen to Radiohead, older hip-hop, etc. But this album got me hooked.One day, many years after the release of Toxicity, I decided to check it out. Right after the first track, ""Prison Song"", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was. Serj Tankian's interesting [but awesome] vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen. Check it out.-Jeff"
1,This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it.
2,"Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
1,"I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
1,"With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Black Album"" or Cigar's ""Speed is Relative"" or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock."
2,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."
2,"Clay Aiken's voice shines on this CD!!!! I bought this and well, I have bought one for my mom for her birthday. She has not been able to put it down!! She has listened to it over and over. Thank you Clay for a wonderful album and I can't wait till the next one!"
2,This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
2,"This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way"" also loved ""Touch"" (sounds like Marc Antony),and ""Perfect Day"" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked ""When You say You Loved Me"", very catchy."
2,"This book is a great introduction to a fantastic author that is often overlooked by American readers. ""Zorba"" is fascinating, deep, and hilarious, all at once, and it's short and playful enough such that it won't turn off more casual readers. I recommend this title as a starting point for people who want to read Nikos Kazantzakis for his philosophical insights or for his moving stories."
1,"A truly lousy record. ""wiretap scars"" were in many ways briliant but something went wrong with ""porcelain"". The album give no memorable riffs or chorus what so ever. Each song sound alike and after a while you are really bored. A truly lousy record"
1,This is a complete waste of money for any real Stooges fan. You do get three DVDs. One is cartoon stooges. One is Laurel and Hardy. Only one is 3 Stooges -1 Curly episode and 2 Shemp episodes. My husband is a huge Stooges fan and couldn't watch anything except the Curly episode. I don't feel it was properly advertised on the box.
2,"Equip yourself with this handbook of New Age facts, doctrines, comparisons, and rebuttals. This manual will help you educate the precious souls that are being blinded by the dangerous New Age movement. Learn the difference between the Jesus they preach, and the Jesus we know."
2,"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."
1,"Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her."
1,"Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums. But haven't you all noticed you can play Wonderwall and Live Forever directly over all of these tracks? I give'em 2 for being consistent."
2,"This book is a great resource for planning an Alaskan adventure. Area by area recommendations and descriptions are given to help the reader determine how best to meet his/her vacation goals.Especially helpful are the web addresses for individual services and locations, as well as the recommendations for the slightly-lesser known and (in the author's opinion) less crowded activities and the corresponding suggestions for how to beat crowds and how to plan ahead to have the experience you want.The general over-view information of each area also helps give the reader a good impression of the area and what the overall experience of the area would be like.A very thorough book."
1,"I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN. My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity. The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss. I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best. Not the case, buy Compaq or 3com."
2,Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size.
1,The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
1,"I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, ""Look how cute and adorable I am."" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."
2,"I have three children in diapers. My oldest is 4 years old and is autistic. We have not been able to potty train him yet.We tried several brands only to find out that Pampers Baby Dry was always the one we went back to. No question! No leaks! But the cost of our diapers just adds up. Amazon has the absolute cheapest price I have found - in stores or on-line. And free shipping, and I got (...) off with a promotion for baby items over (...) prurchased. I made out! And never had to leave my door! Thanks Amazon! Really!"
2,"Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique."
1,"I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it."
2,"It works like a charm. Well, it won't work over the more secure WPA encryption, but it works great with standard encryption.My complaint: It's clunky. On a computer desktop, it's alright to have something that needs to sit on the desk and connect to the PC with a USB cord. My TiVo, however sits stacked between my DVD player and my XBox. The USB WiFi adapter is forced to perch precariously on the back of the shelf. It'd be better if it was designed to just fit right into the USB port, like the one I bought for my girlfriend's computer (which cost $10 less).The TiVo is supposed to work with other brands of wireless network adapters, but I figured the safe choice was to buy the TiVo brand. Overall, I'm not disappointed."
1,Looks great. Fits our space. Holds right number of bottles for us. But temperature either 40 or 60 degrees. Neither good for storing wine. Cannot get the temperature we want. Would send it back. But major undertaking for me--too heavy and bulky. Keeping as extra frig.
2,"I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better."
1,"We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
2,"How refreshing it is to hear someone sing BIG again! While there are some uncomfortable moments on the album, Clay has definitely shown us what he has to offer the music world. One can't help but feel the urge to grab up some Steve Perry/Journey albums after listening to this. We haven't heard a male voice this soulful since Captain Big Voice (Perry) left the scene. Hopefully this is just the tip of the iceberg."
1,"This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
1,"Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
2,"An aging German pope sends our hero, Michener, on a mission to find the true hidden secrets of the message given by the Virgin to the children of Fatima in 1917. Meanwhile the Pope's Secretary, a scoundrel of the highest order, has his sights set on his life long ambitions of becoming the next pope. In a breathless search through medieval papal archives and to Bosnia, the site of the latest Mary apparition, we are led to a nifty grand finale, as all the pieces fit together to a final ""Proof"" of the Virgin's Mary's Reality, and God's existence as well. This is a lively ride thru Church/ Papal history with interesting characters and settings to match, and I admit I breezed right thru!"
1,"Candide is my favorite book, and I've read it multiple times in boh french and english. This is by far the worst english translation I've come across. It makes absolutely no attempt to preserve the grammatical structure of Voltaire's original, and consequently much of the irony and wit is lost. Read Candide, but not this copy.The Signet edition is not bad."
2,This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
2,It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.
1,"Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
2,"Great product and even better price. If you compare to Costco, Target, etc. you will not find a deal better than this."
1,"Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them !Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought ""Lost Souls"" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !"
2,My wife purchased a pair of rubber soled walking shoes. Would you believe the sole on both shoes opened an the center and needed to be reglued. took them to a local shoemaker and he wanted $22.00 plus tax to repair... No I said...I went to Amazon and purchased Shoe Goo for much less and reglued the soles my self. It worked well. Others suggested that I have plenty of rubber bands availabe and I did and used them to hold the soles in place during the bonding process. I give the product 5 stars.
2,"My daughter has a lot of shoes. She used to just either leave them on the floor or would toss them in a empty laundry basket.The rack was easy to put together and so far have had no problems. It holds all of her shoes and takes up little space.The only drawback I saw was that you see the bottoms of the shoes and you wouldn't want to put heavier shoes all on one side.We are very pleased and if the needs again arises, I will buy another one. I am glad I bought it."
1,"When I ordered the book it was listed as ( like new ) Hog Wash ! the inside of the book was high lighted with yellow lighter and ink pen from beginning to end , there is hardly one page that is not completely marked up. What the heck ? I bought the book for a gift ( one the best book on the planet by the way ) the book is an heirloom, I was very disappointed , the delivery time was good, but the condition of the book is just crap. For me there is no way to correct this at this point, I needed it by this coming Friday... absolute disappointment !Dan Hall"
2,"DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC."
1,Did a ton of research before purchasing a Danby wine cooler...it stopped working after owning it 15 months...just stopped for no reason at all. You are throwing your money away if you purchase this item.
2,"Personally I think this is the best Batman movie ever made. Yeah the car isn't what we all know it to be, but the action and the storyline is quite good. The antagonist is kind of unlike any other movie which is bizarre but at the same time interesting. This is because you actually see Batman with unpredictable struggles rather than not being able to kill his enemy the first time they fight."
2,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
1,"This geek reminds me of a watered down Elton John except that one thing, real talent. She he can sing but at leased Elton John wrote his own songs. Clay's voice sounds a lot like Elton's but too bad his 15 minutes of fame are up. He will always have the words ""American Idol"" written beneath him which is why he will not go far. He is an Elton John-wannabe like Kelly Clarkson is a Mariah Carey-wannabe."
1,"This book isn`t worth the paper it is written on!!It contained nothing of substance.Where did this couple live?What were their last names?What was a day like at home for the mother(Hyacynth)?What were her children like?What was important to her?These are just a few of the subjects not even touched upon by the author.I couldn`t get past the first 100 pages.I hav not read any of this authors other books since Evergreen,which I loved.This book was a waste of my time and money.I will not ever waste anymore money on this authors books."
2,I've had this case for a few months now and still love it. I used the bottom DVD slot for my DVD burner and used the top slot to wrap all the excess cables from the power supply. Keeps the inside of the case clean and simple with good air flow. I purchased a multi card reader with a USB 3.0 port to fit in the floppy slot. Added some ram with led's which lights up the case perfectly. Overall great case. No complaints.
1,"Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again."
2,"Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."
2,"The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!"
2,"I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
1,I didn't look carefully and didn't realize this was only the single...a good live track of Hey Man Nice Shot but I had intended to get the whole album
1,"Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
2,"I agree with everything said by everyone else, but the piece that really really grabs me is ""Jessica's Lullaby"". It's a masterpiece composition and performance, absolutely beautiful!!! I've worn my CD out and I just ordered a replacement."
1,"I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day."
1,The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.
1,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
1,"i think the love brids are hyping this movie up, this is a review from someone that doesnt by into the love movie Douche thing: Not adams best, very repeatative movie. I dont think he will ever make another Happy gilmore, or Billy madison movie."
1,"What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
1,"My son loves the appearance of the shoe, but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description:-leather-Soft, calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper. I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising."
2,"Great book read it when i was a teen, along with all his other books.Bought it as a gift for an aspireing writer"
2,"Look at Charles Sharp's review I totally agree with him. Got this book today, nice book but not for the beginner."
2,this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. I'm addicted. There is nothing sad on this album (except for the very serious song babymother {about becoming an unexpectant father}). It's a feel good CD. Even the leaveamessage track is fun.
1,"The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
2,"This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me."
1,"As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story"
1,"Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
2,"I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended."
2,"This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Pardon me, Mr. Owen, but weren't you a character in ""High Fidelity""?""Dry the Rain"" is as representative of the band as any other song, and I often bob my head while listening to it.That notwithstanding, this is an excellent, quirky cd. Some songs are more straightforward, others are weird instrumental fun. Kind of like Cornershop without the South Asian influence."
2,"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."
2,"When Katherine Tyler, Kit, comes to stay with her Aunt Rachel's family in the Connecticut, she knows her new home will never be the same as her old home, Barbados. Kit doesn't seem to fit in in this strict Puritan colony. When her young sailor friend, Nat, is around, he's always teasing and that doesn't really help, either.Then Kit befriends Widow Hannah Tupper, a.k.a. (also known as), the Witch of Blackbird Pond. With Hannah Tupper, Kit can let go and speak her real feelings. She feels almost as happy as she did back in Barbados. And she cannot understand why everyone is so misunderstanding towards Hannah Tupper.So when Kit's new family warns her to stay away from Hannah Tupper, to avoid trouble from the rest of the town, Kit ignores them. Unfortunately, her friendship with the so-called witch is discovered. And Kit is also accused of witchcraft!"
1,"The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
2,Is one the great anime that will bring tear in your eye. Is very catching and heart breaking same time.
2,Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.
2,"This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion."
1,"Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."
1,"I purchased this product expecting to save some of the shoes with soles that have dry rotted here in the Caribbean and the Shoe Goo wouldn't stay. I tried with several pairs of shoes, from tennis shoes to sandals and the results were poor in all the cases."
1,"Let me just start by saying that I am formally educated in music. Unfortunately, I have the exact same criticism about Clay that many (including Simon) have. He's got a huge voice, but he lacks emotion. He can hit high notes, his voice has a richness, but obvious Clay knows nothing of what he sings about. Song stylists are able to show off their voices and make the audience feel it at the same time. That's the sort of thing that separates the Wayne Newton's from the Bruce Springsteen's....or the Kelly Clarkson's from the Sheryl Crowe's. Mr. Aiken just doesn't have that. Screaming out some notes is not singing, it's just plain screaming. And that's the reason he was voted number two and not number one on American Idol. It's not enough to hit notes, make me feel it...I want to feel what the song is saying. Otherwise, seeing or hearing you perform is not worth the price charged."
2,"This is a fantastic diaper. It can do what it says-- stand up to a 12 hours of peeing overnight. It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box."
2,My 8 year old boy just loves his sword ( the black color and the design). The toy is plastic and very light and SAFE. My son has it for 3 weeks and it's still in good condition so far. Very pleased about the purchase.
2,"Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement."
1,"These guys are in the same category as RPWL. Their music is decent, enteretaining - basically some good tunes. But some of the songs that are longer get boring because there is no new music introduced - they just keep repeating the basic tune. These guys certainly don't come close to the masters of prog like Genesis, Marillion, Flower Kings, IQ, etc. I wouldn't buy any more of their CD's based on this one."
2,Some of there best work. One of the most original bands out. this album was ahead of its time. Awesome!
2,"My husband and I drink instant coffee every morning before going to the office. For a long time I've been seeking the perfect coffee maker to elevate our coffee drinking pleasure, but for many reasons it's just simpler, quicker and hotter to drink instant coffee. So, you might call me an instant coffee connoisseur, because I've tried nearly all the instant varieties available at our local market. I can't say I adore any of them, but Nescafe rises to the top of the list when I rank them by taste, aroma and creme."
1,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you....Jack Wagner reincarnated. Or is it Michael Bolton? Either way, this sound should have died with the 80's. For those who claim Clay is a boy band extension, may I respectfully say: PUH-LEEZE! The kid has a nice voice, but this is not pop music. This is your mom's Kenny G with vocals."
1,"This book poses somewhat of a conundrum. Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise? The answer: it is both! It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa. Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep. If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book. If not, don't bother."
2,"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
2,"When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!"
2,"I bought these diapers because of the incredible deal with the Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom discount combo (note: the price has now increased from when I ordered in June). The diapers are ""good"" in that they haven't leaked. They do not get 5 stars for the following reason: They are a little ""flimsy"". So, even if my daughter doesn't need a diaper change due to contents, she needs a diaper change more often because they lose their shape around her and don't cover her well. I did not have this problem with the Sam's Club brand diapers. So, although they were slightly less expensive per diaper, I have ended up using MORE diapers because I have to change my daughter more often. Other than the ""flimsiness"", I like the diapers."
1,With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this.
1,"I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."
2,"We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand."
2,"This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare."
2,"Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger."
1,"I don't get it. I love this band and have turned numerous friends on to them. All have been impressed, but their DVDs blow! Almost unwatchable due to there is seldom more than 3 seconds and typically 1 to 1 1/2 seconds of viewing without a camera angle change or change to somewhere else on stage. No continuity whatsoever! Dizzying and not in a good way. I was so excited to watch this. Bought both of the DVDs and watched each to about the 5th song before stopping in complete dissappointment. Watch and judge for yourself, but I became quite sour on these guys due to this, though I love their music and I'm sure this feeling will subside, but the DVDs are in the trash. There is ZERO opportunity to ""get in to the song"" with all of the viewing changes. There are so many awesome live concert videos available from numerous bands, but PT DVDs are NOT them! Sorry PT fans, but you must have received different DVDs than I. But do go and buy ALL of their CDs. Great Band!"
1,"Well, i bought this monitor about 2 months ago.. at the time i also needed a tv..so i thought this was a great buy..took it home set it up and boy it was awesome...the picture was great..(internet)....evrything was fine until about a month after i noticed that it would just shut down..then i would try to turn it back on and it wouldnt..so it takes for me to unplug for a few min then restart..since then it still shuts down..or freezez...i think that this item in general is defective..i noticed other people had the same problem..as of right now im waiting for my replacement..."
2,"Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."
2,"I subscribed this item at Amazon once two months, Great service! I usually got it the day after the subscribed date. Amazingly fast!"
1,See this move for Matt Schue. I think that is his name. If it is the long haired blonde dude. He is so hot.
1,"All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
2,"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"
1,"Wow. This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything."
2,"This is an amazing Catholic movie which portrays the entire life of the great Saint Padre Pio. It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways. This movie has an amazing ending so it is worth watching until the end."
2,"If you want the best Oasis for the Oasis sound, purchase ""Definately Maybe"" or ""The Masterplan."" If you want a great album of a different sound, buy ""Be Here Now."" The band was on its best behavior and performance, taking the time to make 12 quality tracks.Some of the top tracks, ""D'You Know What I Mean,"" ""Fade In/Out"" ""Magic Pie"" and ""All Around the World."" I hope that on their next album, Noel takes the time to sing lead on a few more songs. I have yet to hear a bad Oasis song with him singing lead."
1,"The movie infatuated sub-literate ""reviews"" of this adaptation immediately turned me off, they can probably only ingest it in audio format. The Amazon no-name who misspelled HARLAN ELLISON's name didnt help, he's a vastly better writer than roth, and the only reason I was going to buy these tapes, guess not."
1,"The book is full of religious references, and not especially helpful overall. I would not recommend this book for anyone dealing with angry people or angry themselves."
2,I did't buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch movies that I had on my computer. The quality was not that bad and setup was fairly easy. Just follow the directions and your set. This card comes with an s-video output so it doesnt look that bad when it goes on tv. The price is pretty good and it does its job. The only expensive thing was when i had to get long audio and s-video cables.
2,"This is the best tragedy ever written. I wish this had professional audio! I recommend this book to any, and everyone."
1,"I ordered the Dashmat under the premise that it was an easy install, being mechanically retarded this appealed to me....lol...I'm sure it would have been easier had the velcro that came with it actually stuck to the dash. I did what the instructions said, clean the dash thoroughly with a mild solution, NO Armoral, my dash hadn't seen Armoral in 10 years in fact. So after fighting, sweating, and swearing over the non-sticky velcro I found myself at the auto store looking for industrial strength velcro. After about 2 hours I had it installed."
1,This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author.
2,Very good product. Just a advertised. Was worth every little penny I spent! Very happy with this purchase! Awesome! Pleased!
1,"I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
2,"After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly."
2,"This is a great cd if you loved the music in the game. It seems to cover songs from the begining of the game to the very end. It has ocarina songs, main themes, store songs and more. I've had the cd a week and I love it. Overall this is a great cd and I recomend this if you love the music in the game."
1,"This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money."
1,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."
1,I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart.
1,Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
2,"I bought 2 of these for both my husband and me. The review that said it was a little too small for men's shoes doesn't apply to us. My husband wears an average size 10 shoe and has no problem fitting several pairs of shoes on this rack. Assembly is very easy and once assembled, the shelves swivel so you can easily get to any shoe. It's also very sturdy and quite large. If I have to say anything negative at all, it would be that it's almost too big to put two of them in one 6 x 10 walk-in closet. Other than that, it is a perfect alternative to leaving shoes on the floor. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,Simple if you ride Dressage or know some one who does they should get this magazine.It keeps you up to date with what's going on I'n the sport and has great articles from different experts every month.Great Gift
2,"Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem)."
1,"The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more ""transfers"" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma ""studios"" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie? Who knows...you can barely see it. If Troma gets its hands on the great ""Suspiria"" there is no God."
1,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
2,"The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book."
1,"This book is essentially the same as ""The Brave New World"" but expressed in a totally different way. Somehow, I like the ""The Brave New World"" better. It gave me a totally different view."
2,"I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
1,i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos
2,This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
2,"We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff."
1,"I have never seen the British version, but we liked the American ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. Series 2 is a disappointment, the action seems contrived, and so do the characters. We couldn't believe a minute of it. If you are a fan of the American version you will probably have to have lowered expectations to enjoy this."
2,"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
1,Several of these diapers broke at the side seams causing the gel material to fall out and leave a trail everywhere our toddler went until we finally figured out where it was coming from. Happened with three more diapers in order and after vacuuming for over one our we gave up and tyre the rest out.
1,"This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps..."
1,"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book."
1,"John Rewald,you should be ashamed.$400 for a lousy 50 color plates(I live in Australia,and it sells for $650).If you're going to put out a catalogue raisonne of an artist,you should have the majority of the works in color,no-one wants to look at b/w reproductions anymore.You just have to compare this with the magnificent catalogue raisonne's on Rothko,Gauguin and Sargent,to see how this work falls short.A major dissappointment."
1,"These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
1,I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh
1,"The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
2,"This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948)."
2,"I adore this movie! The actors are phenominal the story is incredible, I don't have a bad thing to say about it. Simply the best telling of this story ever!"
1,"I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!"
1,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
2,"An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
1,"The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little."
2,This adapter was just what we needed to put new life into our old Mac. The power now stays on to allow for hours of use. It works great! Thanks!
2,"I actually got to enjoy listening to Rebecca in person last month. She is a joy to hear. For being so young she certainly has a presence about her. Even my husband - who isn't necessarily ""into"" Celtic type music truly enjoyed the concert. I purchased her CD at the concert which she graciously signed for me. It is wonderful! ! Something that I will be listening to for a long time to come. I will also be looking forward to her next CD to see how she has grown with her music. I hope that people will give her Cd a try. She truly shines as an artist."
2,Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.
1,I am a amazon customer since Aug2010 but i never had this kind of experience that my account is charged several times in a month and same product is dumped into my home.When check with the customer care they are saying i might hit the button several times so my subscription duplicated and hence i am receiving the same product multiple time.I don't know how it is possible.Finally i am able to cancel my account.So be care full when you are subscribing and check you account(credit/debit) attached to the subscription frequently.
1,being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake.
1,"Rumor has it that Cinnamon Moonpie (better known as C-Murder) had wanted to title his CD ""Trapped in a Man's Ass"", but his handlers warned that it might dampen sales. They also forced him to change some of the more explicitly homoerotic lyrics into more standard gangsta bling-bling tropes. Personally, I think the original concept would have been a refreshing change of pace. I've been waiting for a long time for a rapper with the guts to admit he's not afraid to love another man in the most intimately physical way. We've known for years about CM's tastes and proclivities, but the hypocrisy of the music biz forces gay rappers to hide their true nature beneath transparent macho posturing, lest they alienate their more dimwitted, less progressive fans. But if you read between the lines, it's pretty clear what they're really on about.Say it loud, say it proud, my beautiful gay black brothers!"
2,The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy.
2,Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center.
2,"The ""Texas Beach Music"" we have learned to love has returned in it's full glory with 13 delightful songs! So good to hear the special sounds of the beach on a live CD. Mike nails it when he says in the opening song ""The name (band) has changed but the song remains the same"".Close your eyes, imagine you are in Margaritaville and take a journey to the Gulf Coast, ""Beach People, Beach Music"" will surely take you for a nostalgic journey. The CD has something for everyone, some Buffett cover songs like Pencil Thin Mustache, some beach favorites and some songs that I had not heard before. There is even a song with a strong Cajun flavor and sailing music for those so inclined. Sunday Morning in New Orleans is a smooth ballad that alone is worth the price of the CD.A great band making beautiful ""Beach"" music for all us Buffett/Parrothead/Island people.Billy Peoples AKA The Old parrothead"
1,"I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."
1,"This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."
1,"Warning -- the two songs listed as ""Little Steve"" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!"
1,Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.
1,"This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it."
2,"I've read few dating books from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Author will show you the most common mistakes guys do when dating with women. It really makes dating simple and fun. Thanks Corey!"
1,"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW! I was forced to read this book for my english class. It was terrible! Sure the plot line, and even some of the characterization was fine, but MY GOD THE DESCRIPTION goes on and on and on and on. Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building! If I was given the choice between reading this book, or hitting myself in the head with it for the rest of my life, I would go with the hitting on the head one...becuase i'm sure its even less brain-numbing than Hardy's writing."
2,"Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!"
1,"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
2,For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
2,Absolutely outstanding movie...thought it was better than the Dark Knight 1. I highly recommend this movie. I also love the fact that an on demand Amazon online version came with the movie. I was able to watch the movie instantly without having to wait for it to be delivered (extremely fast I might add).
1,"This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price."
2,I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
1,Tivo is a great product but this one was defective and I had to send it back and upgrade. Delivery was prompt and product was packed wll.
1,I received this HD DVD twice. Both were defective as neither would even boot.
1,"This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
1,"It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses. The nutdriver is too big for the nut.(The same was true for the other key chain product I bought) I currently use a tweezers to tighten them, which does scratch the glass by the base of the nut. I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers."
1,It's a bummer as initially it worked amazingly well. Started to short out and ultimately failed quickly. Looking for a replacement and am not sure what that will be.
2,"I loved this book! I suggest it for anyone who knows how Brooklyn was at that time.Because both my parents and also two of my grandparents were New York city kids. I am only a 13 year old girl but I have an adult reading level. I think this book had an incredible plot and some of the most wonderfull charecters ever written about. Learning of Francie's life, her thoughts and her pain was incredibly interesting."
2,This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12.
1,"I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back."
1,The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
1,The parts are defective and not what is shown on package. The round top ring that holds the bag ends up being at a 45 degree angle because the side bars are defective. What is seen on package is not what is in package so the final product is not at all what is advertised.
2,I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
2,"While the song selection doesn't allow much room for Clay's awesome glory notes, his amazing voice shines through loud and clear! This album is definitely POP and will forever dispell the Broadway comments often hurled in his direction! Every song on this CD will pull you in...there are no losers here!"
2,"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
2,"I love every song. Each song is so unique and versatile in melody that I play it several times a day. Can't seem to get enough of him. Also bought the Christmas cd. Best songs are from Clay and Kelly, all the rest are ok."
1,very badly sized and can't return it since I washed it before trying it on
1,"NO COMMENTS, JUST DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK, STARING AT A WALL FOR 2 HOURS WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING."
1,Sure this is an interesting book. Unfortunately the copy we received was written in spanish!
2,"I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"
2,AWESOME MOVIE!!! Trilling-Action-Packed!! Begins back your childhood!! Love it!!! MUST SEE IT!! GREAT FOR A MOVIE NIGHT FOR FRIENDS OR FAMILY!!!
2,After reading the previous reviews we decided to take a chance and purchase. We're glad we did. The unit is sturdy and solid and it's a bargain compared to others we've seen first hand. Would buy again without question.
2,"This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack's Apple's green & orange light around the charging tip. To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15"" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms. And I prefer this one much more over Apple's when traveling. Highly recommend!"
1,"This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill."
2,"Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed."
2,"Excellent!! Lyrics, melody, heart and that VOICE. I love all of the tracks but ""The Way"" is the best song I've heard in years. It will be a #1 hit for Clay. Thanks Clay!"
2,"I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow"
2,LOVED IT! It was worth the wait. Clay's voice is amazing! I can't wait until his next CD. I especially love Measure of a Man and Invisable...........
