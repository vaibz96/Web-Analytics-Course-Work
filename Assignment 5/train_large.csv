1,"Being a big fan of the genre, I had read quite a few of Steve Berry's books and enjoyed them up to this point. But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion. When I finally arrived at the conclusion that is so terrible it felt like I got punked by Berry, I physically threw the book down in disgust.I have never read such a terrible book in my life.Goodbye Steve Berry!"
1,"This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a ""classic"" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!"
1,"The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious ""ideology"".He needed to give ""evil"" a face... and Manson was convenient.""Helter Skelter"" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."
2,"I wear large shoes, mens size 14 U.S.A. so I have to use every other spot, but it still works great! before I got this shoes littered my room because I ran out of slots under my bed. I didnt want to get rid of shoes because I color coordinate (fashionable, [...]). If I had more room, i woulld order a second one of these bad boys to sit next to the other one. too bad i dont =("
2,"As the product description does not list the contents of the book, I will:Chapters1) Writing and the study of English composition2) Good writing as composition3) Narration and description4) Exposition and argumentation5) Paragraphs6) Sentences and words: style7) Style: correctness8) Style: economy and increment9) Style: pure movement10) Style and composition11) Methods and applicationsThis book is an insightful guide to writers seeking to increase the cohesiveness and progression of their writing. I would not recommend this to someone looking to learn to write, but to someone looking to write more effectively. It pulls together all styles of writing and discusses the elements common to these styles that make writing more effective. The working premise of this book is that effective writing achieves what you wish it to achieve, and that clarity and progression should be a writer's primary concerns."
1,"List price over $500, $300 here. That would sound good--except this exact ladder (Type 1, 22 foot, model 10303) is only $259 at the Little Giant website with free shipping, $249 from Home Depot again with free shipping. So the 'free work platform' is actually costing $40-$50 dollars...which is not exactly a bargain.I did eventually get one of these ladders and as long as you don't mind the weight (too much for my wife) they are amazingly convenient."
1,"Ok this stuff is terrible. These reviews have to be fake. Like other reviewers have noted, because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick, it makes it completely useless. Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big. You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful. I'm having much better success with it. You get what you pay for."
2,"I ordered this for a Christmas Party I will be attending this year. I ordered red, but became worried it would be more of a fire engine red...it actually turned out to be a deeper color and is GORGEOUS! I am absolutely happy with it. It was delivered quickly. I put it on this morning when I received it and it fits perfectly. The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom, so I'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit. However, I would recommend it...I'm a pretty big girl and it fits me well and looks great! Thanks!"
1,The video version I ordered was not what I thought I was going to receive. I bought one to view and one to give as a gift. It was very dark with distorted characters and a great disappointment. It was hard to see at times and very unacceptable. In conscience I couldn't keep the one for me nor could I give the other as gift. That is why I returned both copies for a refund. Why do you not create a more modern colored version of Ahmal and the Night Visitors for a DVD?Thank you for reading my thoughts on this subject.
1,"If you have access to templates, or internet @ home etc. this book is not useful. I really don't understand the great reviews here. I think that someone could get the same information by strolling the internet for resume tips. Perhaps the information used on some websites is taken from this book. This is a petite to the point book, which is a plus and a minus because while it provides some advice, it is not useful on a regular basis which is why I refer to gathering the information online for free."
1,"Okay, Clay Aiken may be a dork in person, but the fact of the matter is he won runner up in American Idol and can sing, and that's about it.When I saw him on American Idol, I was disgusted! Clay sings cheesy awful ballads that make you want to hit the ""mute"" button on your remote. What's even more disgusting is his God-awful wardrobe! The fact that so many teenage girls out there are so in love with Clay makes me want to vomit!!! This music is for nerds only! GET REAL!!!!"
1,"I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more."
1,"I love Clay's voice and I bought this album and I will buy the next. I think this album is overproduced and all the songs sound the same. I hope Clay's next album brings more personal meaning to his songs, and let's his voice come through more. I'm still a huge fan, I think his producers missed the mark unfortunately."
1,"Although the subject matter is excellent, as are the stories, the editing is very poor. Editing in such a way as the tape ends in the middle of a story is uncalled for in this day and age.Brokaw needs to understand words beginning with an x are sounded as if starting with a z. Thus, Xavier University is pronounced as ""Zavier"" and not ""Exavier."" For a professional, this is simply unacceptable."
1,"I have had the TV for two weeks. The picture quality is very inconsistent. It ranges from completely fantastic to unwatchable. For me, the most annoying problem is that the TV over processes images to create lot of artifacts. Human skin can look very unnatural and pixelated.I don't know if I got a poor sample or it is endemic to Samsung TVs. Some posters on avsforum have reported the same problem.Buy at a local store so you can return it, there is a good chance that you might not like it."
2,it is one of the the best pmp's around . a great LCD and really good looks wit a 30GB capacity . well the price is a bit on the expensive side ........when compared to the archos AV420 which is at 306$ wit the capability of video recording facility . . . . .well i bought a creative and i dont regret it at all . . . . . excpt they could have put in the recording facility .it will be the best one around .
2,i think sudden fear is a very good example of the so called films noirs and also joan crawfords performace is very convincing as the frightned woman who tries to save her life as well as she can
1,"I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged, exposing the outer wire. I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse. I'm sure this won't be an issue if you aren't traveling with it, but I just thought I would relate my experience."
2,"This story broke my heart. I could not put this book down until I read the whole story. I am amazed at what this child had to go through before someone recognized that she was dyslexic and needed help in order to learn to read. It made me wish that every child had a place they could go where they felt safe and cared about, where no one would make fun of them because they could not read or write or do math, skills that most children take for granted. It made me realize that schools should provide every child a place to go where they felt safe and cared about, a place such as the resource room and teacher as described in this story. It also made me realize how important it is that teachers learn to recognize signs of dyslexia in children in their classrooms and bring it to the attention of appropriate school personnel. This is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend for teachers, parents, and educational/school psychologists to read."
2,"I discovered this book years and years ago in the fourth grade. The thought of it stayed with me through the years. I bought the book for my friend's son a couple years ago and reread it to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was even better because as an adult I can see some of the most important themes of the book that weren't evident to a child. Tolerance and acceptance are perhaps the biggest lessons of all to take away from it. Independence is another. I will continue to buy this book every time a child close to me comes to the age where they can understand it. The plotline is enough to keep them interested while at the same time teaching them valuable life lessons, without them even knowing it."
1,"This is a very, very long film, but poor performances make it longer. $24 is a lot to pay for an incomplete story line."
2,"The second installment of the Narnia series. The blockbuster movie of the beloved classic by C. S. Lewis. Peter, Mary, Edmund, and Lucy return to Narnia to help free the Narnians from invaders. They join forces with prince caspian to triumph over evil once again and save Narnia."
2,i hope this review finds it's way to the write place..I enjoyed this book/found it thought provoking and moving<sprinkled with a fair bit of humor and real life drama. One truly gets the impact of the trials and tribulations of a muscians journey.
1,"Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it."
2,First I love John Wayne movies. I remember seeing this one when I was younger and wanted it. I really like the movies where you knew the Stars (not just actors/actresses who are here today for a couple movies and who knows them after that). I also love the movies of the 40s-early 60's as they told stories that you could also use your imagination on. That is not telling/showing me every detail that belongs in the bathroom and bedroom using vulgar language as well.
2,"Very good amount for the price. Smells nice too. However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry. I was wanting something a little different, a little younger. Still smells pretty good though. Curve smells better in the men cologne to me."
2,I'm never surprised by anything Connie Francis does. In this album she takes on the greats from Patsy Cline to Hank Williams and does not disappoint. Well worth the purchase for any Connie Francis and Country fan.
2,All of these books that I have ordered are excellant. My grandaughter has me read them at least three times a day. We are both very happy w/ them.
2,"We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; Coriolanus"
2,Provides many yoga-based stretching exercises that are great for people who spend a lot of time working at a desk or some other sort of sedentary occupation.
1,"This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's ""Dreams in the Witch House.""It's not a good Masterton book, either. The last 30 pages seem as if he had to get it done fast, or be sued by the publisher.Skip it. ""Spirit"" is a lot better."
1,This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book.
2,"in not sure what to think i have read alot of other reviews but reading all of those have made me change my mind alot. at first i thought it would be sooooo cool to get one but then they sounded kinda boreing, then when i read how much it was like a tomagotchi i got really extited. i have luved tomagotchi ever scence i got one for christmas, and have been playing neopets ever scence it started. i luv neopets so much and cant wait to get my own pocket neopet. i have changed accounts alot but look me up at jportune"
1,"Drew Barrymore sparkles, as always. Unfortunately, the male characters are all shallow, dirty minded, and creepy. At the point where the Hawaiian guy puts coconuts on his chest and tries to lick his [...], I gave up. I should have given up earlier, but I hardly ever give up on a film. This is definitely a movie geared toward teenage boys developmentally delayed between the stages of potty training and early puberty."
1,Terrible Keanu Reeves supernatural epic that even makes the last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to it. Keanu does give the worse performance of his career with this turkey and the film itself is almost as bad as his performance with sloppy dialog and lackluster special effects. Rachel Weisz literally gives the only good performance in the entire movie and that's really because she is the only professional actor in it. The rest of the cast is made up of no name actors who make Keanu look like a genius in the acting profession.See it if you are desperate for entertainment or can't get a date.
1,Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
2,This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his reading list. It was an excellent used copy and a great value for the money.
1,The Rhomba is cheaply made. Mine stopped working completely after about two months. Piece of garbage.
1,"I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
2,"Take advantage of a superbly produced Video and Narration! If like us, you have never been to Alaska, you can enjoy it's grandeur through the Lens and Narration of Cliff Fenno in such a way that you will be convinced you are actually taking the trip with he and his wife. The author obviously has a deep love and respect for the Wildlife and the Alaskan Wilderness that he so expertly captures on the video. He narrates the Alaskan Scenic Wonders in such a personal, down to earth way that you cannot help but develop a great appreciation for what may well be the last of the North American Wilderness! We believe this video can stimulate the interest and imagination of viewers of all ages."
1,"This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
2,"This reasonably short book summarizes the basics of personal finance in an easy to read witty style. It's aimed at the intelligent but beginning investor looking for practical advice and guidance on investing and money management. Although it does discuss buying options, day-trading, etc. readers looking for detailed comprehensive information and advice on these and similar topics probably should look elsewhere (or perhaps they should look here first-- after reading this book they might think twice about investing in more complicated schemes). For those looking for sound unbiased advice and information on basic investing and money management however this book will be very helpful. And as an added bonus, its actually fun and enjoyable to read."
2,"Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power. A dramatic, illuminating read."
1,"While Ross is an excellent writer and I hate to leave a review that nit-picks the format rather than the content, I think it's useful for those considering buying the Kindle edition to be warned that the digital text has numerous obvious copy errors, seemingly created when scanning the book: ""candles"" become ""candies"", ""corn"" becomes ""com"", etc., over and over throughout the book. It's usually easy to work out what the word should have been, but it's very distracting and breaks the flow of the text."
1,"Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!"
1,"I purchased another MK315 because I smoked the first one during an electrical storm. I received my Minn Kota MK315 and the first thing I noticed was the poor packaging from AMAZON.com. As heavy as that unit is, they tossed it in a box with a couple of piece of bubble wrap which allowed the unit to beat the outside box and unit box to pieces. Since it was left on my doorstep, wasn't much I could do. Upon installation, the ""Power"" light did not work. Unit seems to charge all three batteries fine. Minn Kota says there is no warranty because I cut the power cord to install in the boat. In their words; ""The MK-315 is a reliable charger. It is unlikely that the charger was defective right out of the box. Unfortunately because the AC plug was altered the warranty is now void. The chargers are a sealed unit and cannot be repaired."" I do believe that will be the last Minn Kota charger I buy!"
2,"This DVD has superior picture than the video version. Its a good film of effects and the audio is far superior on DVD. I thought it sounded smooth and clear and dialog is easily heard. Hugh Crane haunted the house with spookier sounds that were unnoticed on video or in most theaters. I love films, but I am not that picky on the tech spects, but if you want to own this film, get DVD. It rules, and its easy to use for anyone who likes movies."
1,"I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin. I always wear a white undershirt, and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt."
1,"I'm so glad to see others corroborate my experience with this meshuggah printer !Nothing but trouble - paper jams all the time, slow, awful - I thought it was maybe because I was using a Mac but apparently not.STAY AWAY at ANY price !"
2,"A truly, life-changing experience. Magic realism, cyclical time, who could ask for anything more? Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for giving me this treasure and creating a cultural mythos for all of us."
2,"Una excelente gua para todos aquellos que deseen concer ms aobre el vino y su mundo. De forma amena y sencilla explica los principales conceptos y orienta sobre temas bsicos como la eleccin del vino corecto, principales tipos de vino, cmo comprar vino en restaurantes o tiendas, etc."
2,"It was delivered in record time, well under the stipulated period for overseas delivery and in excellent condition. The dvd's were too tightly fitted which made removing them a task, but nothing a bit of patience couldn't fix. Good buy, great service."
1,"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
2,EXPENABLE I thought was a very good book. I normally don't like science fiction but James Alan Gardner is a very good author. EXPENDABLE is truly one of the best books I've ever read.
1,"This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,I am completely happy with purchasing the Silk Stalkings t.v. series season one through six. I am looking forward to more of the t.v. series to come out on dvd. This has been one of my favorite thriller/crime investigation shows from all the ones I have watched. It is a classic. Hopefully Silk Stalkings will release more dvds on Amazon.
1,"The system required a check in the rating box so I gave it a one, which is probably two too many. I have tried/owned two of these devices. The concept is good, but that is the end of the line for this product. As someone else noted the bands are not strong enough to withstand even an attempt to put your finger thru the finger holes. I even continued to try and use mine after the first hole tore loose with continued failure of the bands. At the price even if used as a squeeze ball it is too expensive."
2,"From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years."
2,"THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING."
2,"Not certain if this is the best VALUE, but it was certainly convenient. The interior touch up spray is wonderful. Highly recommend Maguires products."
2,"This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
2,"This album is pretty good, but as for Roger's new direction, he is now an atheist with a severe hatred for the Christianity he once preached. Which brings up the question of was he ever truly saved at all. And if he wasn't can this album truly be considered Christian? Some thoughts to wrestle with... On a strictly musical review this and Once Dead are great albums but after Roger kicked out, or had a falling out with the other band members the music suffered. If the pauses were taken out between the songs on Destruction Comes, (In which Roger plays all of the guitars as well as sings) you would seriously think it is all one long song. pretty sad."
2,"Great item, keeps my coffee warm throughout the work day. I do wish there was an automatic shut off after so long, though because I get paranoid about that kind of thing."
1,"Ok, so they had a good thing going for a while with the super villains in season eight, but rather than actually finishing a story line, they drop it and start over with something else. LAME"
2,"but the one thing that i didnt exepted is the end of the movie i didnt exept it like that, it wasnt on my mind i was thinking that something terrible will happening when i saw the movie at the first but i cant tell it`s a bad! it`s not couse it is an old movie you exept any thing couse its old but at the end it is a classic movie i cant say it`s horror half by half"
2,"This album always has been essential in a tecno pop collection and it reachs its madurity with the DTS mix.Gosh, it seems to listened to new a thing. I was so used to listen to this record with the originally hoarse sound. Like if you put your speakers facing to the floor. But now it's so clean so when you listen to it new sounds come up like if they never have been there before.Such a nice experience. Sit in middle of those 5 speakers and you won't regret it.There is only one thing I would have change. I now the originally lp press came out without the bonus tracks but, since everybody is used to the cd version, they should have put the whole tracks together and not separated, so in order to play them you have to get into a new menu.Enjoy it while it last."
2,"Remember those cassettes friends used to make for you of their favorite music? Well, they're back, only they're called Proper Boxes! The sound is nowhere near as bad as on those Complete Duke Ellington 1925-38 sets you can buy in Germany for about 20 dollars. Those sound like they were recorded in a toilet over the telephone. But this set is certainly not all it could have been. Somewhere I read somebody ask the question ""Proper versus JSP?"" That's not even a question. JSP's have fantastic remasterers doing their best. This set is only serviceable. But the music is wonderful and many of the tracks are almost impossible to find. So you have to get it. Should I review the music? No, not this time...Maybe later."
1,I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
1,"I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead."
1,"We couldn't be more disappointed with these diapers. We bought them for our 20-month old daughter to wear at nighttime and not once have they kept her dry. They leak through the front, the legs, the back, you name it. Really poor quality and they've put us off Pampers for life. Stay away."
1,"This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. You find in the case a coupon for the 3D version coming out ""Soon!"" Bite me Paramount. I'm taking this back for my money. Keep the coupon. What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people."
1,"This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop."
1,"This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
2,"For many years I avoided Viet Nam era war movies. It seemed hollywood was never able to present a reasonable portrayal of the period. This movie never seemed to grope with that problem. I've read reviews of this film that criticize Fox's acting (both his ability and style), trying to say he's no different in this film than in his prior comedy roles. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fox delivers a powerful yet believeable performance in Casualties of War. He becomes a seasoned combat soldier while at the same time retaining his humanity. I will also agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that this movie is one that leaves you feeling drained but remains one to keep because it is full of emotional content, superb acting, and a well told tale."
1,This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big. But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well.
2,"hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
1,"I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect."
1,"The fuse blew within minutes of use, not sure what happened. I was running an out (non-powered) from my receiver to the AMP-100 playing my exterior speakers. Within about 25-30 minutes it stopped working. At first I thought it was my new receiver but later discovered that the Amp-100 blew a fuse. I replaced the fuse, but it still didn't work. Thankful Amazon's return policy!"
2,This is a good product as it helps me keep a better grip on the PDA. It would have been a lot better though if it fit a little more tightly.
2,"This book is a magical account of meetings with a Christian Pastor and the son of the Founder of the Baha'i Faith, Abdu'l-Baha. Set back in 1912, you will feel as if you were there for these intimate talks with two very enlightened men. My heart was filled with joy and my eyes with tears in reading and experiencing a trip back in time to a spiritual world full of mysteries This book will leave you with a sense of joy, peace and awe at the Glory of God and our purpose in this life. This very personal book will pierce your soul."
2,"This is a textbook, and as such, the reader should not expect to be able to breeze through it. I read it over the course of a month, highlighting the most important points with a yellow marker, just as I did my textbooks in college. The effort was well worth it. I now feel that I have a practical basis upon which to evaluate the chart of any stock. I know when to buy, when to sell and when to sit and wait. My investing strategy is 1000% better than it was a year ago, and I owe it all to this book."
2,"Want to have a little fun with your guests before you give them alcohol? This is a perfect gift, or conversational piece at a party. It's not impossible, but def makes one work to get the wine bottle out to drink."
1,"We didn't receive this item and called the company to ask why. They said they are no longer making them, but neither the company nor Amazon had bothered to let us know. We did not get a refund as it dragged on and on. I suggest that Amazon discontinue their relationship with parts of the LEGO company. Our grandson was very disappointed as he is a huge LEGO fan. Shame on you, LEGO."
2,"The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing."
1,"While I absolutely love the four agreements and return to the original book often, I found the companion book to be completely unnecessary. The writing style was poor and rambled in circles, constantly repeating itself. There was no new information at all. I seemed to me to be a way to get a little more money out of the concept - shocking considering the author.I did enjoy the last few pages of personal examples from people who had incorporated the four agreements into their lives.If you have the four agreements original book, you don't need this one and if you don't then skip this one and get the original."
2,"Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page. A woman's body is found in the snow in Central Park. There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult. Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending. It is one of her best. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
1,"I purchased the Triad version of this fantastic movie that said it was the ""Remastered Edition"" it was NOT remastered - the quality was so poor that I had to purchase another copy from VCI Entertainment which is THE BEST QUALITY THAT I HAVE SEEN!"
2,"I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. If I had to chose one CD to be stranded with on a desert island, this is it! All Nighwish is good but this is there greatest, and most epic. Tarja has the most amazing voice, and makes this metal in a catagory all it's own. You have just got to hear it, I can explain the way this album can make you feel. The classical of the future!"
2,"I picked this up a few days ago and have briskly read through the entire novel since then. This is undoubtedly an epic masterpiece. It is one of the best science fiction books I have read to date. The main strength of the novel is a strong story with an excellent setting. The world is one of ancient religions, literal god-like beings, and advanced technology hiding under the mask of supernatural power. I will not spoil the story but will only say that it is told on an epic Lord of the Rings type scale. The allusions to Eastern philosophy and religion is pretty awesome too. For a sci-fi novel the characters were pretty good. They weren't great like in a Dostoevsky novel, but they weren't completely one-dimensional as is the case in too many sci fi novels. In all, it was masterful. If I ever become a sci fi author, Roger Zalazny would be one of my primary role models."
2,"...especially if you know someone who was in WWII. I bought a copy for my father - a retired AF Colonel, who was in WWII. We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Tom Brokaw at the VFW in South Dakota in Nov. 1998 as he toured the country looking for vets whose stories he could share on his television special in Jan. 1999. If you could have seen the look in my father's eyes as he relived some of his best and worst memories. If only I could have had an autographed copy of the book. I will settle for a picture of my father and me as we talked with Tom about his days growing up in So Dakota and his love for the brave soldiers that worked so hard to maintain the freedoms for all of us. God Bless you all.....all of you who have ever been to battle. Only you can know it's horror. Our thanks is all we have to offer."
1,"The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company."
2,"'Meddle'/'Atom Heart Mother' era Pink Floyd. That's not a bad thing -- that's a good thing (I did say 'Meddle' era, not the later stuff, after all) V-e-r-y atmospheric, v-e-r-y psychedelic. Oh, I know, it's probably neither of those things to a lot of you, but that's MY take on this collection. And it's probably a reference more people can relate to than obscure/British bands a lot of people have never heard of. Hey, I LIKE this cd. But I didn't find it groundbreaking. It's simply tilling some ground that hasn't been harvested in a while."
2,"The majority of cuts on the CD are run of the mill soundtrack fair. That being said, the CD is worth the purchase price for ""Until"" written and performed by Sting. I predict it will become an ageless favorite!"
1,"Would it ever be excepted during World War II for a Jewish girl to befriend a Germain? How about a Nazi? This book is all about breaking the rules and following your heart. Patty comes from a family where the only person who loves her is their maid Ruth. But, that all changes on day when she is working in her father's shop and some of the POW soilders come in and she meets on who is not like the rest. He is handsome, smart, and extremely liturate. After that one time meeting all she can think about is him. One night she sees' him going and trying to hope a train and see calls to him and he comes to see her. She then hides him in her garage. She then sees' an add in the paper saying that Anton was missing from the camp. She was questioned by agents. So will she tell them everything they want to know? Or will she save her Germain soidier?"
2,This is an eminently readable translation though I still prefer Arthur W. Ryder's translation. I believe Ryder's translation is currently out of print.
1,"This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."
1,"First of all, to the reviewer below me who called him ""a true American idol""--no, he's not. Even I know he lost, and I don't even watch that show. Next, his song ""Invisible"" is one of the worst I've ever heard. It shouldn't be ""If I WAS invisible""; it should be ""If I WERE invisible."" Plus, if you were invisible, you'd ""Watch me in my room?"" Mommmmy!"
1,"It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with."
2,"Plankton steals the king's crown. Patrick and SB go to a dangerous city and get back the crown. Lots of tushy jokes.Dad says: Also featured are David Hasslehoff's pecs, cute princess Mindy who has a heart, sundae binge drinking and secret plan Z in this kind-of coming of age movie."
1,This c.d. is definitly not what you are expecting. Some of the songs have like 3 different words fpr like five minutes. I definitly don't recomend it.
1,"I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. I did not look at the reviews, and immediately regret it upon receiving my Zen garden. The other reviews summed it up nicely. The product is exactly what you pay for.Image:[...] - You can see the gap between the border/frame and the bottom piece. The tacks were put in, but did not hold the board to the border/frame. You should probably buy some wood glue, push lightly to separate the border, then press it back together with a small vice."
1,"I didn't find the Descent to be a very interesting film. It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere."
2,"So much will be left unsaid about my love for ""Tree"". I'm only 16 years old and I was introduced to the Noland family 2 years ago. This is a book that will bring tears to my eyes, a smile on my face, and countless hours of being locked up in my room imagining that I am living in a flat in Brooklyn- 1917. Thank you Betty Smith for bringing this book into my life. -Sarah Homan"
1,"DON'T BUY! NOT EVEN FOR A PENNY!! I'm a #1 No Doubt fan and this cd totally sucked!! I bought it because I thought I stumbled onto something rare. It has nothing to do with the band, just heresay and nothing at all interesting! an english lady reads it and there's no NO Doubt music at all. It wasn't even written by no doubt and it contains no real info just when their albums came out and what label. I buy EVERYthing that's no doubt and I wouldn't spend a dollar on it!!"
1,"I found the author to be overly dramatic and dreadfully overused tired cliches and crude, offensive language. She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much."
1,"I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless."
2,"I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the ""Roman"" church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"
1,"I was living in England when it first came out and I thought it was pretty fun and catchy and fit in well with my surroundings. But the unimaginative beats, rote guitar solos and Liam's incessant whine started to grate after the while. ""Slide Away"" is still an excellent tune, but the rest...blah."
2,"I have had this Model Sansa View MP3 since it first came out in 2005-2006. It remains durable & in perfect working condition. I store music and pics on it and have never had any issues. I was my first and only MP3 player until I bought an iPhone this year (2011). However, I still use the Sansa View for the gym because it's light weight ( I also have the arm case that goes with it for working out). I highly recommend it if your are looking for a quality MP3 player. I purchase and download music from the web-sit it gives you at purchase and i also transfer music from my Windows Media Player on my PC. Too Cool!!!"
1,"The first time I saw Clay on American Idol, in his audition, I said to myself ""theres the winner"". The first time I listened to Clay's album, I said to myself ""theres a winner who has been turned into a junky commercialized pop-culture phenomena, exploited with traditional sappy songs that were handed to him by writers, and oversung in a way that only a person who has sung 100 songs on TV that all sound exactly the same can.""Poor Clay- in a small dose, he has a fine voice. Heck, he could make a really good Broadway performer with his ability to belt 'em out. It's prefabricated crap like this CD that makes me want to spew.A star for Clay's talent, and one for pity. This album truly deserves no credit, because none of it came from the heart."
1,"The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
2,This movie kicks a** all the way and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's an excellent movie!
2,"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? There's a reason why it's a classic and why Jules Verne is still relevant after over one hundred years, he wrote some darn good stories! Every school child should read this book."
2,This movie was great and I wasn't disappointed in it at all. It's definitely a different kind of movie so it's refreshing. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it.
1,"It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant."
1,"I have been using the Pampers Swaddlers for 8 months but decided to try the ""Baby Dry"" because of the reviews and price. What a mistake!!! Do not get these. Every morning, my son wakes up completely wet......leaving the sheets & mattress cover wet too. When the diaper gets wet, the moisture does not lock away from the baby....and the diaper gets weighed down. They are awful! I just wish I didn't order the 222 count. I am stuck with these for awhile."
1,Hated this movie instantly. It had too much crude humor to be enjoyable. The only good part was the end.
1,"Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."
2,It was the first great book i`ve read and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this book is great.It`s just perfect.i love GGM and his style.He just manges to express feelings so easily and everything in this book seems perfectly beliveable even if some things are magical and don`t get in connection with reality.This book is hard to review.One must read it to understand it.It`s just that one cannot resume this book here.This book must be experienced.
2,"I love this ball. I use it for workouts, and also my chair for at the desk. I find this to be a very sturdy ball. Inflating it was not very hard. I found that if you can use a air compressor that was much easier than the hand pump. It is a very sturdy ball and not a lot of things stick to it which is nice for around the house. It was also big enough for me to use, I am 6'2 so if your tall this will work for you."
1,"You could not pick a more annoying instructor than Sheir Bayles. She absolutely ruins this class. The video quality is horrible as are the 80's rejects posing as her audience. My wife (a physician) and I cringed through the entire presentation.If you buy this video after reading my review, you deserve to lose your money AND be subjected to Sheri Bayles for over 5 grueling hours."
2,"I like the story of his life. I like the fact that it was written by him, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who is interested in the real lives and people of our History."
1,"I loved the idea of having all my shoes on a tree that I could spin around, but the end result was messy. It was weird having the soles of my shoes facing outwards. Wherever I put the tree seemed like a dirty place. I replaced the tree with drop-front clear plastic shoe boxes that I love."
1,John Steinbeck uses too many cuss words in this book. I think George should have watched Lennie more so he wouldn't get into so much trouble all of the time. This book isn't really worth reading if you have a choice. It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense.
1,Oasis arrogance is way out of proportion to their actual talent which is miniscule. If you want something real buy any album from The Beatles or the Beach Boys. This is music for people that get excited about strip malls.
1,"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."
1,"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book. The book's very existence strives to make this sentiment true."
1,"If you're looking for a finnish fireplace design book, look on. This is a picture book showing how a finnish fireplace design can fit into home decor, containing not any plans or technical information. Disappointing."
1,"I agree with a previous reviewer. The Kindle version is impossible to use, because it has no table of contents or index or any way to look up a term. If you search for ""prime number"" for example, you get 75 hits but there is no indication which one is the definition. Recommend that unless this book is tagged with a table of contents that you stick with the paper copy."
2,hey this ce interview is a must for all hardcore No Doubt fans! there is so much info about gwen and the boys!
1,"1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
2,"I have to say, I haven't bought a Rock/Pop CD in a very long time. I usually by Country. Well suffice it to say, I will be buying everyone of Clay Aiken CDs. This CD is Phenomanol and will defentially be a HIT. You can feel/hear the passion coming from Clay as he sings each and everyone of these songs. It is a Must Buy for anybody who like honest to goodness Rock/Pop Music or for that Matter everybody should by this CD."
2,"Fast Orange, at the best price, buy 2 and get free shipping, a great deal. Need I say more?"
1,"This may be one of the great works of humanity, but it just doesn't cut it for me. The gender sterotypes are nauseating, to say the least. Though required in schools, this book is nnot one of the bests to read on your own time. Or maybe I am just disillussioned."

1,i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny. its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around. but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast. other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better. just goes to show bigger isnt better always. needs more power
1,"I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time."
1,"I read this out loud to my three children when they were young, only one stayed around till the end. Mind-numbingly dull unless one reads it with a funny voice or reads it as a sad tale of the narrator's unrequited love for Captain Nemo."
2,"The texture and taste of the rice cooked in this cooker is superior comparing with those cooked with the usual cheap ones. It's especially good on cooking brown rice. Only 4 stars because it takes longer than the traditional rice cooker (almost 2 hours for brown rice). Though there's a quick cooking option, its result is not as good as the longer hours option. Overall - very satisfied."
1,"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."
2,I've been waiting for this CD for MONTHS...and it was NOT a let down! I LOVE IT! It's SOOO AWESOME...I don't hear one thing wrong with it whatsoever. It's worth every star...and more.
1,"Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
2,"The book, of course, is a classic. The illustrations by Inga Moore are delightful. I'm planning on reading it to our grandsons, but they won't enjoy it as much as I do. Like Winnie the Pooh, there's more in it for adults than for small children."
1,"I wanted to like this book but it seemed to shuffle on and not land anywhere. It started out so good and then was slow explain what it was like in paradise. I could imagine that if you were a fantasy fan you may be interested in these details but alas, I was not...skip it."
1,"sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars."
2,"duncan dhu,simplemente un artista moderno que aun usa la guitarracomo los antiguos trobadores.sus canciones son para aquellosque tienen una imaginacion muy amplia para poder interpretara lo que se refiere.espero y este dueto perdure aunque elrock en espaol haiga pasado de moda...si lo han escuchado conatencion sabran a lo que me refiero."
1,"If there was a way that i could give him less than 1 star, or even something in the negative numerical region, that would be it... cause uhh, this cd is DOODOO... why was it i couldn't even listen to the first 5 seconds? Umm... he's not the American Idol, give it up clay, your 15 seconds of fame is about to end... and Ruben Ate you up with his cd..."
1,"If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
2,"This book has great instructions and is the first book you should purchase. It's very clear and informative but also has tons of information on how to get fancier once you are ready. It's very convenient that it stands up.However, I only give it 4 stars because so many of the patterns are ugly. Who is seriously going to wear a lace tank top made of yarn? Or sew crocheted ""lace"" onto a normal t-shirt's collar?I have used the basic patterns many times over and adapted them as I became more skilled. A really great book for beginners, but not really useful for someone who already has crocheted several projects as the patterns are so basic and not all of them are at all usable."
1,"You've heard of B rate spaghetti westerns and B rate scifi, Well I give this ""D"". Gary's son needs to get a really good part with some really good acting in it, or he is gonna be type cast forever. Like the first guy said, If your a fan of really bad Scifi, then this movie is for you. I should have rented it before I bought it. It would have been cheaper, and it wouldn't be in my collection. On a better note, The Asylum does put out some pretty good B rate stuff. Later Dudes."
2,"Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press."
1,"This are horrible for newborns. We had one on and not only did it leak through the diaper, but her clothes, blanket, and on to what she was sitting on. So gross. I won't buy these again. This is what I would expect from a cheap knockoff brand not a name brand. Don't make the mistake of buying this for a newborn.They also don't have the indicator strip, so you have to open to see which is frustrating for a newborn. Pay a little more for swaddlers or huggies because they are a waste of money. I'm donating them to a shelter or something because we can't use these."
2,I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album.
1,Do not buy this game it has bus bugs and more bugs. You cannot finish it. End of story. It gets zero stars. (0)*
1,When my baby did #2 they always leaked. I switched to pampers swaddlers and they are perfect. I ordered these by mistake to begin with.
1,"This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
2,"These do exactly what you need from undergarments for vigorous exercise - provide protection from chafing, wick away moisture, and provide comfortable wear. Strongly recommended."
2,"Only Kate from London got it right about the character played by Julie Waters. One reviewer stated that she was a cockney, and the other said she was a London housewife.Of course she was a Liverpudlian; one who is from Liverpool.The character would not have been nearly as funny had she been from any other place. The accent and Liverpool attitude is what makes this film work so well.One of my favorite movies. Have watched it about eight times over the years. It never looses its luster."
2,"This Blue-ray has great picture and sound, plays awesome on my 46"" LED LCD. I couldn't ask for anything more."
2,"This is by far one of my favorite dvd concert from my collection.The scorpions deliver an amazing show. They really know how to work with the audience,something you don't see much of anymore. If your a scorpions fan you will love this dvd. Get this dvd concert!The video quality is very good . Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker on stage were great!"
2,"It really is a great book it is full of facts. It helps you solve problems and gives you hints for taking the test, most recruiters recommend this, it is also cheaper on here then that garbage store Barns and Noble."
1,"One would think that when spending nearly $200 that is claimed for a book that is claimed to be the be all and end of all courses on its subject it would have at the very least been carefully edited. What you get are two looseleafs into which you insert several hundred typed pages that are replete with spelling and grammatical errors. And, while there is useable material here, you are paying $197 for a thinly veiled manual of huckstering numerous software programs which either pay Internet Market Center commissions or that they own outright. Much of this software is buggy, troublesome and poorly supported, and for the most part much better can be found elsewhere. Same for this so-called course. There is much better out there for much less. Among the numerous worthwhile sources of material are Webonomics, and Make Your Site Sell. Avoid this one despite what IMC's shills want you to believe with their rave reviews."
2,"If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists"
2,Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny. I particulary liked the philosophers. But the greatest character had to be Om.
1,What can you say? Doesn't even sound like Queen in some places. A bit too much disco. There are a couple of good songs though. But this is my least liked Queen album apart from Flash Gordon sound track.
2,"Continuous action and mayhem - it's hard to beat the initial Transformer movie (first one) but ""They"" again did an excellent attept."
1,When THE BLACk CROWES FIRST CAME Out they seem Like they were gonna be Huge.They Had a Strong Southern Rock thing Going On.but as Time has Gone on The Words&Music Seem So/So at best.Diamond Ring&By Your Side were My Favorite Cuts on Here but Other than that I Got The Feeling they were Looking For a New Direction&Couldn't Reach that Point.They Are Missing their Edge.
1,"I ordered:4 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft BeigeThey sent:3 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft Beige -- (Note: See Color inconsistency note below)1 - Almay Liquid Makeup (which I did not order)Each of the 3 Revlon bottles was labeled as ""05 Soft Beige"" but visually looking at the makeup through the glass bottles, side by side, the actual color was markedly inconsistent.Out of the 4 bottles which I ordered, and paid for, only 1 was usable.Due to their lack of accuracy on the order fulfillment and the lack of quality control of the product, I will not order from them again."
2,"Incredible Band !! Incredible performance !! Being a long time PROG fan...Dream Theater, Rush , P Tree, Tool..etc... I love this DVD/Blu-Ray...Looks and sounds great on my new 59"" plasma.. Get it, You won't be disappointed. !! TV not included..sorry.."
2,"When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
2,I wish it had a shut of timer but other than that it works great. I'm going to buy another one.
2,"This mystery novel has been exhaustively reviewed and there is nothing more to add. Still I want to chalk up my 5 stars. During the reading of this book I spent hours on Wikipedia and other internet sites reading everything I could find on Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, and as many other players in this story as I could find, a subject that has never before held any interest for me. Henceforth I will question every so-called ""fact"" of history. Highly recommended."
1,"I bought on of these for $5 in the bargain aisle of wal mart, I bought it just for kicks to see if it would charge my Zune, I was happy to see that it did start to charge my zune and was very happy at that point, thinking that I had finally found a USB charger for my wonderful Zune, Turns out there are 2 major problems here, this unit it way to heavy to carry around on only charged my Zune for about 5 - 10 minutes. I figured that I could always take the whole unit apart and wire it up to the 14.7V system of a car, nope, the battery pack inside is only a 9.6V pack, bad things could happen if you hooked it to 14.7v.For an 1800Mha pack, it should give more than a 10 minute charge."
2,"This CD is so great! Every song is so moving. While I was looking for Clay to show off his voice more, you definitely can hear it in every song. The songs are so clear and beautiful. I am really impressed with the songs, and it is refreshing to hear such talent. I am glad he stayed with what he did. Impressive and good buy for any Clay fan or music lover!"
2,"I'm back. I wrote a review yesterday, having just received the CD and having listened to it approximately 6 times. Since then I've listened to it many, many more times, adding head phones to allow me to hear that magical voice more clearly. The more I listen, the more I love it. Regardless of the flaws I may perceive with the production aspects of the CD, Clay's voice is absolutely stunning--and that's what the attraction has always been in the first place: that voice ! Clay Aiken is one of a kind."
1,If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it. Much of the information is wrong (Frank Tower ??? PLEASE !) The authors reliance on foul language to make his point ... all of this makes this book an annoying piece of trash unfit for anyone to read !
1,"I admit I gave up on this movie after about 50 minutes. But up to that point the whole ""comedy"" revolved around Dean Martin bullying and shouting at Jerry Lewis, for no obvious reason. I am a life-long Jerry Lewis fan, I adore many of his movies, but not this one. It is pointless tripe. I never thought I'd give up on a Jerry Lewis movie, without watching it all the way through. But after 50 minutes, I felt like shouting back at Dean Martin for his odious carry on in this film. Whoever wrote the script doesn't know the first thing about humour. What a tedious movie!!!!"
2,"The book tells of a time when the primary contact was person to person, with the family of Jim The Boy teaching him what he must learn in life. The era was before television, cell phones, ipods, PC's, texting, etc. Raised by his mother and three uncles they as a unit put their arms this boy to raise him into manhood, which on occasion involved the saying of No and punishment, but always with a point to make. I look forward to reading the sequel of Jim's march into adolescence."
2,"There is no mistaking that this is Trigun. You can just see Vash and the gang of goodies and baddies in action. Definitely has some very catchy tunes. It also has some very odd pieces that just seems to fill in air space. The last number is strangely monotonous without any melody to it, which kind of disapponts. You'd expect it to be something memorable rather than an odd droning noise that seemed to go on far too long. But, it's worth it for the good titles, which far outnumber the non-good ones."
1,"Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised."
2,"I loved this book! Once I started it, I could not put it down. Finally there is a story that's written so well it gives the reader an accurate glimpse of what it is like to climb mountains. I've climbed many, but after reading this I'm not sure I want to go to Denali...brrrrrr. In places the writing is so good I'll admit to feeling chilled myself."
1,I ordered this product a week ago and I have not recieved it yet. I don't know where it is. My credit card has been charged and their has been no tea as of yet on my doorstep. I am not happy. I go to the tracking site and it can't even tell me where it is. I don't see a number anywhere to call. I fear I've been duped.
2,"I saw the movie yesterday and I think it's was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I'm a to since I didn't grab that great song ""You've Got A Friend In Me"", the first time around! THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO FUNNY I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT. It's so cleverly written and so inventive! The soundtrack should only be the same."
2,If you read only one peice of American literature this should be it. Whitman is a true Amercian. He feels the way we feel and he has seen the things we see. No matter who you are you will you think that he has read your mind...only in no so modern english.
2,"Witch of Blackbird Pond By... Elizabeth George Spear The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a fantastic book! Elizabeth George Spear wrote it, and in my opinion she did a wonderful job of it too. I would recommened this book to any fourth or fifth grader. It is a wonderful mix of facts and romance. It is great for class read-alouds and something for the entire family to enjoy. It has won several Newberry awards. I would say it is a wonderful book for any class."
1,"Do not waste your money on this set! After an hour I had worn the smallest drill bit in the set down to a nub trying to drill through a small transmission bolt on my Pontiac Sunfire. I did get the screw extracted, however, the set was worthless by the time I got the screw out. Also, the extractors are weak. One will need a small torch to heat up the metal to loosen screws and bolts to keep from snapping the extractors."
1,I have purchased this perfume for years at Macy's. The perfume sent to me had the packaging and it appeared to be Dazzling Silver; however either the bottle was refilled with something that would make you ill or it was 40 years old. The vendor did not respond to my complaints or agree to refund my money. I would never order from these people again.
2,"Somewhere out there on this Earth, there are three other equally well-made chargers I've misplaced. Until I stop losing these illusive chargers, I will continue to buy them to feed my photographic addiction."
2,"Oasis is by far the best band in existence today and this album proves it. With all the junk bands around today like Third Eye Blind, NSync, and Metallica it's good to know that there is at least one band around that is truly dedicated to rock and roll. It's too bad that Oasis has had such mediocre success in the U.S. I just can't stand to listen to the radio anymore. I can't name even one good band in the U.S. It seems to me that all the best music is made in Europe. Great bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and now Oasis have all come out of Europe. Well enough with my ramblings. If you want a cd that will stick to your cd player indefinitely buy Definitely Maybe."
2,"Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand."
2,WOW....I can't believe how much my cats love this cardboard scratcher. I have one kitty that sleeps on it all the time. I send them to Finland and my son's cat sharpens it's claws and sleeps on it and thats without the catnip. The kitty shreds it until theres a hole in the middle (takes about 3 months)and then hides in the hole! (At least he thinks he's hiding) His cat uses the refills flat on the floor.
2,"Forget those bad critics' reviews. This cd is awesome. It's trendy without being too overly-commercial. The songs are great, and for once it's nice to have a pop album out there that's not all about who's sleeping with who and all that stuff. The songs have some powerful meanings behind them and were well chosen. (For example, 'I Will Carry You', 'Shine', 'Measure of a Man', 'When You Say You Love Me' (my personal favorite. :)) It may not show off his voice as much as American Idol did, but considering that he still is more talented than other artist out there and has already more than proven himself on American Idol, it doesn't pose much of a problem. :) I think this cd was well done. Buy it and you won't be disappointed."
2,"While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"
1,"Why does it look as though the same person wrote all seven of the reviews above? Kind of odd, huh?"

2,"This book is an excellent value on the subject of Real Estateinvestment. It is directed to the novice. The contents delineate""Nothing Down Techniques"" involving no cash. The author explainsthat not all debt is bad. Debt is good if it can pay off themortgage and provide a positive cash flow . The book shows how topurchase the ugly house on the street at a low price and sellhigh. Buyers can find great bargains from lists of condemnedhouses. Today, the HUD has many programs directed towardfixing up neighborhoods. There is a website ""Findtheseller.com"".Some perspective investors even leave business cards in vacanthouses to develop leads. Overall, this work is a good investmentif you will implement the recommendations contained, do therequired research and be patient!"
2,"I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."
2,"Who said numbers have to be dull? This book was funny, very funny, when it was first published fifty years ago.It has aged well. It's still funny - and what with Enron and others having ""lied with statitics"", there's a lot that one can learn from this extraordinary little book."
2,"When the 802.11g adapter was first available, I was reluctant to spend the money. I had a wireless B adapter which cost $11 and worked fine.I recently upgraded my system: Apple iMac and Apple airport extreme (802.11N) router, with which I had problems using the B adapter.The TiVo branded adapter is now at the right price for me. Besides, once I installed it, everything worked perfectly. File transfers were expeditious. Everything was easy to configure."
2,"This is one of the best Superhero films ever because is both entertainingbut at the same time, displays a kind of emotional intensity that I'venever seen before in the Batman Series.. it's extremely well producedbut the MVP goes to Christian Bale (who finally gets to really touch 'em all as Batman).He's one of the finest actors of my generation!!"
2,"I ordered these in the Grey color. Just be forewarned, they are much more of a tan/taupe color than the dove-grey I was hoping for-- but they are still super cute and will match anything. They look pretty much like the photo in color.These also feel sturdier than Chucks I've had in the past."
2,This is an excellent product at an outstanding price. It makes laserjet qualty affordable and there should be no question of whether or not it is a good value. I have recommended this to several friends who have already purchased this laser jet printer
1,"This game is ridiculously hard for a game with ""Nickelodeon"" on it. I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play. Spongebob and Tommy let us down. Hard. Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money. I won't be taken in by the ""Nickelodeon"" name again."
2,I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought.
2,Anyone can get into this show. For all ages. It's very addicting and i wish it never ended. Worst part is Chad leaving
2,"Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day."
1,"Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice. The author is just a dog for rightwing politics. The same neonazi neocons who complain about activist judges are themselves promoting their own set in the process. If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."
1,"The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."
1,"Don't waste your money on the Rose Levy Beranbaum Pie and Cake Bibles. She unnecessarily complicates the recipes, and the instructions are not easy to understand. After hours of pains taking effort, the results are quite often NOT GOOD at all. I'm a very experienced cook, and have been disappointed each time I ventured into one of her lengthy and obtuse culinary ordeals."
1,"Every once in a while my wife will get into a video game. Usually its something to do with harry potter or lord of the rings. She wanted to try out ""At worlds end"" for the 360.I told her it would be dumb and stupid, but she insisted. I bought the game on May 22, the day it came out for $65. Its now May 28th and the game is collecting much dust.On my next trip to gamestop this will be a trade in"
2,Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!
1,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves rockets and I thought she would enjoy it. The pump is total junk and could not even pump enough pressure for a single flight before it broke. I spent an hour trying to fix it and the highest I've gotten the rocket to launch is a couple feet! This resulted in my daughter crying and the rocket getting thrown away. Do not buy this one!
2,"received used book purchase 1 day early, very happy about that. book was in great shape. book purchased for gift and recipient was very happy with it."
2,"Billy does it again! Always funny, BC is right on the edge.Wish more of his stage act was available to the U.S. market on DVD."
2,This is a nice trainer but it's noisier than expected. It's also not that convenient to put a bike in and take it out but if you can leave it up somewhere and not switch bikes very often it will work well. Overall we are pleased with it.
2,"It has a very attractive cover. Got the book about a week ago. I have 165 books to read before I get to this one, but since I'm moving to Mexico in a few months, I thought I'd better put it in my library now. Write me in a couple of years and I'll be happy to tell you what I think of it.Regards,Gerald CampBook Collector"
1,This version does not include the gruesome illustrations of the original that still haunt me every once in a while. The book has been controversial because of the uncensored gore and terrifying images. This version is compromised fluffy camping-trip stories.
2,"If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. It is a bit ""off"" but it keeps you watching. A very different movie. Saw this years ago and remembered it. It never comes on cable. I think it is worth a look."
1,Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
2,great to film in 3D optimal image ferso recommend to anyone who likes the film still in HD. . . .
2,"I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
1,"Bought new unit thinking it would work because the one I had stopped working, same model. The unit replaced had life time free service. Since service comes though the telephone line I though plug in and new unit would work. New shows coming on had not started yet but when they aired I thought new unit would record them. When they did not record,TiVo TCD649080 Series 2 80-Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video RecorderI knew something was wrong. This was past 14 days and company would not take it back. Now I have Comcast and I lost my money on a unit never used."
2,"The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book."
1,"It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind."
2,"I loved this book! The photographs are powerful, and you can't find anything even close to their documentary quality anywhere else. The text is also interesting and includes quotes from a variety of people--the author, the hip hop performers themselves, and other scholars."
1,"I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Since there was no choice of size, I assumed one size fits all. Well, unfortunately, one size does not fit all and this drain plug is too small for my drain plug."
1,"I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support"
2,"This is a very good rack once you get it set up. It takes a good 30-45 minutes to set up this rack initially. Once you've done it the first time, subsequent installation will only take 5-10 minutes. This rack doesn't come with anything, all accessories have to be purchased separately; for such an expensive rack, I thought it would have been nice for them to include some extra Velcro straps to tie down your fork or something.The rack itself is very sturdy and I feel my bike is always secured. The rubber feet left no marks on my trunk lid or bumper. I only wish there was a way to lock the bike and rack together."
2,"This is the ultimate book on Bettie Page. This book is for every true Bettie fan. Even contains an introduction from Bettie herself.If you really want to follow the history of legend, this is the ultimate book on Betty Mae Page!"
2,"I borrowed this book from a friend after he simply raved about it, and knowing that I will read practically anything (and am impressed by very little), he was curious to see what I would think of the book. Well I have to say I really loved it. It was written in a very unique style, not too 'modern commercial fiction' but not to 'literary fiction.' Mr. Malfi has a style like a mixture between Stephen King and Ernest Hemingway, and I would certainly recommend this book be read by anyone looking for a brilliant new voice."
2,"This isn't a movie that's afraid to be itself. Working in the same style as the award winning Elephant , Gus Van Sant has made yet another ""silent"" film with very long shots and F@#*ed indie rawk kids. Tho some folks will find it boring or depressing or both? I found it moving and very brave. The kid also makes for a very handsome Kurt Cobain look alike."
2,"This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read."
2,"I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
1,"I don't understand how Clarence Day, a good author, wrote this wretched book. A father should not be that vulgar, and shouldn't treat his wife with that much disrespect. People may find homor in it, but I did not enjoy this"
2,"My title says it all. Love this CD. Khachaturian is a great, great Artist and he always thrills and touches you. You'll love this one."
1,"Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!"
1,"It's all been done before but with talented actors. This movie should only be shown in acting school : ""Bad acting 101"". Totaly unconvincing perfomances all around especially by Emily Hampshire, could that mean bad directing? Don't waste time or money."
1,unable to get any clear signal my apt faces south and near the windows. Antenna totally ineffective
2,"Its cheap compared to other perfumes,yet smells great! What more can you ask for? My brother gave me a bottle for Christmas, since then I refuse to wear any other perfume!"
1,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed. Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in. Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distractionThe premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material. So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day."
2,"Title about sums it up. If you know diddly squat about your wife being pregnant, worth the watch. Probably could find all the info on Wikipedia or something though. I felt it was worth it."
2,"you know you like pop punk. so here you go. yellowcard is my favorite band on this cd, but their are others. Yellowcard rock like no others!"
2,"I received my new wires just in time for the weekend and the new family Toyota Tacoma got some new wires. It took quite a bit of work to remove the throttle body intake tube, in order to get to the front plug wires on the passenger side but it was worth it. The wires fit perfectly. I recommend you clean the throttle body while you have the intake tube off. Having the TB up high makes it easier to clean the butterfly with a sturdy toothbrush."
2,"perfect fit, and wonder why I haven't had one for so long. non clinging, full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort."
1,"I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women."
2,"Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it's a thick book - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e.g. classic Nordic skis or 3-pin tele's. Alpine riders seeking vertical ft look for George Hurchalla's book."
2,"The influence on science fiction is more than apparent, Burroughs delivers a great story. Enjoyed more now as an adult than I did as a child."
2,"I first purchased this book while on a vacation trip exactly 14 years ago (1989); since then I've tried to read it at least once a year. I laugh my way through the book, and the author's courage & zest for life continues to inspire me! I only hope I am able to always view life with the same gusto & joy she had, trials & tribulations notwithstanding. She was quite a remarkable woman."
1,"I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood."
2,"I've been wearing Mackie for about 1 years and I still get compliments on it. Men seem to really love it. I would try to describe the scent, but I'm afraid I really don't know how to do that. I ordered these last two bottles for someone else who admired it on me and wants it for herself and a friend."
1,"It was an illegible **photocopy**. It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original ""Principles of Science"", then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this book.I returned it immediately."
1,"I thought this was a big dissapointment! It is crude beyond ""good taste."" I wish I could return the DVD but I don't have my receipt so I'll just ""trash it!"""
1,We purchased the so called Professional Stability Ball and it has leaked since we received it. The air inlet leaks and make the ball not functional.
2,"If you like your Rock'n'Roll hard,nasty,and dirty this is the band for you. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed!!!!You have to see them live because they put on a Great Show! This band gives hope for the future of Rock'n'Roll."
1,"Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those."
1,"This ""Mug Warmer"" does exactly what it promises. It warms the mug. Not the coffee. The plate never got hot enough to keep my coffee sufficiently warm."
2,"First of all I would like to say that this book deserves A LOT more than just 5 stars. It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"
1,I was excited when I first saw this game. We are always looking for a game for our young children to play. There it just not enough games for young children on x-box. This game was a big disappointment! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing. There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player. It just was NOT FUN!
2,"Immortal is so good. I bought this album today, and this is after my opinion a little better than ""Battles in the north"". I've actually just have ""Sons of norhern darkness"", ""Battles In the north"", and ""At the heart of winter"", but i'm getting Diaboilical and Pure Holocaust this christmas.... I think SOND is the best immortal cd i have right now, but if u like to get chills and get cold over u'r body, this is the cd for you!!!"
2,"I missed this title when it was in theaters. I have learned to appreciate Brad Renfro. Too bad, like Charlie Sheen, he was hooked on drugs but at a younger age."
2,I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers--super sticky and gets the job done in record time.
1,"although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."
2,"I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. I agree with other reviews that environment wasn't deeply described and there weren't any sophisticated characters, but this didn't disturbed me, because the storyline was fast-paced and interesting. I couldn't put this book down before it was over."
1,"Yeah, I'm impressed with everything that those veterans did in the years following the war, but Brokaw seems to focus only (or mostly) on those that became politicians or in government. What about the effects of the war on musicians? or artists? I would have liked to see him expand on his stories more. All in all, I felt obligated to finish the book (my mother raved about it, but then, she is one of ""those generation"") but I wouldn't recommend it or read it again."
2,"Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their ""ideas"" or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged,"" McCrae's ""Bark of the Dogwood,"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"") ""Fahrenheit 451"" took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as ""fiction."" How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."
1,squezing the tube watch out for the back of the tube blowing out and getting goo all on u
2,this was great i got the product earlier then i expected and it was in the exact condition that was stated on amazon. When i go to buy more movies i will deffinitly be going through the same group :D
2,"5 stars = I love it? No, 5 stars is my thanks for the delicate and tasteful, yet powerful and moving manner in which this most tragic moment in our nations history was recorded. LIFE exceeded its own reputation with the content and speedy publication of this chronicle - so we may never forget."
1,"I am not one to be pessimistic or have a bad attitude in any way, but honestly.. I have to say that the first words that come to mind are that this DVD is a joke. With that being said, the one good thing that I can say is that it is at least entertaining and made me laugh. Sadly enough... being from Austin and listening to tons of live music for years, I cannot think honestly of a time when I have seen a worse live music show. Ringo doesn't even play on most of the songs and at least his band covers up, to a degree, his deficits. I will say that it appears that Ringo himself is enjoying it, which I have to give him credit for, but that doesn't mean that others will! When I first saw this DVD, I was really looking forward to actually to see Ringo playing live, not having heard much from him in years. I could go into more critical detail, but would prefer to just think of this DVD as an amusing entertainment experience, but for serious music lovers.. save your money!"
2,"This is what I listen to when I'm in my Adult Contemporary mood. (Well it's Kershaw more often than it is Springsteen) I've heard of all Nik's old 80's albums, and this really makes them sound bad. I mean, of course, songs such as ""The Riddle"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" are better than anything on earth, but this new material is consistently impressive.""Billy"" is instantly likeable, while songs like ""Shine On"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are the slower favourites. ""God Bless"" is the only stinker, while every other song entertains us with cool guitars and songs that really grow on you over time.I guess all I'm trying, to say, it's worth the wait when an artist perfects their art instead of churning out rubbish twice a year."
2,"Learn how to ask the right questions with this excellent book. Dave not only provides a simple approach to a complex subject, he focuses on the critical hazard recognition necessary to eliminate (by design) or control those hazards. His monthly Hazard Information Newsletter keeps the reader up-to-date with each hazard and its control, on a detailed basis as an extension of this book."
1,watch the trailer and you basically have the whole movie.a guy who stumbles around high and mumbles to himself..
2,"Clay is an amazing new artist and this CD proves that he has versatiliy,range, and heart. His voice is so strong and he evokes so much passion into his songs. Also there are songs to fit anyone's mood whether your happy (When you say you love me, perfect day, invisible, shine) or sad ( No more sad songs) or feel in love (measure of a man, run to me, i will carry you). This CD was worth the wait and worth every dollar!"
2,I haven't finished it all but what I've read is reaaly good and helpdul to all worshippers not just leaders
2,"This is a beautiful Blu-ray disc. Photographer Bob Glusic captures stunning time-lapse photography of exceptional picture quality. The scenes are gorgeous, the colors are fantastic. We see changing sunrises and sunsets over magnificent vistas, waterfalls and cascading streams, birds, clouds and stars, waves and beaches, and flowering meadows. Audio choices include narration, just music, or ambient nature sounds. This is a wonderful film that one cannot tire of looking at."
2,"This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an ""assembly required"" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included, so don't buy an extra chair separately!"
2,"These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,"
2,This novel grips your imagination from the very first pages..Kathy Reichs can really write an attention getting story! I love all of her books.
1,"This books sucks. Mind you, there are over 350,000 aspiring actors. The majority of them have been told and rehearsed on how beautiful and talented they are.Only 10 new actors are ""broken in"" each year. This book sucks."
1,"undoubtedly the worst piece of equipment i have ever owned. literally threw it into the street less then twenty minutes ago. the only enjoyable experience was heaving it fifteen feet into the air and watching it splatter in the driveway.paper jams, ink problems and general misery all around.would give this a negative 5 stars if i could."
2,"An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's."
1,I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
2,"Dear Amazonians,I think Clay Aiken is a strong addition to the popular music scene. The combination of his youthful good looks and agile voice make for a great pop musician.On a technical note though, and the reason for my four-star rating, during the song ""When You Say You Love Me,"" we can hear Clay clear his voice at the two minute and forty-three second mark (2:43 on your CD player). This is a minor technicality though that I am sure Clay will overcome with his future releases. All-in-all, I think Clay Aiken is a very talented artist who will only improve with time.Go Clay!Take care,--Daniel"
2,"I'm in the odd group of people who were not that into The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan did Bruce Wayne very well. His Batman however, felt a little generic. It wasn't bad, just far less interesting than his take on Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me. It depends really. What do you like more? Bruce Wayne or Batman?"
1,"There is no artistry is this first endeavor. Some of the lyrics are painfully odd and Aiken's delivery lacks depth, texture, nuance, finesse, and diversity. Yes, he is a guy who can sing, but he is not an interesting singer. He is certainly not original, nor do I get a sense that there is any real emotion behind the delivery. I feel like I'm being sung at rather than sung to. I admit to never being a fan of glory noting brand of singing, and Aiken only solidifies that conviction.I didn't find him interesting on AI and he is even less so on this debut. Aiken has proclaimed that he is not an artist, just a guy from a reality show. So far, he's confirmed the limitations of his musical aspirations.As for his sales. Well, McDonalds sells alot of burgers... that doesn't make the burgers any better quality. Nothing's wrong with those who enjoy a fast food burger, please enjoy, but don't insist it's filet mignon."
2,"There is no plot to this book. The words are simple (usually no longer than five letters) and the illustrations are full of color and vitality. Basically, children from all different cultures express what they like in the world by saying, ""I love you, ___ (fill in the blank). For example, ""I love you, fish""; ""I love you, sun"". The book, though as infantile as it is, has a subtle message about caring for others and the environment. Infants and young toddlers seem to enjoy this book, but I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone over the age of two."
1,"i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a ""classic"" but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."
1,"A note of caution regarding this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import dvd under any circumstances. In an act of artistic mutilation, the pivotal and brief, chaste yet joyful nude dance scene featuring Manon is prudishly obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (though we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it. BTW, my rating applies only to the Korean import, other versions (dvd or vhs) get five stars."
1,"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."
2,"If you deal with ANGER in your life, and who doesn't, this workbook (self-directed study on anger) is for YOU!There are many helpful hints and thoughts, and although they are given in the context of Christianity, I believe almost anyone can benefit.For those on a 12-step program, you will not believe how closely anger and addiction are related. Do yourself a favor and get (and read) this book!"
1,"To those of you first hearing the j's you might actually like this record. But to those of you who like the previous intelligent hip hop stylings of return of the new and improved, sing earthboy sing, and supermercado you might find yourself staring at your cd player thinking what is this? I had a promo of this record last year before they switched labels and i didn't really like it back then but i figured when the new version comes out maybe it will be better..sadly i was very let down. It's almost like they are a completly new band. More alternative sugar ray/gimmicky radio songs instead of hip hop. I think the fact that they lost amays and andy action had something to do with it but i could be wrong. if your a j's fan who knows you might like it. if this is your first time definatly pick up supermercado first"
2,"I'm not a huge fan of Elton John, but I loved this CD! I was hoping for more of the music from the movie itself, especially the Kline/Branagh version of ""It's Tough to Be A God"", but I was very happy with what I got. I do hope that Dreamworks releases another CD, with more of the score and the Kline/Branagh song, but I'm still very happy with this cd."
1,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
1,"This item has a number of issues, admitted on the site of HP and other forums.They vary from paper feed issues, to connection and hardware conflicts.I have experienced the printer working without problems for 3 months then suddenly with no hardward or software changes the printer stopped.I got it working again for a short period however there appears to be faults in the actual software from HP.If you want a hassle free printer that is reliable don't buy this one.When it works it is very impressive but when it goes wrong, you'll be regretting the day you brought it.Im sure there are plently of people that have this printer and have had no problems at all, however if you do your research there are an awful number of people that do have problems with it.Make your own mind up but check other sites/forums for reviews as well as here."
2,"Product very good, I am of Venezuela the exelente product thanks(Producto muy buenos, soy de venezuela el producto exelente gracias)"
2,"I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection. Happy Gooves...."
2,"""Motor City Moments"" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, ""Don't Git Sassy"" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune ""For Somoeone I Love,"" where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like ""The Love Theme from Spartacus."" Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone."
2,"All of Napoleon Hill's books are a ""must read""! This one as well as Think and Grow Rich, which is the ""un-disputed champ"" of success books! I love all of his books, period! END"
1,this toy is not well made it dosen't stay together. When the child plays with it the tower comes off the base. It is altogether not thought out I would not recomend or buy this toy again.
2,"This is made very well at a great price.I purchased this pitcher specifically to use for my pour over coffee brewing.The spout is great and gives you good control.After the water is poured through i use a frother and make a great cap.The only thing missing is measuring lines for fluid ounces, but one can estimate."
1,"I like these diapers, however, my son gets severe diaper rash with the pampers brand so we use Huggies and there is no rash. The best Huggies are the supremes, worth every extra penny."
1,"I was excited about this dvd given the quality of other Nova productions but that faded fast once I started watching it. The dvd spends most of the hour on a native Indian and how he uses the art of sand painting to express his view of the world. This was not what I expected. There were parts however, that did get into how the eye works and how there are 4 sections of the brain used for seeing (the 4 parts are form, shape, color, and movement) and somehow the brain presents us with a unified experience of all these processes. Also, how the same neuro-pathways we use for imagining an object and actually seeing it are the same. I really enjoyed those parts yet so much time was spent on the subjective evaluations of how this Indian sees the world that I considered it a waste of time. The ratio was about 20 minutes on vision / brain activity and 40 minutes on this Indian's view of the world. Very disappointing indeed."
1,"As a US fan, I was certainly irritated that this was not released in the US and that I had to pay $23 for it as an import. This irritation was compounded when I sat down and listened to the album. This is not a bad album, for most bands it would be a solid effort, but I expect more from Sloan. What this album lacks is variety and subtlety. Most of the songs are just a little too straightforward. Other reviewers have commented on the repetitive guitar riffs and lyrics, and I agree.If you are big Sloan fan, you will probably want this, otherwise its a coin toss."
1,"It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels."
2,"I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it.First thing I can say is that this album is one of the best albums in the world!All the songs are great and I cannot spend a day without listening to it.Shirley's vocal performance is perfect as usual!After listening to Garbage's albums the other albums don't give me the same pleasure.GARBAGE is surely the best band in the universe for me and the members are really great people!I'm sure they will continue their success with their 3rd Album and if I was going to a deserted island, one of the 3 things that I'd take would be VERSION 2.0 (the others would be the batteries and my CD player for listening to it :))"
2,It`s hillarous and it`s got great music.I saw it 3 times and i want to see it again.
2,"I bought this because I didn't want to fiddle around with uncompatible third party wifi adapters. It plugs-n-plays and configures easily. I was up and running with my Tivo in 5 minutes. I also want to complement Amazon. The first shipment was stolen from my front porch, Amazon sent another one no questions asked. $40+free priority shipping+no tax is a Win in my books!"
1,I'have had this K&N; in my car for over 4 years. Yes it does increase gas mileage but it also ruined my MAF sensor after about 4 years. I did try cleaning it w/ MAF sensor cleaner which helped temporarly but i ended up getting a new MAF.I'll probably go with a high flow filter w/out oil next time.joe
1,None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
2,Prompt and in good condition. My 4 year old grand niece loved the book so much she took it to bed with her.
1,"These shoes look great. They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays. The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet. The soles are too flat. When I tried running in them, my heels began to hurt. Walking wise, they aren't the most comfortable to say the least. They are also heavy for what they are. Too expensive for what they are. These shoes are probably bad for your back because they don't absorb any impact. Personally, I don't recommend them for anyone."
2,"I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book."
2,"I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have."
1,"Terrible diapers. We normally buy the cruisers and I accidentally purchased the baby dry diapers. The diapers continually leak! Even when they have been worn for short periods of time, they really can only hold a small amount of urine if your child is at all mobile."
2,These books are the best. My kids all under 5 love them. They are so easy to understand that you don't need to be there to explain or read what they are looking for it shoes the picture for them. I'm defiantly going to buy more.
1,"First let me start by saying that clay was y favorite American Idol, I thoght, and still think, that he should have beat Ruben, Now he very well could have been a member of the bubble gum band N Sync .the One Star is for clays great voice, the lack of the other 4 stars is for his giving into that teeny bopper sound."
2,"I anticipated this CD for so long. I began to fear that I might be let down, and ""Harmonium"" would just be 'just another album.' Oh but it's not, it's definately not.Vanessa blessed us with 11 tracks this time around. The first single ""White Houses"" is simply an amazing track. It's had huge success on radio from Hot Adult Contemporary formats, to Popular Top 40. The video was also very cool, Vanessa showcases her talents in dancing on the video.Other great songs on the album are, well, check the tracklisting. I can't pick out one song that I don't like. Their all unique and original.The other great benefit of this album, is the ""Pleased To Meet You"" documentary as an enhanced feature of the CD. It's a fairly lengthy video filled with Vanessa's thoughts on the record, plenty of live material, and more.5 Stars, definately worth every penny. You won't get tired of this CD."
2,"Great film with two great actors. Funny, witty, charming. Allows you to see that although education may make you smarter, it doesn't necessarily make you better."
1,"The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much. I am about average hieght 5 6"" and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature. My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit didn't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked."
2,The book was good. Kept my interest. In no way am I finished reading it. It isn't a book to read from front to back. The information on each herb is detailed. Great reference material. It was a good addition.
1,"I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER"
1,"This flatware set is very pretty, but made very cheap. After several months of use, the ends became loose and several of them actually fell out. A complete and total waste of money."
1,"This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."
2,"This is the autobiography of a school teacher in Northern Kentucky, he comes across different obstacles some of those 2 churchs that have divided the county almost like opposing armies, violent students and many other problems. Be he still runs a successful country school.""The Needles Eye That Does Supply'""The Thread That Runs So True!"""
2,We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework. It was not to disappoint. The desk is perfect size for her to sit and work. Very high quality and easy to put together. I would highly recommend this product to others?
2,"I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
1,"This movie is bad, Bad, BAD! Makes Rudy Ray Moore look like Fellini!Essentially, this is the crude ""story"" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Problem is: outrageously bad acting, corny ""humor,"" strong and unecessary reverse racism (the lone geeky White character is constantly referred to as a ""cracker,"") vile sexism, unappealing characters. etc. etc.Get this video only if your fireplace runs low this winter."
2,"I read this book in the fifth grade after my teacher, Mrs. Scarpetti raved about it. I am now in my fifties and smile every time I remember this wonderful story!!"
1,"I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
2,In the beginning of the book I thought that she was going into too much detail describing every scene to the tee. But let me tell you nothing would have prepared me for what happened in this book. It was full of surprizes however one thing was apparent if you know how to read into things. My suggestion is get the book! Read it for yourself and laugh to you cry. As another reader said relationships are full of surprizes!
1,"The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new. I got it in the mail after about 2 weeks (from Japan), and it had scratches all over it. I would not buy from this seller again."
2,"Great historical reference text full of recipes for food (some of which we would now consider very odd), ways to clean things, sermons on morality, and other tidbits by a woman who was very progressive in her era."
2,"I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read ""Diary of a Madman"", ""The Nose"", and ""The Overcoat"". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."
2,Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
2,"So often we see in westerns the stagecoach roaring into town and well-dressed easterners get out--not even dusty. This book shows the real and extremely difficult days of the stagecoach mail delivery and does it in a very factual, well-documented way. The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities. It was especially interesting to me since my father and brother have the same name--Ben Holladay. He may be a distant relative and we would be proud to claim him."
1,"I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product."
1,A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at.
1,"This is another movie in the long line of movies trying to shove homosexuality down our throats. Conveniently they don't mention the premis anywhere, making it look like a normal movie that you might like to rent. If you have any morals at all, don't waste your money on the gay agenda."
1,I will never again buy an Eric Flint book without physically examining it. The two official reviews above make it look like a sequel; it is not.
2,"I found the chapters on riding in traffic to be invaluable. I commute to work every day, and ride recreationally on weekends. The lessons in these chapters will save you literally thousands of miles of trial and error, and could save your life. It is a 'must read' for anyone who wants to expand beyond being a casual cyclist, and wants to use their bicycle as an effective means of personal transportation"
1,"Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
2,"This book was given to me two years ago when I suffered a miscarriage. I struggled for several months, while this book gathered dust on my nightstand. I eventually picked it up and worked through it as a devotional. Some days it was hard to read, it left me feeling like the hurt was fresh all over again. But by the end, I felt comfort and peace. I recommend this book to anyone that has suffered a miscarriage or any loss of a child. It is the first thing I recommend to someone who is in search of some healing."
2,"No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me...."
2,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
1,The price was great for my twin grandsons. After a month both babies developed a severe rash from the baby dry diapers. Other Mom's have said the same thing. Now they have switched to Huggies.
1,"Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem. The music is not too bad, but Grishnak deserves no attention for his deeds."
2,"Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
1,"If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc."
2,I first heard Sue Bender on NPR talking about her Amish experience...I was enthralled with it. Later I found the book and read it start to finish in one sitting. As I read it I kept thinking I wanted to buy a copy for all my friends.
2,Same product we always have used. Larger box is nice to get an entire month out of. Autoship and low pricing makes amazon a no brainer.
2,"After I heard Cheatin' from the Shaft soundtrack, I couldn't wait for Liberty City album to drop. This group has talent! The song line-up on this album is very good and the way their voices harmoniously flow togehter makes for a smooth and easy sound."
1,"The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
1,"Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see."
1,"LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
1,"After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy."
1,"The brush is stiff, I guess you get used to it. It has a long handle, compared to a hair bush? The handle is smooth and you cannot grip it when you are in the shower. It is anything but ergonomic. I guess you take a dry bath. Do not buy this brush unless you are needing to bristle off some very caked on dry skin or rust and can use a grinder to make the handle gripable. What a waste of good money."
2,"I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.The Series:1- BATMAN BEGINS2- BATMAN3- BATMAN RETURNS4- BATMAN FOREVER5- BATMAN & ROBIN"
1,"I was disappointed in this toy. It was a travel size and I was expecting a bigger size. I had seen the larger version and was really looking forward to giving it to my daughter. As is turns out, she was a little scared of it anyway, so she probably would have really been scared of the larger one. Anyway, it is a great toy, but I would prefer the larger version."
2,"I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, ""uprising"". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!"
1,"This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression. In any case, everybody's moved over to the American model, so Orwell's scrawlings would do well to stick around on their crusty little island."
1,"Could Water Bearer Films have found a print in worse condition? With weaker, more faded color? There is a note on the back cover that the ""Digital color enhancement"" has been copyrighted - that's enhancement? And on top of it all it looks like a poor copy of a VHS tape. The wretched quality of the picture... and the sound as well... make the DVD virtually unwatchable. A 1968 film shouldn't look as bad as this. I guess we're just supposed to be grateful that the film is available on DVD - thanks, but no thanks, Water Bearer."
2,"The book, although hard to get excited about in the begining, offers insight into confrontations that you experience any given day during your life. It's thorough and offers helpful ideas."
2,"Great movie, however DVD does not have any features. I am not sure if it worth to pay for the price, maybe wait till you can get it on sale."
2,"All the wonderful voices and Menotti's staging and the incomparable music that has stayed in my head for 50 years are here. I cried in all the familiar moments. The video is so old that in places it looks like animation, but the atmosphere still comes across. Great special features with inside dope on the first production."
1,"If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending."
1,"The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to ""System of a Down"" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage."
2,"I have a VERY picky 4 month old who refuses to eat using any kind of nipple other than these. These are what they started him on in the hospital and although they are supposed to be disposable, we have been able to use nothing else since (despite numerous purchases of other brands to try with him.)"
2,"Almost 30 years ago, my Dad bought me the entire series. I read through ""A Princess of Mars"" (my first novel) in three days at the age of 10. I read of the wonderful, fantastic adventures of John Carter, and was hooked--not just on Edgar Rice Burroughs, but also on science fiction, science, and, most importantly, reading.These books are not grandiose intellectual tomes. They are just pure fun! And that pure fun will inspire kids brought up with video games and Pokemon to go back to the basics and learn the joys of reading.Other reviews mention the need to get the second and third books in the series. I recommend you get them all. You'll never be satisfied until you're through them all, and then you'll be disappointed there are no more."
2,"This was a great deal at the time for #3 size diapers with free shipping until I became a bargain shopper. Costco has a better deal IF you look at the whole picture (per diaper price). Do your home work parents! We like the ""Baby Dry"" type because it really holds the ""stuff"" in."
1,"When this movie first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. The plot was silly and Brando's acting was awful."
1,"Ewww last night on Billboard Awards, Clay was doing that gross eye-flutter thing again! Ick! I bet he was pretty sad when Beyonce beat him out for Female Artist Of The Year. This CD is horrible and so is Ruben's. American Idol stinks. Listen to the Foo Fighters instead, you will be much happier."
2,"Clay Aikens debut cd is beyond outstanding. Each and every song you can feel him sing, as if he was singing to you. He is 100% talented even more so then i a true clay fan even though. The songs Perfect day and Measure of a Man combine true vocal talent and true writing talent to make perfection. There is not a single song on the cd that is skip worthy. It is amazing and Clay truly proved even though he might not be made for stardom he is talented and i would listen to him sing the alphabet because he is amazing!"
2,"When I ordered this book, I expected a book which would be overly simple in explanations and not very much depth. I was pleasantly surprised by its content. The book is very easy to understand and very readable. Some of the subjects I found a little boring, but that is to be expected in most books. Overall I thought this book captured my attention and helped me look at certain aspects of mathematics in a new manner. I enjoyed most chapters , but especially the topic of topology. Very easy to understand the basics thanks to explanations. I wholeheartedly encourage reading this book."
1,"I know that ""Herland"" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend ""Herland"" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at ""social housekeeping"" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."
2,"""Almayer's Folly"" adequately introduces the theme of culture conflict, an angle that is expressed more fully in Conrad's later works. I would certainly recommend this to anyone familiar with Conrad's body of work, which is not to say that readers new to his work should avoid this novel."
1,"I like Clay and bought the cd, but save your money and download the songs from the show, they are MUCH better. He is so good and this cd is so bad. What happened? Just a rush to get it out? You have the talent, just pick better songs next time."
1,"I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON"
2,"TIVO locked upon install, but chatted with tech support and they provided me a code to get it unlocked. Other than that, operates well, no complaints. Would recommend if you want to have a TIVO set up without having a bunch of ethernet cables ran to it. Can attest that this DOES work with TIVO HD Premiere!! Don't spend extra on the 'G' unless you absolutely want to, this works just fine!!!"
2,"Although many people prefer Morning Glory, this is my favourite Oasis album. I love the heavy, and to me very interesting production. The layered guitars, sound effects, keyboards and percussion create a marvellously powerful 'wall of sound'. I like all the songs on this record but the highlights for me are Do You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Don't Go Away and the magestic All Around the World. The songs on this album may seem very long and can be quite boring at first. But this is an album that should be listened to. It's fantastic to hear it all and focus on all the parts. It's an album that should be got and should be really listened to."
2,"My baby has sensitive skin, We try most of the product in the market and never found any of them delivered to the promise including Pamper baby dry thin. Finally we stick to this one and seems to be OK for my baby except few small rashes my baby is comfortable with this one"
2,"I purchased this as an extra battery for a Canon sd800is. It is the same as the original battery and is Canon ""branded"". A third party battery is available locally at TWICE the price, and the Canon version for almost three times the price. This is a good buy."
1,"I wish I could give this product no stars.I bought this stuff from a local health store and used it as directed. The product boasts a higher content of salicylic acid than other products. When I applied the product I was expecting it to burn. However, I never felt a thing. It's doesn't go on very smooth either (it's not like lip balm) and seems to cake up. I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger. I saw no noticeable change other than that. It was a waste of money for me. When I went back to the health store to tell the guy about the product, they had already stopped selling it because of complaints of it not working. Oh well."
1,The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product.
2,"I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs."
1,"Of Mice and MenI didn't like the book at all. The only thing that I actually liked about the book was the character Lennie. I thought that they described his characteristics very well. The author described the way Lennie acted so well, that when u were reading the book it was like u could hear his voice. I didn't like the way the story was written, because that isn't really my type of book. I think the reason I didn't really like the book is because I don't really like reading that much, so that probably had an effect on the way I looked at the book after I was done reading it. I wouldn't really recommend this book to someone."
1,"The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)"
1,"There is no other way to put it. All Visioneers are garbage. Purchased my 2nd one (after first one died for no reason after a year) and have experienced many problems. Lately it won't let me scan anything because of an error saying to ""unlock your scanner"". There is no Freakin lock on the darn thing!!! After contacting the company many many times (btw - there customer service sucks! - No telephone number, unless u pay $2 per minute, just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA). I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau, there response was that they couldn't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase, but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25% off of their price (which was probably an elevated price). I told them to kiss off! Anyway - please don't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck!"
1,"I received two of this brand of mug warmer. I only ordered one, but I finally resolved the issue with Ace Hardware.I love this Mr. Coffee mug warmer. I have one at work and one at home. I don't throw away coffee like I did before, because the mug warmer does keep the drink warm. I am pleased."
2,"This collection is absolutely hilarious and more than a must for any Simpsons-enthusiast. It contains Bart the Daredevil - Itchy, Scratchy and Marge - Two cars in every garage and 3 eyes on every fish [Blinky] - Bart vs. Thanksgiving - Tree House of Horror - Bart gets an F. Bart sez: Ay Carumba - Get it man or eat my shorts!"
1,"Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. Has many cool features, TV-out,dual moniter etc.Bad parts: my computer is 5 years old with a really crummy vid card, and i play a lot of online games with it. They usually run 20 or 30 frames per second, which is barable but i could do better. so i went to comp usa and the guy told me to get this one because it was plenty fast. I installed evrything properly but even after tweaking and adjusting to the max all i could get was 12 fps. This card was so useless i exchanged it for a PNY technologys Verto geforce 4 ti 4400 card, which rocks btw....rocks hard."
1,You get what you pay for. The plastic is cheaply made and the eggs practically need a crowbar for pulling apart. Don't waste your $ even if it is inexpensive!My 12 month old lost interest in a minute.
1,I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
1,"I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
1,"For those who, like me, have found great pleasure in surrounding oneself with great literary works, the Easton Press edition books seem to have a lot of draw. However, it has been my experience that many of their novels by foreign authors can be found to contain older and flawed translations.This specific Easton Press contains the Mercier 1873 translation that edits out 25% of the original text. The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century. Happy reading.Peace, Ben"
2,"If you liked Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, or Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Then you will most likely enjoy this film. The plot was... different. I enjoyed it but it seemed to go by fast.Stars: *****"
2,"This movie is based loosely on the true story of France Mayes. It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery. All of the characters are perfect!I also stumbled on to a daily planner based on the story... filled with gorgeous pics and quotes, stories, and recipes from Frances. So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!"
2,I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
2,"Had this one on vinyl back then. These girls know what rock and roll is! This IS HEART at their best [in the 80's].Not only the 5 singles on this album make it awesome but, the other songs are very good! I can tell by other critics that they must expect perfection consistently. Well man, it's ROCK AND ROLL and it's ""HEART"". Just one of the best in the business! They need NO critics! My opinion is that this album ROCKS! It's one of the girls best. LOVE YA GIRLS!ROCK ON! P.S. CAN'T GO WRONG HERE."
2,"Rainbow's End is a thrilling novel by Bob Adamov that connects a shady raid during the American Civil War with modern-day black ops machinations and clandestine schemes. An active and attention gripping saga, Rainbow's End is peppered with remorseless murder, sailing, danger, deadly chases, and much more. Rainbow's End is highly recommended as an adventurous story of how greed twists human nature and the hidden depths of strength that lie beneath the surface."
1,"I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!"
1,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine, although i wanted to watch it as well. From the description of the movie i thought it would be entertaining and funny. Well the movie was pretty cheesy to say the least. The special effects were not good at all, the plot was thin (what can you expect from a gay vampire movie?). There was one hot scene in the movie. Other than that it was just not something i would want to watch again. Have a bunch of friends over for drinks and watch it, that would be entertaining!"
2,"I just love this book. It's really amazing. I read Gail Howard's columns in lottery magazines. I know she has had many ""lottery"" winners using her books, but I think this book is the best of all of them. I can't rave enough."
1,"Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
2,"A co-worker kept saying how great this CD was and how great Clay's voice was and that I would not regret buying this one, and she was so right. What a talent this young man is! I just can't listen to it enough.. Although its hard to pick a favorite out of all the awesome songs, I would have to say track #10 ""Perfect Day"" is my favorite. But you will find yourself singing along with all of them. Great job on a debut CD. Clay Aiken's voice is phenomenal, and he is what today's music needs."
2,This was purchased for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Keeps her tea and hot coco warm for her as she sits in her recliner and reads or watches TV.
2,"After listenting to this CD since 10/14/03 numerous times daily---I enjoy each song every time I listen to the CD. ""The Way"" ""Run to Me"" ""Shine"" ""Touch"" are my front runners right now but I enjoy all the songs. Why is Clay so intesting--his eyes, his mouth and his incredible voice!! Can the guy sing-YES! I saw Clay in concert during the AI tour--he has that quality that comes out and WOWS the crowd and holds you thru each and every performance and he has done the same with his first CD! I will continue buying his music because of his wonderful qualities!!!You go CLAY! And if you have not heard him sing ""Noel"" on the Holiday CD you are missing probably the best verison of the song I have ever heard!!! Makes you want to stand up and shout to the heavens!Clay measures up in every way as a true entertainer in every way possible!"
2,"I often buy Cds. In almost all cases I will skip over a few songs that don't appeal to me. This is the first cd in a very long time that I can actually say I like all of them. Even though this cd is considered all ""pop"" it has a continuity to it that doesn't happen very often. Each track is unique. There is an easy flow within this album,yet you get the feeling that each song is different.I honestly can't tell you which song I like best.....I think that is a matter of personal opinion. For a debut album I feel this one will appeal to many for various reasons. I don't think you will be disappointed ...."
1,"The one time I attempted to watch this concert was immediately after watching ""Miracle"" by the 12 Girls Band (both concerts were on the same DVD for some odd reason). I was able to sit through only a few pieces before having to eject the DVD. While ""Miracle"" showed the 12 Girls Band to be a class act exhibiting skillful musicianship, elegance and femininity, Bond came across like some goofy teenage girls lacking class, elegance and femininity. OK, so they are skillful musicians; not good enough."
1,"Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."
1,"We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the ""blowouts"" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed. Don't try Kroger or Kmart brands or anything similar just Target. Only if someone told us this a year ago we'd have a Ferrari by now with all the money we saved after switching!"
1,"2 big complaints:1. great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes. No story to follow.2. Dumb girl, ""eek!"" Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines. Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she. She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart. Give her something! Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.One small complaint:The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal."
1,"I give up. I can't take it anymore. It's just the same old bit, over and over and over again. Disney wants to sell some new-age, sentimental, genderless, ahistorical fairy-tale ripoff and they have John come up with the sappy soundtrack so that he can parade himself around at benefit dinners for another year or so until the next Disney assignment. Please, for the sake of humanity, desist!"
2,"When I first heard this CD, I loved it from the get go. The music is very hypnotic, while at the same time it infuses you with a lightening bolt of high powered trance trip'n. This makes an excellent medium for visualization (the internal kind, not the video kind), meditation, and just trancing out. Oh yeah, and dance. Dance, dance, and dance to this badboy. Even at 56 years old, I can feel the electric current going through me like I was made of copper. Did I mention it's downright sensuous too...oooeee baby, it sure'nuff is."
2,I love this slip. I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely.
2,"I like haunted house movies and this film is no exception. Yes, it is a ""reimaging"" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I'm also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort."
1,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I have never EVER been soooooooo BORED in all my life! I found myself talking out loud to my television screen, saying things like...""JUST BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT ALREADY YOU KURT COBAIN WANNABE! WE ALL KNOW HOW THIS ENDS!""If any of you buyers are curious about this film I'll give you some advice. HIT THE BACK BUTTON ON YOU COMPUTER SCREEN RIGHT NOW AND DON""T LOOK BACK! Don't buy this film, don't even rent this film, hell...don't even steal this film! IT'S THE WORST!"
2,"This was a cute story, although not too original. Easy read. I would read this author again.Classic feel good love story."
2,This book was amazing The way the author made it sad and very exciting. The book made me want to read even more. But why were the adults the only ones to die instead of the kids. The book could've been better and more sad and exciting.
2,"If your going to buy this CD, I can tell you right now the best song on here is Devil's Night. Its just wicked. Theres only 4 songs on this CD and Devil's Night. He's got some sampling of Beastie Boys kinda like in Kkkill The Fetus. This is a great Esham album all in all. But its worth to have in particular because its got Devil's Night."
2,"I purchased the Cd today, I listen to it 6 times, it is a great cd, I was surprised at his sound and the type of music he chose for the cd... Great selection and mix of music... I believe this will be a hit for him... I like cuts Number 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,and 11. Great going Clay...."
1,"Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book."
1,Maybe my expectations are too high but after reading the reviews I expected more. I thought the plot was too unrealistic for me to even be interested in. I liked the characters but I found myself flipping through pages just to get through the book.
2,"If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
2,"The is the very first book that I have read by Alan Cook. The book started off slow but didn't remain that way. It was a good fun read. I had issues at certain parts. 1)Tony is a mid 30's male that sometimes is lusting after a soon to be 18 years old female. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even though their relationship was platonic, her mother not knowing him pretty much allowed him to have free rein with her. 2) What appears to me to be the gratuitous reference to 911. 3) Having a character who has never spoken with, had history or experience with the ""nanny"" in this story allude to a nanny in California being a Spanish speaker. Not all nannies are Spanish speakers. Not all nannies speak Spanish. These are a few of the instances where I shook my head.Overall it's not a bad book. It was fun. I plan to read more by Alan Cook."
2,"This is a wonderful first effort from Camika Spencer. Drama, however, is a perfect word to describe it. I thought the ideas were set on a great stage of characters, personalities and situations. We were able to follow our main character (Greg) throughout some very difficult and stressful times in his life. I absolutely love the interaction between Greg, his friends, his family, and his coworkers. The character development was absolutely great. There weren't too many that we were confused of who was who or what aura they possessed. I was quite pleased with the book. It was a fairly easy read and there was just enough suspense to keep you looking for the plot and the outcome. Personally, I was pleased to be able to follow Greg as he matured in this situation. I would much rather find my characters changed and mature at the end of a novel, than falling into the same scenarios. Ms. Spencer has done an excellent job with her premier novel. I look forward to more of her work."
2,"This book is very nice and it should be a full 5 stars with out a question, its a very interesting story about this retard (literally) who falls in love and gets in trouble while his friend has to always get him out of it...and it ends tragically...."
1,"Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two ""bland"" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.I thought it was about time someone mentions these points."
2,"At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40."
2,"sure this is a cheap stand BUT if you just want something to hold your bike from falling over and/or you want to have it around for quick drivetrain adjustments (if you set it just so, you can turn the cranks without hitting the stand) it more than does the job. If you're doing a major overhaul you probably want a real workstand but this is an awful handy thing to have around.I've used it more than once to work on a bike with the rear wheel out and/or adjust a derailleur that was a little out of whack, replacing cables, etc. etc. etc. You can't work on the front wheel with this stand, but that's not what it's designed for."
2,"Yes, this isn't the best space heater I have ever owned, but it has a unique shape where it doesn't gather a bunch of dust, like past heaters have, and you can't beat the price for its performance."
1,"Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."
1,"Bland, boring, nasal, banal, lyrically bankrupt, musically sophomorish, imitative, empty, hollow, stupid, not worthy of the CD pressing -- let alone comparison to the Beatles. There, I think that covers it."
1,"This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
2,"Great movie from my childhood! Looks great on DVD. I thought it would look like an old movie, but it doesn't."
1,"I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened."
2,"Good story for a movie. In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story. Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."
1,Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
1,"Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste...."
2,Very sturdy and does a good job of holding my flute like it's supposed to. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,"I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!"
1,"Could not get our cat to even think about using it. It just sits there taking up space until I decide to throw it out, or maybe find a neighbor that I could give it away to who has a kitten that could figure out what it's for and use it. But sadly, my older cat won't."
2,"Maybe not as good as ""Black Celebration,"" but still a great album. ""Never Let Me Down Again"" is a classic. ""Strangelove,"" ""Pimpf,"" and ""Behind the Wheel"" are also good tracks. ""The Things You Said"" and ""Little 15"" are kinda brooding but in that unmistakable way that makes Depeche Mode as good as they are. Just another really good album."
1,To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
1,"Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the ""I think I can still write a hit"" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."
2,"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the ""gods"". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."
2,"This is a fantastic first novel. Mary Holt Allen not only captures the attention of her reader, but creates whole characters who carry our attention through their failures and successes. I found myself raging at characters only to fall back in love with them again later. And the story is far reaching and simply lovely. You will be thinking of these people as if they are your friends."
2,"I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over."
2,"I've had this steaming pitcher for a month and it is already rusting, however that can be fixed with the right cleaning product so it doesn't really bother me. This pitcher is really sleek looking and holds 20 ounces if you fill it to the top."
1,"I really disliked this book. I think some of it has to do with the fact that the lines were off on some of the sentences throughout the book which made it more difficult. This is a great story, very imaginative but painful to get through unless you are a marine biologist."
2,"And yes, that's a good thing. Prepare for the words and his wonderful voice meshing together to bring you to an emotional high. Clay music stands out amongst a field of untalented, precocious garbage foisted upon the public.The only small fault I could find is that the studio recordings mask the power and timbre of his live voice. Yet there's not a bad cut on this album.I expect it will be the years best seller. Go Clay!"
1,"the perfume came without outer plastic package, as if it had been opened before :(no date of production, no detail description (like citronelol, eugenol, coumarin etc)the paper pack (the box) was deformedvery disappointing purchase. I ordered another perfume the same time from Perfumania - all the above stated points were ok."
2,This cd is truly worth the wait! I can listen and enjoy each and every song in the CD.Invisible and Measure of the Man are the best!Platinum for Clay !!
1,There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.
1,"I thought this book was the worst book ever. It was so boring! Did I mention that it was the WORST BOOK EVER!!!! It was the worst book in the history of bad books. You should never read it. Take my word on that. Oh, and I didn't just choose to read it on my own. A teacher forced me to read the dumb novel. IT'S THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!"
1,"I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday"
1,Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
1,"Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!"
1,"This was not the greatest generation. This was the last bigoted generation. Bigotry today exists in smaller and smaller pockets, hangovers from the generation Brokaw prostrates himself to. My older friend tells me that she likes working with younger men than her own generation because she gets treated like an equal instead of a subordinate. Says it all really - the greatest generation doesn't even like itself. Is Tom Brokaw out to make a buck with the old `it were better in my time' malarkey, or is he stupid? Given that he is already very wealthy, and has never before struck me as an idiot, I'm going for the only other option - he wanted more limelight. By the way, the book was repetitive. If they were that great, why weren't there more examples to call on than the same schmaltz delivered time and again."
1,"This machine is from hell - save your money.Every tenth brew the cap and filter misalign, causing messy overflow. One overflow leads to another because grounds get into the cap and clog it. Mine is in the trash and cannot be incinerated too soon!"
2,"Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series. Just wish they had the Last and Final book in the Series which was ""Whirlwind"" when I was ready for it."
1,"I recently ordered this camera hoping I could fly my helicopter controlling it at close range. Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera."
2,"Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band ."
1,"I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing."
2,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder)is one of my favourite books of all time. Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5."
1,"If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12"" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7"" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd."
1,It hurts my wrist to slip this on and off. It would have been much better if it had a velco strip or something where you could wrap it around the wrist instead of having to force it on.
1,"basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind."
1,"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."
1,This mug warmer DOES NOT KEEP LIQUID HOT. I purchased this one to replace my old mug warmer that kept coffee at a perfect temperature. This mug warmer barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. Don't waste your time or your money on this product.
2,"This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless."
2,"This book is great for readers learning spanish or english. It has beautiful illustrations, and a great story that is based on an event that most children will have to face. The celebration of the day of the dead brings people closer to those who have passed away, and is a great idea to give to children.Este libro es muy bueno para lectores ms jovenes para aprender ingls o espaol. Tiene dibujos bonitas, y un gran cuento que es sobre un evento que muchos nios tendrn. La celebracin del Dia de los Muertos traiga los personas muy cercas a los personas que son muertos, y es una buena idea dar los nios."
1,"The movie was awful. Not only did the plot not make any sense, the audience really does not sympathize with either of the two main characters. It also was violent for violent's sake. It was all shot in a very unlovable and gritty lighting. The CGIs were unrealistic and distracting.I didn't like the main female character's husky voice. She delivered a poor acting performance. As for the angel, why? why? why? Why the ridiculously cut hair? The characters seemed to be thrown in, all with their slightly different accents or speaking styles. It's a big mess, all glued together at the end, without having thought everything through.Oh, and the cab driver boy was annoying.Ugh! what a junk of a movie. How can rate this less than one star?"
1,"I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."
1,"This novel might be OK for children, but for grown-ups it's an overly idealized (to put it mildly) fantasy of depression-era Southern life. I kept expecting Andy and Opie to come walking in, carrying their fishing poles; at least something funny might have happened, that way. But this earnest, plodding book about an unbelievably good world is actually kind of an insult to the way southern people really lived in the 1930s, black and white. What was the author thinking?"
2,"First book I've read that makes sense / is understandable to normal people. Unlike the usual stupifying fare, felt I could use some of this in the real world. Diagrams were helpful. Definitely a different take on intuition...."
1,"I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several."
1,"Bought this set based on low price and good reviews. Works fine for poking logs occasionally and cleaning up when stove is cold, but while using the shovel in the fire, the black coating started bubbling, then caught fire."
2,"free from amazon, downloaded the free kindle app for a new android phone and was trying it out, have not read the book yet but the pages and quality look good."
1,"I got these last December-05. The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack (right at the L/R labels). They eventually crumbled and fractured, causing the cups to fall off. I taped one side up and the other failed as well. I have no doubt that if I replace these, the same thing will happen. My complaint is for $300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points."
1,"I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like ""see-through"" clear blue plastic. Unfortunately, it looks like its made from some sort of tubberware material.The electronic sounds (2 and not in any sequence),one sounds okay/good, the other sounds like the flushing sound on my daughters potty book. The eyes look like round paper decals and looks...wierd. I'm sure my 6 yr old son would like it, just because its YU-GI-OH, but I'm a fan too and was excited about getting this for him for XMAS......I'm glad I started early, I can return it for something else."
2,"The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's ""war novels"" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern ""sophisticated"" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading ""women's"" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a ""western"" writer; he was so much more than that."
2,This warmer not only keeps beverage warm but also makes the drink hotter than when I poured it. I will get 2 more for the office.
1,"It's not true. when I received the printer, I found that the printer did not have any cartridge. so, I had to buy the cartridge. the information is not true. be careful. I was very upset."
1,"I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book."
2,"This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great."
1,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
2,"Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this book! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this book. He shares with us the importance of disciple-making and how to do it correctly and systematically. He tells us what to look for in a potential disciple and the four progressive steps in the life of a Bible student: a convert, a disciple, a worker, and a leader. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of personal discipleship, this book is for you! Does anyone have his email or snail mail address? If so, please email it to me! Thanks."
1,"Yes, I had to tape my battery hatch shut too. Even then the hatch jiggled the batteries, turning it off and restting the time etc. I had high hopes for the design but the grip put my fingers over buttons that I kept accidentally pressing during runs."
1,"I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed ""The Romanov Prophecy"" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The ""secret"" that Barry's concocted is intended to be ""provocative"" in the model of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."
2,"My daughter (9 years old) asked (and received) this kit for her birthday. After reading the reviews and some complaints about how messy the kit was, I was very nervous to actually do it once we got it. But, while it is a *little* messy, it's not nearly as bad as I was expecting. The food coloring does make it MORE messy - so if you're nervous, start with one of the recipes that doesn't need coloring (or just skip that ingredient! At least for the first batch) She and a friend did this (with my help) and had a blast. They were so proud of their creations and even had fun trying to invent their own names for their gum. The flavor of the gum goes pretty quickly when you're chewing it (and the jury is still out on how well it ""keeps"") but I think all that is secondary to the actual fun in CREATING your own gum. They loved it."
1,"The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn't work properly. While converting: I am getting interference from the unit on both the TV and computer (which shows up on the copy), there is a 1/8 inch distortion at the bottom of the preview screen (also shows up on the copy), and the sound is not in sync. I tried to contact the company by phone and left messages instructed with no call back from them. Sent an email to tech support that went unanswered too. Finally contacted someone at the company, explained my problems, returned the unit as per instructions for repair, received it back after 3 weeks and it still doesn't work. Contacted tec support again and was told to download updated program(I had the latest version installed) did so anyway without any better results. My suggestion is to pass on this unit."
2,"Yes, these boots are comfortable. They soften after a few miles of walking. They keep your feet warm and dry, especially with my smartwool socks. Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere."
1,"I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
1,"As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful"
1,"In reading use comments about Yanni's album ""If I Could Tell You"" I noticed this author advertised his book. Regardless of the book's merits, I think it should be rejected due to the author being a shallow, inappropriate capitalist.PS I'm proud of myself for not swearing at Mr. Mcandrew in this post."
2,"This is a great CD, especially if you like Bluegrass music and Dolly Parton. What a fantastic combination!"
2,I purchased the shoe tree for my Mom for Christmas. She loved it. Its a space saver. It handled 14 pair of shoes no problem.

2,"This award winning documentary was brilliantly produced and directed. But more importantly, Greg's story is a true example of God's redeeming love, grace, healing and mercy. I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken, lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity, and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before, it is even more so now. When I go through difficult times, sometimes his story comes to me and I say, ""There is hope indeed. God will get me through this.This DVD is a powerful tool for evangelizing. Glory to God for His all consuming love that gives us such hope."
2,Not much to say as it is just a stainless steal pitcher. But it is as good as my more expensive pitchers. I normally use the larger pitcher for most my frothing but when someone wants less milk I always grab this one so milk doesn't splatter everywhere while frothing
2,"The evidence is not yet in whether these are doing anything for me, but it is supposed to take up to six months so I am patiently waiting. In the meantime, I can say that the price is right compared to other retail suppliers' formulations and that delivery has been prompt and reliable."
2,"I was very excited to get this cd and I was not dissappointed. Clay is a wonderful singer with a big clear voice with a very good range. What I liked most about this cd is that the songs deliver good messages and no dirt. I would say that this album is a mix of pop rock and inspirational. Some of my favorite songs would be:Invisible- fun, upbeat, and good lyric about not being noticed by the person you are attracted to.The Way- Wonderful, romantic and I expect that it will be played at a number of dances and proms.I Will Carry You- reminds me of the songs Bridge Over Troubled Waters and He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother with its moving and inspirational message.This is the Night- another romantic song that gives me the tingles.Measure of a Man- This song could easily fit in a gospel/inspirational album. Fabulous message in it.This cd makes me go back and forth between dancing and getting teary eyed. I bet you will feel the same way."
2,"I've tried various diaper brands. Pampers beats all of them hands-down. Well worth the miniscule higher price. With other brands, I experienced significantly more leaks/blowouts up the back. Also, they leaked pee around the waistband area. I've never had the leak problem with Pampers. Pampers aren't perfect, but I have far fewer out-and-up-the-back leaks with them and they feel and look like nice, high-quality diapers. The ONLY thing I don't like about them is the ill-placed color pattern at the inner thighs and upper back areas, as it appears at a quick glance that poo is seeping out when it's not! Gets me almost every time!"
2,"This band, made up of two Akronites, will make energy come out of your eyeballs. If you like delta blues, rock n roll, and hype beats, then you will like The Black Keys. They are going on tour and are playing with Jon Spencer's guitarist Judah Bauer. Beware though, their music might kill you because your brains will be destroyed from rock overload."
1,"I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."
2,"I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money."
2,"I read this maybe 20 years ago, and have to read it again. SOOO good, so intense, scary, awesome!! Great plot twist. It should have been a bestseller!!"
2,"George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments."
2,It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks
1,i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness.
1,Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.
1,Great product for my visiting 3 1/2 year old grand daughter! Stays inflated well.Fair price! Easy to inflate and deflate!
1,"This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it. I feel that no one could ever like this book."
2,"The real deal. Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter. Field jacket, liner, and undersweater. 28 degrees and still comfortable. Great investment."
2,i bought for my dad so he doesn't have to sit 3 feet away from the TV while my mom is sleeping. Now he can sit on the bed and lay down with another 5 ft to spare..
2,"I use Baby Dry in size 4 for my 18 month old son. He has yet to have even ONE blow out diaper, even though he has had some tummy issues due to antibiotics. They are comfortable and fit his chunky thighs well. I've never had a leak either, even though he has some pretty full diapers in the morning."
1,"When compared to some of the other wonderful literature that is available for children, this book doesn't have a leg to stand on. It was poorly written and rather boring. (...)"
2,My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
1,"Giving Sarah a lift from Loch Ness to London, the TARDIS picks up a distress signal and the Doctor lands the ship on Zeta Minor, a planet on the very edge of the universe. On this planet, an expedition seeking a new energy source has lost all but one of its members.However, when the Morestran Empire rescue expedition arrives, the Doctor and Sarah are prime suspects as the mysterious killers. But the planet has a very large secret, one which threatens the whole universe...'The Planet of Evil' is one of those Doctor Who serials that so many people seem to love, but which leaves me cold (perhaps not a surprise, as it was written by Louis Marks, who also wrote 'Inferno', which falls into the same category. Novelisation hasn't greatly improved the story in my eyes, and deprives us of the wonderful Zeta Minor jungle set.If you like 'Inferno', you'll probably like this one far more than me."
2,"I saw these guys at Coachella last year and not only do they put on an amazing performance, there studio work is nothin short of superb. This is definitely an album you can put on and listen from track 1 until the very end and get into every minute! All my buddies are hooked!"
2,This musical offering was a superb display of Clay's versatility and powerful range. I keep changing my mind on which song is my favourite. I find myself humming bits of each song when I am alone or walking along the beach. My only regret is that it may take some time before a second album is released and I am already anxiously awaiting that event and will definitely pre-order. Measure of a Man is my all-time favourite cd to listen to and I'm 49 years old so I've listened to a few!
2,"I bought this CD originally when I was in junior high, to accompany me while I practiced my saxophone (I preferred to practice to Beach Boys music over the school fight song). Anyway, it's also good for karaoke. However, be careful listening to the previous reviewer, who either can't count or has a different CD. There are 15 tracks on the CD, which last I checked is *not* over 20."
1,THESE DIAPERS ARE HORRIBLE. I ALWAYS BUY THE PAMPERS CRUISERS BUT SINCE THE STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK I THOUGHT PAMPERS MAKES THESE AS WELL SO THEY MUST BE GOOD AS WELL. WELL I WAS WRONG MY DAUGHTER WEARS THEM FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HER PEE PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPER. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT TO AN HOUR AT LEAST. ONE PEE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE HER DIAPER. HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE PAMPERS MAKES THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DIAPERS!!!
2,The base and the vertical poll are really good quality. The rotating holders are ok. Currently they look great.
2,"Good solid product, built well, good switch and cord. However, I like my tea/coffe HOT, and this keeps it marginally warm enough for me."
1,"Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
2,"This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers"
1,"I like Faith Fairchild, but the author really missed on this one. It was boring. It had a weaak plot. There was little to figure out. Try another one."
2,"I love everything on this album. Every song is perfect, the guitars are raw like a rusty chainsaw, and Vikernes sings like he was about to kill someone the second after. Standout tracks: the first song and the 25 mins atmospheric one.If you're a catholic or a believer this is a must.5/5"
1,i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent
1,"Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen."
1,"We started out with Swaddlers, then moved to Baby Dry at size 2. At size 3, we switched to Huggies. No Pampers diapers have elastic on the back waist, which just asks for a poo explosion up the back. We had SEVERAL, and I finally realized my friend's diapers had elastic in the back so she didn't have this problem! She had a generic store brand even! I will never put a Pamper on my kid again because I don't want his clothes stained."
1,"Caspian lacks the heart and charm of Lion, Witch, Wardrobe. It felt stale, confusing and similar to the first film, full of dazzling critters rushing head first into another battle to save some ancient kingdom or whatever. It had been almost twenty-five years since I'd read Caspian, so I didn't remember the story. I had a hard time understanding the time frame relative to LWW. I wonder how they're going to gloss over The Horse and His Boy, that one sucked."
2,"CLay Aiken is the best - his CD is fabulous and he is so much better than Ruben Stoddard. He is a genuine American Idol,handsome, cute, loves God, wholesome, and a really nice person. I only hope he stays #1 forever."
1,"I read this on my own and have read other works by Faulkner, so I'm not just some innocent student.On the positive: Faulkner does create good imagery such as the two scenes in the graveyard. I also like that he never tries to explain himself, let's the reader figure it out. The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is ""William Faulkner"". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization. The plot is a simple mystery which depends on timing, coincidence, stupidity and is just unbelievable.If not for the fame of the author, this book would be forgotton."
1,just no. not even close to being listenable. its as annoying as listening to japanese anime before its been dubbed.
1,I signed up just to write this review. I have had printers from Canon Epson Lexmark and Hp in the last 10 years. I have to say that this printer is the worst of the lost.I have had all of the feed issues that others have had and more.My printer cleaned itself so often that the sponge under the ink cartridges actually turned into a mountain. The ink is insanley expensive and does not last long at all. The software is bloated and like others the scanner software just stopped working.I will never buy another HP printer again.
1,"I bought this at Ulta after doing some research regarding chemical peels helping acne, and one of the sales associates recommended this product. My acne has always been pretty mild, but I wanted to see if I could get it under control better. My skin is extremely delicate. My skin actually felt great for the first few days of using this product -- balanced out my skin tone very nicely. Perhaps I should've stopped there, as after a week I broke out with HORRIBLE deep, cystic, painful acne that took me weeks to get over. The scars/pock marks they left behind were even worse. I would be wary if you have sensitive skin. Fortunately, the folks at Ulta remembered me from a few weeks prior and refunded my money. Sadly, I did almost no explaining as my face told the whole story."
1,"Things I like: wireless printing to Mac and PC, scanning, and copying. My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to ""black only"", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of ""helpful"" stuff that pops up all the time. The only way I could see to avoid that was to only install the driver, but then I couldn't use the scanner."
1,"I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it ."
2,this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
1,"Bought this item for my son for christmas, the rollers will not turn, looks like I wasted my money, buyer beware!"
2,"We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
2,"I just love PUR, they have great songs. I am glad that I could get them here in the US. I am German, so I do understand all the words, what makes a different too. Danke, PUR, fuer Eure grossartige Musik."
1,"This movie was a colossal failure. The storyline and plot were good but Burke sucked as Robocop and there are to many unanswered questions from Robo 2 that weren't answered in Robo 3...#1:What happended to the Old Man from Robocop 1&2? Did he die? How did Rip Torn become the Leader of OCP?#2:What happended to Dr. Faxx? Did she just disappear?#3:What happended to the mayor and how did OCP get control of the city?#4:Where is Peter Weller?Do you see what I mean? The only positive things about this movie are the storyline, the introduction of the Rehab team and Basil Poulodoris's theme. John Castle was good as Paul McDaggett but other than him and Nancy Allen (Lewis) no one else really lit up the screen. It is also a shame that Lewis was killed by McDaggett. This movie flopped big time"
1,"i think the love brids are hyping this movie up, this is a review from someone that doesnt by into the love movie Douche thing: Not adams best, very repeatative movie. I dont think he will ever make another Happy gilmore, or Billy madison movie."
1,The children were happy to play with it but since the electronics was so poor they were very dissappointed and left it on the table
1,Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.
2,WONDERFUL DISCRIPTIVE NOVEL. HEARTWARMING & HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. HARD TO PUT IN DOWN. WOULD READ IT AGAIN. CREATIVE WRITING BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR.
2,"As a survivor of the Woodstock generation these artists play the music I love to hear. The musicians are in excellent shape, the line-up is superb, the selections are well-chosen and the DDS 5.1 mix is a showroom example of a proper live concert mix. Ambient and live but clear and focused. All in all an excellent sounding DVD of some top-flight musicians and songwriters strutting their finest stuff with Sir George Martin adding some very fine string embellishments to many of the songs. If you like these artists and their music this DVD will not disappoint you."
1,"I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste."
1,"It's my first time to use TiVo. This product is not user friendly. The hardware setup requirs either network(wired) or phone line, otherwise it won't work. The software designed without exit. If you don't like any choices or you don't which one is good for your case, there is no way to skip. It takes hours to set it up. very bad design in hardware and software.Amazon service is excellent."
2,"Stumbled across this recently and found it an agreeable and on-target accound of life in Japan, based on my own experience. Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) ""teaching in Japan from the male perspective"" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner."
2,"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
2,"Basically all the previous 4 or 5 reviews are correct about the film. So lets talk about the picture, its in a word, great. The story is like action-Exorsist. I think most people will like it. Constantine is dark and its based off a dark comic. Its full of extras and includes an alternate ending so you will NOT feel bad about your purchase. If you are looking for something different to try on HD DVD, then pick up this and a copy of Serenity on HD DVD. This movie is a great way to round out you HD DVD collection."
1,Typical Hollywood movie trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. This movie is slow and does not even make much sense at all. Hopefully most people do not live like this and if they do they would be considered weird.Do not waste your time with this movie!
2,"This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?"
2,"I loved the movie 40 years ago and I love it just as much now. A recent trip to Ireland made it even more moving. The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip. Much of the dialog about the ""troubles"" in Ireland went over my head when I saw the movie as a young women, hovever they made a real an impression this time. Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly."
2,"I was amost completely happy with this soundtrack. What upsets me is that there was on particular track from the game that I loved, and it was because of this track that i payed for this c.d. It was upsetting to find that this c.d. contained every song from the game except for the one that influenced me to buy it in the first place."
2,"Putting things in perspective is only part of what Eduardo learns as he attempts to ""measure up"" to the RULERS. A super little bilingual story on learning how to prioritize our duties."
1,"This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"
1,This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent. Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain. No Latin American countries use Castillian! You'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use.
2,"A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?"
1,"Don't waste your money with this bird feeder - I purchased it because I thought it was cute and the price was right - but they should pay me for using it. It's very poorly made, hard to fill, cheap materials, etc., etc., I think you get the point."
2,"Retired confederate soldier and southern gentleman John Carter is pursued by Indians, and through unexplainable circumstances finds himself transported to Barsoom, known to us earthlings as the planet Mars. There he finds a dying planet of brutal and untamed savagery, contrasted sharply with the rich cultures of its ancient races. Arriving alone, naked and friendless, ""A Princess of Mars"" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."
2,"This was actually better than what most will tell you. And considering the time frame for they're favorite group this has to be considered this group's Masterpiece.Simply put some of us were not waiting for Morning Glory 2. And the imagination put forth on this is simply stunning. ""Magic Pie"" is unmatched for sound and beauty and I can't think of another one of they're CD's that makes me return over and over again.No this is not what may be considered what made them ""Fimiliar to Millions"". This, and I dread this word is ""Art"". Check it."
2,"I tend to purchase DVD's that star actors whom I admire and whose work I enjoy watching. Bill Nighy, McAvoy, Morrissey are but a few of them and do not disappoint. This miniseries is loaded with formidable British actors. The suspense is electric and the characterizations are crisp and often malevolent, which British espionage thrillers do so well. I highly recommend this one."
1,"This toy is quite small. I think when you see this toy, should think if you are going for the block or farm concept. Whichever one it is, either get another farm toy or blocks. (Mega Blocks) Also animals roam, they don't jump, so when child plays they wouldn't naturally want to stick the animal in the block numerous times to get where they are going. Just my thoughts."
2,"This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of King Hezekiah and his life, you must read this book. The scriptures inspire, the story brings courage and hope of God's love, forgiveness, and restoration that He is true to his Word."
1,"This thing is a major piece of junk. It doesn't stick to the wall like it claims. You have to stand to play with it (cause all the cool stuff is at the top), and the extension pieces constantly fall off. I actually screwed it to the wall, but that lasted a whole 10 minutes as it wouldn't stay screwed into the wall. Then the scenery kept falling. Save your money and buy the cool batmobile or something."
1,"I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."
2,Each time I listen to the CD I find new things in the words and the music that pull me in. I purchased this CD on the 15th of October and have listened to it exclusively while in the car since. I will be playing this CD for along time to come.Clays voice is so refreshing and clear that all the songs come across with passion and strength. I would liked to have heard more of the same songs we fell in love with when listening to him on American Idol. Less pop and background singers..Just Clay and his strong voice and range to listen to. A Christmas special CD of all the old Christmas songs we grew up with would be a Classic and show off his fantastic voice. A special on TV for the Holidays with Clay Aiken singing Christmas tunes would be great also.I am already looking forward the next 10 or 20 CDS to come out in the future. He is now my favorite male vocalist.
1,I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
2,"This 1984 release is very interesting since they recorded all tracks in 10 days straight without any overdubs. The title track, Continental Way, Twilight Solitude are the highlights of this album. Here's the tracklist:1 Zoom2 Down Upbeat3 The Continental Way4 Road Rhythm5 Froufrou6 Home Stretch7 Night Storm8 Cookin'up9 Twilight Solitude10 Air Fantasy"
2,LOVED IT PRICE was great! Everything was like new or extremely good quality and have had this for some time and everything still working like a charm! Thanks Amazon!
1,"I intended to use this TiVo with an AT&T Uverse system....Although it was advertised to work(by TiVo) and I got the model that they recommended...it would only receive one channel and about 20% of the time when it tried to record, it would not be able to effectively change to the correct channel."
2,I read this entire series and have never read high adventure written so well! A must for all people who feel they are science fiction or fantasy enthusiasts. The first three books are the best of this superior series.
2,"This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay. Nevermind."
2,"I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way."
2,"This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
2,"When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. But as I neared the end of the book, something struck me. This COULD be OUR future...if we didn't DO something. This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general."
1,"A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
1,"I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real."
2,"With only owning the Crowes first 2, and what some would call their best albums, I was anxious to get By Your Side. It was only more recently that I learned this album was a forced studio effort. It seems, at times, tight and forced, but the true talent of the Crowes shows through. Even under the... supervision of their record company the Crowes add their personal rock n' roll touch and attitude.. Songs like Go Faster, By Your Side, Horsehead, Only A Fool, Go Tell The Congregation and Virtue and Vice will be classic rock songs. In a decade were manufactured teen pop ruled the scene and record companies were trying to make carbon copies, the Crowes keep a breaming rock generation alive."
1,"Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
2,"I have been looking for this CD for years. We use to have it in cassette form and somehow lost it. It's a great CD for travelling, expecially in the Mountains.Thank you Amazon.com"
2,"LA SALSA SE LLEVA EN LA SANGRE. AL IGUAL QUE SUS HERMANOS EDWIN RIVERA Y JERRY RIVERA, SANED LLEVA LA SALSA EN LA SANGRE Y SE PUEDE SENTIR EN CADA UNO DE LOS TEMAS DE ESTE DISCO. SANED ES HERMOSA Y TIENE UNA VOZ INPRESIONANTE!"
1,The TIVO arrived in good condition and was easly to install. However to use the device you must have Internet access for your tv and subscribe to a service with a montly fee. I was not prepared for either and have returned the device to the original shipper.
2,"At first I judged this book by it's cover. DON'T DO THIS!This is a really good book. It's about a teenage girl, Kathrine, who meets a Quaker woman and a little girl and they become friends. Then When a bad sickness comes that clames a lot of lives the people blame the Quaker woman, Hannah and Kathrine. Kit leads Hannah to safty with the help of her friend, Nat. Kit is caught and must stand trial.There is no witchcraft or anything in it. It is not a very fast-past book but worth the read.It is a really good book and I would reccomend it to any Christian or non Christian 12 - adult"
1,"There is a lyric in one of R.Kelly's songs that goes ""What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul"" (How ironic) There is no doubt that this cd will go platinum. It contains all the cliche's, all the typical sex, money, and stereotypical lyrics that too many young gifted artist give in to. My question is where is the substance? How many times do we have to hear how many different ways there are to have sex. I think R.Kelly is extremely talented but he is selling himself short with this garbage. How I long for the days when R&b artist put out material that was thought provoking and original."
2,"I came to this book as a fan of Melville's 'Moby Dick', having recently re-read it and wanting more. That the climax of Moby Dick is taken from an actual incident, and further, that Melville's Ahab might in fact be loosely based on an actual person (the Essex's first mate Chase) is fascinating to me. Also, it is astounding to read about and consider what the men when through during their three months in the open whaleboats after the Essex sank. Philbrick augments this part of the narrative with information gleaned from contemporary medical studies and accounts of persons who have been subject to starvation and lethal dehydration.I can't imagine what it must have been like to contemplate eating the flesh of one's comrades in order to survive, to suck the marrow from their bones to avoid dying of thirst. Incomprehensible."
2,"I am fortunate to be a student in Naader's yoga classes at Yoga Kingdom in Pasadena, CA. As someone who has studied yoga on and off for 25 years, i can confidently say that Naader's class is the most complete and well-rounded I have ever taken. For those in other parts of the world who would like access to an energizing, healing yoga workout, I would highly recommend this video."
2,"In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."
1,This book is a waste of paper. It speaks in terms of generalities that are meaningless. The paragraphs are double spaced and the book is specific to the state of New York. I wouldn't wipe my you know what with the pages from the book. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
2,"While the song selection doesn't allow much room for Clay's awesome glory notes, his amazing voice shines through loud and clear! This album is definitely POP and will forever dispell the Broadway comments often hurled in his direction! Every song on this CD will pull you in...there are no losers here!"
2,"My husband and I decided to by a swing set for our very active daughters 2nd B-day. While the price is kind of steep, its a lot better than $500 and more for the lumber ones that would take days to build or the cheap metal ones that will rust within the next year. So, I believe we made the best decision. Plus our daughter just loves it. And it should last a very long time."
1,"I think this is my first written review for Amazon. I want to save others from wasting time reading this drivel! The writing is terrible, the plot is contrived, and the story is full of stereotypes. Recommend avoiding!"
2,"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo. The book Twenty thousand Leagues Under the Sea was veryinteresting. It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine. This book is very exciting because they are always going on different adventures. The book makes me think about when I first road on a sailboat. In the beginning of this book they are sailing on a boat."
1,"Of the two bands that ATDI splintered into, it should be obvious at this point which one is actually worth listening to. The Mars Volta makes intelligent, frenetic, insane polyrythmic guitar-prog music, while Sparta have found their niche in the world of tepid, whiney radio rock.There's nothing interesting about this album. There are songs that are slightly catchy, but nothing well written or particularly original. Even the cover looks stupid. Waste your money elsewhere."
1,"I found this book in the seatback on an Amtrak train from NY to DC so I don't know if it was forgotten or just left as the trash that it is. It took about ten pages to realize that it was just pure sleeze, and i gave up after getting half way through it within 15 minutes. I could slap myself for wasting that much time. I enjoy good erotica, but this is more like pulp putzing."
1,"I downloaded it for free courtny, then i kept the new songs then deleted the rest..thank for this waster of plastic tho.."
2,"it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?"
1,What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected? Why it wants to be the cartoon of Sinatra?Honestly I continue waiting the return of great pop rock or good new wave rock of Glass Houses! But Billy sadly very sadly your music is made for old man's lovers of Sinatra. Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"**This is the only book that Schure's masterful drama is given in an English translation.**This book is so rare, and I mean so rare that I had to go to a small town called Dornach in Switzerland to find it!!!And of course, it is out-of-print, and so unknown that it will probably never be re-printed again in history....not to say even performed, unless a Schure enthusiast like myself undertakes a task like that!This is the play that the philosopher Rudolf Steiner took as the model to his own 4 Mystery Dramas. Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner. A wonder and deep inspirational experience."
2,"I love historical fiction and was unsure of how I'd like this book when it was recommended to me. I wasn't too familiar with the Old Testament story that this book is about, but this novel really made it come to live. I love Lynn Austin's writing style and have since read many more of her books. This book, though, is the cream of the crop. I loved the characters, the setting, and how the plots interwove together. I've read this a few times since I first read it and it's always as good as the first time."
2,"Ok, the kids accused me of reading it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids."
1,"This is a bootleg. There are legal releases with much better sound quality. Buy Grooving Kingston 12 (Hip-O Records), Completer Wailers parts 2 and 3 (JAD Records) or African Herbsman (Trojan Records) instead."
1,"This book consisted of black and white 2D scetches that lacked any real depth or detail. They are basic and generalised in presenting each period and contain nothing new that you would not have already seen or known about that decade.I do not recommend it to anyone who has a intrest in costume or design, but think it would be better suited as a childrens colouring in book.Don't waste your money."
1,"I am a thin woman and after a few minutes of wearing these, my hands turned blue. So tight. I paid for the darn things so I tried to wear them on my walk, but I was worried that a few more minutes more would mean amputation. I ended up carrying them home. I agree with the woman who said these felt like little useless bean bags. More like little torturous little bean bags."
2,This book is an excellent source of knowledge and information. So much of the information is still relevant today and is timeless. The deep level of knowledge and in sight into the industry and business is a real feast for the novice.Would recommend this to any man that is interested in his clothing image. The value of representing your self to the best of your ability.Colt 45
2,"I truly enjoyed this book, it gives a humanity to the people I have read of in scripture and has a wonderful flow. While no substitute for the bible, it is helpful to remind me that real people face real decisions throughout history."
1,"I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing..."
2,"This is an older edition of ""Leaves of Grass"" , it downloaded fast and I was able to read it in a minute or so."
2,"Bought this for my Dad, as I have come to love having my revolver in an ankle holster. He uses it for his .38 Special. There's nothing fancy here, which is why the price is low. But that doesn't mean that it's ""cheap"" either. It is just a good product at a good price.Recommended for anyone looking. Also, my Dad is 5'6"", I am 6'2"" and this fits both of us equally well. Didn't try it on my 8 year old, but I'm sure it would fit, it's quite adjustable."
1,"I tried online 'live'support and asked for the kit to fix the ""out of paper"" problem, but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time. It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit."
2,"I have to tell you I'am one of those that only buys ""Best Of"" CD'S...I hate to spend the money to only listen to 1 or 2 tracks..With this CD I have listened to every single song from the first time! I can honestly say that this is the only CD I have ever bought that I can listen to again and again. Well worth the price and a CD that will be among my favorites for years to come."
2,"The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor."
2,"I cannot confirm whether this is the 1954 version or later (it lists it as 1955 telecast). The original (1951)had Chet Allen as Amahl. This version has Bill McIver. I watched the Hallmark Hall of Fame each year as they showed this wonderful performance. I have been looking for a release of this version for years. This is close enough to the ""original"" to be collected. The sound and video quality are very good, especially considering what the telecast was like. I have no complaints. The story should be well known from the summary, later versions and the reviews. 50 years have not diminished the greatness and enjoyment of this classic."
2,We have been using the Pampers Baby Dry since my daughter grew out of newborn diapers. I really like that they are flat and easy to put on with one hand. I find that Huggies curl up more and have to be stretched (especially the back waist band)to be put on correctly. The diapers fit my daughter well and hold alot. Can't ask for more than that.
1,"Very stupid adaptation of the DC horror comic book not only lacks brains but also a lacks an actor who can pull off the complex role of John Constantine. Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie."
1,"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."
2,"Christopher Walken is scarier than the aliens, but the film manages to stir up some creepy paranoia at times. The scenes aboard the spaceship (or whatever it was) were a little weak, but in the cabin and in that long spooky school hallway were well done."
2,this movie when i saw it in the theaters was a very good movie. I believe if you liked the first one you'll like this one even better.. worth getting. I'll be getting it soon myself when I get the money to do so.
1,"After experiencing a loss recently, I was looking for books to help me during the difficult days that follow. I was looking for more personal experience or scientific info. All of the references to the bible in relation to pregnancy loss just did not make a connection with me. I am a spiritual person, but I just did not find this book very helpful. There are many other books that I found informative and comforting."
1,"What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"
1,"I bought this product thinking that for the price it would work wonders - boy was I wrong!!!! Sharper image claims that the steam option alone on the machine takes stains out of your carpet - you don't have to resort to carpet shampoos - what a joke!!! I have tried to get out an assortment of stains from my carpet, from dirt to wine, and I am disapointed every time! I have had cheaper steamers that did a better job then this product. The only thing that does work on this item is it's vacuum power."
2,"During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra."
2,"Not only do i love the pampers brand because it fits perfect on my 1yr old but also it holds all her ""stuff"" lol the amount is amazing i didnt have to buy diapers for over 2 months!!"
1,"My father had this book on his shelf so I picked it up last Christmas break and polished it off in one afternoon, and it is obvious that Tom had very little to do with this book. IF you read the introduction, he essentially thanks everybody who found all the various stories for his book. The book is nothing more than a collection of compiled stories with Tom Brokaw's name on the book jacket. Hey Tom, write your own stories!"
1,"Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
2,My son and I had checked this book out from the public library and he loved it! He was so upset when we had to take it back so I decided to look online. We love Mexican food/culture and he thinks it's so funny after knowing the original song!I was so happy to have found it for his birthday!
1,This book was VERY BAD. I HATED it. It is a big book with lots of words. Take my advice and STAY AWAY. I would give this book 0 stars but the minimum they let is 1.
2,This book is engaging and really brings the story to life. It kept me turning the pages and made me look forward to reading the next book in the series.
1,"I didn't really like it. The best part of the show to me was the intro.She seemed to never change that boring outfit. She was way too thin, and her outfits should've been tailor made as they were drooping off of her. She appeared darker, and her hair was way too long and in the way.I do see some Madonna in here, but I don't know who's copying who because they both came out around the same time. But I guess Madonna beat her to the over the top concert extravaganza's.I also saw some of the same moves that Michael did.Her most recent tour seems better than this."
2,"This has to be my favourite WE album. Sam has a great voice & the music is poppy, yet keeps things rocking. These guys are as awesome in concert as in your CD player. Get up & dance!"
2,"i've never read like this book ,, it is really great novel by great author ,, i advise teachers to teach it in their classes.i've read also the pearl by Steinbeck .."
1,I received this product from Amazon without applicator pad and with one bottle broken (Quik detailer). The bottle was broken in pack process because the box don't show external damage.
1,"Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."
2,"What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. No computer image, no sfx, natural good old film. I love this film."
2,Listen up!!!!Get yourself a HD-DVD player and be ready to be blown away with this movie... Great image and sound that will make you swear it is all happening in front of you.Beautiful colors and contrast... INCREDIBLE! INCREDIBLE!! INCREDIBLE!!!This film is a must have!!!
2,"I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."
1,"I found the book to be boring. I only read the book because I was forced to by my English Teacher. The book is extremely vulgar. The reason I gave the book one star is because that is as low as I could give it. If you have to Read it, I suggest getting something like the Coles Notes. This book was awful."
2,"I had a huge wart at the bottom of my big toe a few months ago. I used a brand that says PAINLESSLY REMOVES ... apparently it was painless for the wart, bec. it was so painful for me when the wart swelled to 3x its size and some form of liquid inside. A few more days of pain then the swelling started to subside and wart came off... BUT WAIT... its not done... after a couple of months, I noticed more warts growing... like 7~9 more smaller ones at about the same area.I ordered this last week, didnt start using till 2 days ago... and I was surprised after 1 application, the smaller ones just peeled off in the shower and the bigger ones are not looking as tough and seems about to fall off in another couple of application.Now any suggestions how I can keep them off me?PediFix Wart STICK"
1,I brought lottery master guide. It's helpful and It's takes about 6 months or more. I'm mad to my brother and my parent. I will give NO Stars. Winning the lottery is NOT EASY. My parent is asking for help. Helping other is very important than winning the lottery. I'm so excited to win the lottery but no. It's just a dream. I'm not satisfied about lottery master guide. It's just nothing. Please save your money for your needs?
1,"As others have experienced, mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening, and probably no good at all for the battery. Don't buy."
2,I don't know. I haven't read it. I just like all the trivial facts that I get in my daily email from trivia mailer
1,I'm not sold on social psychology. Part of my issue with this discipline is my personal fight to never let people pigeon-hole me and this seems to want to it on a grand scale. Some of the text does not help one see how issues of individual psychological development tie in to the study of social psychology. This is a great failing because many people no very little about this topic.
2,"Like the movies ""Titanic"" and ""The Great Escape"", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the ""Lafayette Escadrille"". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen ""The DaVinci Code"" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."
1,"I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!"
1,"I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray."
1,"It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie."
2,"The Mark of the Christian was written almost 40 years ago and has less than 40 pages. Despite the thinness of his book, Pastor Schaeffer presents a critical message that many people who profess to be Christians need to hear. As stated in John 13:33-35, love must be the distinguishing mark of all Christians. He who fails to love has not been truly changed by the gospel message."
1,"Sometimes pastiches work well, like Bach's B Minor Mass. Not so this autobiography. Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience. Go there if you must do Franklin."
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"
2,"This is Book 1 in the absolute best Biblical Historical Fiction series I have read to date. The characters are so well developed. Methodical research has gone into this series, as it brings Scripture and this part of Biblical history to life. I give this entire series my strongest recommendation. When you finish each book, you will the know the characters and this part of history and Scripture that much better."
2,"I purchased this book reluctantly. It started out methodically(as THAT HIDIOUS STRENGTH) but had an ending that literally knocks your socks off. I expect a Christian theme with Lewis, but this story delved into more morphous questions of diety and love. Definitely one of Lewis's top five."
2,"I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
1,"Here is a book that talks about thoery, dinsintergration, and practice of love, but really says nothing. He uses vauge phrases like ""the union of conformity...is insufficient to pacify the anxiety of seperateness"" Does't help a person have a better relationship. Only creates mythical boxes for love such as ""God Love, Brotherly Love, Self Love, and Motherly Love"" which he describes in equally abstract language. Would recommend this book only for college students who need to write a report on love, but not for anyone with an interest in enriching their life."
2,This album has been in our family for generations and each Holiday Season we try to play it to bring back wonderful memories. I would highly recommend this for your Christmas Library. This album brings back happy times as a young child and rembering how wonder the Christmas season is when Family and friends are close.
2,"What's to say, really. It's sorta Tarl Cabot meets Jack Ryan. Without the pages of goofy internal dialogue or the Russian order of battle."
1,I am very disappointed with this CD set. I hardly recognize the sound on many songs. My favorite is Georgia on My Mind. I never heard a rendition like the one in this set. It is terrible. I am sorry I made this purchase.
2,"The movie Bill Engvall: 15 Degrees Off Cool, is I think by far one of his better movies. He is such a good comedian."
2,"pampers diapers are the best i've used, they're perfect! although they are thin, they're very absorbent and almost always catch even the most severe blizzard. some other brands are thick and bulky and don't do as good a job as pampers, and thick diapers also look rediculous under bubster's clothes. this economy pack seems like great value, too!"
2,"""Other Side of Love"" was never released on either of Yazoo's albums. It was released as a single between the two albums. After years of searching I finally found it on CD!!""Other Side"" is a happy upbeat tune that has a bit that sounds like ""Just Can't Get Enough"" which after all Vince wrote for Depeche Mode.If you have both albums get this single and complete your Yazoo songlist!"
2,"The author may want to stay more on the subject of the people you are talking about to make it easier to understand, especially if the readers are not from that generation, as I am only 16. Great idea though! Each generation who had to fight in a war should be remembered!!! Telling each person's story made it much more interesting! I liked that I could skip around without much of a problem."
1,I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
2,"This is an awesome novel. It reminds me of Julie Rayzor Romance, Adevnture, Zombies. Both are good books. Even for a first person novel there are a lot of ""I""s. I did this. I saw that. Other than that it is interesting. Julie Rayzor is first person also.."
1,"Very disappointed! The book was missing several chapters. Because it was needed for school, we were forced to purchase another copy."
2,OMG... if you don't have Clay's CD you MUST get it! All of the songs are so beautiful and it shows off Clay's voice perfectly. My personal favorite is Shine and Measure of a Man. (Also I would recommend that you get his new single with Solitaire :) )
2,"Ostebee and Zorn presented Calculus in a mind stimulating and reform way. No more copying examples out of the book because every problem is the same. This book makes you discover the methods and understanding. The basic understandings are provided, but the rest is up to you! I have never understood Calculus so thoroughly! I do not rate the book five stars, because of the unreliable solutions manual. The book is geared toward user discovery, so the solutions in the manual need to be CORRECT in order for the user to benefit the most."
2,"The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way."
2,This is great dela because you save almost $8 on this box if you were to purchase 2 boxes at the store. Now we have diapers for twice as long for less money! Will buy again for sure!
1,"I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
2,"I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind."
2,This is a really good movie. It's divided in two DVD. It keeps your attention until the end. I'd recommend for anyone who wants a first approach to Padre Pio's history. It gives you the desire of start reading and searching about him. It's spirituality is incredible. I would watch it again and again.
2,"I was so thrilled when TIVO came out with this wireless adapter !! With cell phones increasingly replacing the need for a land line, TIVO hopped on the wagon. The only reason I had a land line was for my TIVO service. With the wireless adapter, I had my land line disconnected and am happy to save that monthly expense.Adapter works great and I've had no problems with it over the last 10 months or so since I purchased it.It was easy to get working !"
2,"I had searched high and low in my local stores for high quality mens silk pajamas, but was not satisfied with what I found. The Intimo brand carried by Amazon fit all of my requirements to a ""T"". They fit very well, are extremely comfortable, and launder well. I just purchased my third pair. All I can add is: Try these pj's, and you'll have sweet dreams all night!"
1,"Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!"
1,"I've used Huggies and Pampers and settled on Pampers. I loved the Swaddlers and the Cruisers were pretty good. I accidentally ordered these instead of the Cruisers and didn't know that until we pulled these out. They are smaller than the same size in Cruisers, thinner and my son leaks overnight even if his diapers was changed at 3 or 4 a.m. if he's not changed every 1-2 hours! Ridiculous. Do not waste your money. Do not buy."
2,"I love this movie for so many reasons, but first and foremost is the classic love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of England. Theirs is a love story for the ages. I love period pieces and I love English history and this is one of my all time top 10 favorite movies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone whether you love English history or if you just love a great love story. Victoria Hamilton and Jonathan Firth play Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to perfection and are both superb actors. A very well acted movie with a great story. I would highly recommend."
2,"Good quality overall. The braket for the stem didn't fit my application, so I improvised, and mounted it behind the seat over the rear fender and low. Holds stuff."
2,"Number one, Russell Crowe need to stick to acting. He can't sing. (Well, Kris can't either but at least his voice has something that holds on to you.)Number two, Brian McKnight on Bobby McGee?? That's just plain w-r-o-n-g. I can't stand to listen to it.Otherwise, the rest of it is just fantastic."
1,"As advertised, the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts. When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from ""ABC"" (manufactured in Vietnam). The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts. This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last."
2,"_Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children."
1,I used this for a year and a half on a wart on the underside of my big toe. All it did was kill all the healthy skin around it.
2,"forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as ""Fats"", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor."
2,"I bought 2 of these for both my husband and me. The review that said it was a little too small for men's shoes doesn't apply to us. My husband wears an average size 10 shoe and has no problem fitting several pairs of shoes on this rack. Assembly is very easy and once assembled, the shelves swivel so you can easily get to any shoe. It's also very sturdy and quite large. If I have to say anything negative at all, it would be that it's almost too big to put two of them in one 6 x 10 walk-in closet. Other than that, it is a perfect alternative to leaving shoes on the floor. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,my son was convinced that this book would not ever be available so he was very pleased with it and I was pleased because I received it in a timely manner and it was in great condition.
2,"To deal with that prodigious and proverbial actor named Sir Laurence Olivier is far to be a piece of cake;on the contrary is a big challenge to any actor; and Caine did it without major hindrances. This movie is part of the great tradition of the grateful British literature - nourished by Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie among the most renowned ones - featured by this well known cerebral handle of clues and riddles that challenge the spectator, when a tricked man invites to his wife's lover into a diabolical trap. But the point is who will get the last laugh on whom?A memorable tour de force all the way through."
2,"I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
1,neither artist are together on this cd u get five tracks of stanley anf the rest gloria all badly re issued on cd ...please dont waste your money as i did
1,"We had to read it for our GCSE coursework. Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"
1,"I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore. They have the imitation leather cover. All of the covers have come unbound from the pages. Very poor quality. I love the NASB, but this is just poorly made."
1,"This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card."
1,I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
2,"It's rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. This CD does it. It also gets my 1 year old son shaking his nappy so strong is the rhythm. Familiar songs given a piano jazz working maybe an ignoramus' view but that's what it is. I am amazed this trio weren't hawked to me as part of a back catalogue release sooner. But this proves there are some musical gems yet to be re-released in the noughties. Ramsay, your public needs you - where are you?"
2,I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD
1,"It offers nothing but mystery. The first volume was left me a bit clueless. I had bought this hoping it would answer some of the questions of the first volume, like what is up with the ceremony, the main charector or even what does the TA's have to do with any of this. It appears to be extremely slow. So far there is nothing much more than talking with a little bit of action in the 2 DVDs. It makes it seem like you need to buy the next DVD for the answers, but they do not give enough episodes per DVD for price and I usually do not buy any more of a series if I did not enjoy the first few episodes, more of less the first 7. This DVD make me feel like I would be wasting money if I were to finish the series. I recommend watching one of the Gundam series, at least that might offer more action, plot or even comedy."
2,"Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. The AEC's trademark percussion ensembles, jocular takes on marching music, etc., are surrounded by inspired playing. ""New York is full of lonely people"" is one of Lester Bowie's most enduring and beautiful melodies. Long enough to allow the group to do its characteristic stretching of time on long improvs, this is still, in my view, an accessible record. A great place to start exploring the music of the full quintet version of the band, along with their other ECM albums, and a pair of their live sets from early 70's."
2,"I bought these diapers because of the incredible deal with the Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom discount combo (note: the price has now increased from when I ordered in June). The diapers are ""good"" in that they haven't leaked. They do not get 5 stars for the following reason: They are a little ""flimsy"". So, even if my daughter doesn't need a diaper change due to contents, she needs a diaper change more often because they lose their shape around her and don't cover her well. I did not have this problem with the Sam's Club brand diapers. So, although they were slightly less expensive per diaper, I have ended up using MORE diapers because I have to change my daughter more often. Other than the ""flimsiness"", I like the diapers."
2,"This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's ""Prince"" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious ""Book"" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."
2,"Most of the characters were annoying in this book. I do like how each one got a chance to tell ""their"" side of the story.Not one of her best but still made for a pleasent read."
2,"I love this little kitchen. We might have to buy something bigger because we have so many kitchen pots, pans, food and such....but we will still hang onto this kitchen. My 3 kids love it! Also, it can be assembled in minutes!"
2,"I got my little 4 cup brewer as a high school graduation present. This thing has made it through the dorms, through several apartments and terrible roommates, and finally into my new home! I have had this thing for over 6 years and it is still completely fabulous. It is so easy to use, and has never given me any problems. I don't even clean it as often as I should and the quality of the coffee is still excellent. I am going to be sad when it comes time to stop using this, because it's so easy to use and makes great coffee! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It was perfect for the small dorms and perfect for a home."
1,A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
2,"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"
2,"I have installed this set on my bike to get the attention of NYC motorists who, from experience with other warning devices, would otherwise fail to notice me or the bike in traffic. Having tried LED flashing lamps and other warning indicators, the strobe is the only lamp visible in daylight and sufficiently intense to prevent motorists from opening doors, making turns and blissfully changing lanes in ignorance of a cyclist. My only complaint concerns their reliability. I had to have two sets replaced until I got one that kept working. The lamps deplete AA batteries rapidly and I recommend using 2000 mAhr rechargeable NiMh cells which will provide an operational life of a couple of hours."
2,"""Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree."" 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."
2,"As I read No Disrespect, I developed a new respect for Sister Souljah - for she is bright, strong, sober, calculating, and in your face, telling it like it is! I've read works of so-called prolific writers more than twice her age, yet none have touched nerves and brought revelation to me as she has in No Disrespect!I smiled to myself as I read the penetrating questions she asked the people in her life. I admire her! I wish every Black man and woman could and would read this enlightening tome, for it is a life changing adventure into a world where knowledge is king! The multitude of lessons learned are a by-product of a very entertaining read!"
1,"Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one."
2,"Florence King is one tough broad: a meat eating, heat packing, bisexual Republican who has NO patience for whiners, slackers,huggies, fuzzy wuzzies, or anyone even remotely PC. But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout. You go,girl!"
1,"Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back. I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting."
1,This book and his website is totally crap.He teach samp technique which annoy any serious customer.He keep saying about how he make millions of dollar.I think he is lying. He's website look like the one designed by secondary school boy
2,"What I appreciate most about this book is the author's honesty and candid writing. Because she too has suffered, she can relate to the reader's feelings of denial, grief and loss. Each entry is comforting, thought provoking, and will allow you to go at your own pace. I read some things more than once and skipped around, too, to whatever was appropriate for how I felt at the time. A must have if you have lost a loved one, or know someone who is dealing with this situation. It's just like talking to a good friend."
2,My dermatologists recommended Eucerin Extra Protective Moisture Lotion about 3 years ago. It is so highly recommended because it does not clog pores and protects the skin from very harmful UV rays. I recommend Eucerin Extra Protective Moisture Lotion to everyone!
2,"It's about a special classroom of only a few children. They have all kinds of different problems and together they make progress. It is not always success stories, but that's good. It's real. It's mostly about Ladbrooke, a volunteer who has a child in the class and Ladbrooke is the one who gets the most out of the class. It is an interesting book."
2,"I can't understand why some people are bashing this perfectly wonderful CD and the immense talent of its singer. What do these so-called ""critics"" (or ""bashers"") think real music is -- someone rapping in nonsense or screaming inaudible and offensive lyrics?? Clay Aiken is a breath of fresh air in this day and age and deserves the accolades he receives. Everyone with the money should spend it on this perfectly wonderful album -- not waste it on the mainstream of trash."
2,The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze.
2,"We have twin boys and the economy pack of pampers is the way to go for us. We like pampers more than the other brands (and we've been through most) because they are thinner, have a light fresh odor, and hold just as much without the blowouts. We were getting diapers from costco, but for the same price and the free shipping to our house its a great deal."
1,"Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."
1,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."
2,"This Meguiar's wash and wax kit is an incredible value and the products are great. Meguiar's started as a furniture polish manufacturer 100 years ago. Over the years they've been perfecting their cleaning and polishing products (no, I'm not a Meguiar's employee! I just like to learn about the history of things). The Quik Detailer sprays are great for cleaning in a pinch. Washing and waxing with Meguiar's results in a great shine. The wheel cleaner is easy to use and my wheels look great.If you priced these out separately (even here on Amazon), you would pay AT LEAST 3 times the price for what you get in this kit. If you want to clean and detail your own car, this kit is hard to beat."
2,Fits me as if it were custom tailored. I highly reccomend this item. I have paid twice as much for shirts nowhere near as good as this one.
1,"I was extremely disappointed by Amazon. I needed this text book for a course and Amazon sent me the 2nd edition of the text; which is the older version; there is a 3rd edition out of this text.This is a terrible blunder by Amazon and it cost me undue stress and money since I now have to replace it with the newer edition, which I will purchase from my campus bookstore."
1,"i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!"
1,"This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a ""preferred book"" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it. I found it BEYOND tedious.What's wrong with me? Why does everyone love this novel and I found it so annoying?Sign me ~BEWILDERED"
2,"The cable works great. I have been uploading Digital8 video to my processor for editing projects with no problems. The cord could be a bit longer than its 1.5 meters but that's not a major concern. It was a bit pricey, but the steep markup on cords is pretty common across the board. All in all a good purchase."
2,"A must for any afficionado of Batman movies. My kids loved seeing each new ""toy"" as Batman discovered the secret arsenal he had and then the creation of the Bat Cave. And, in my humble opinion, Christian Bale is still the best of the Batman actors."
2,I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!
1,"One of the book covers was torn and covered with a black substance. It was unsuitable to gift to the intended recipient. I had to obtain another book locally. I tried to contact Horizon Books via telephone, but never got an answer. I would appreciate a replacement copy!"
2,"The movie was good right down to that ending. If it were me I would just kill the people and kill the baby. The baby wasn`t even a normal baby. I just think that it was a great movie but should have made the ending better, but that`s not the director`s fault it`s the author`s."
1,"I was sorry to see a fresh new author with such potential resort to stereotyped shallow character development, especially of her lesbian characters. These charaters (or shall I say caricatures) make the story lose its believablity and will distance many readers whose understanding of or expeirence in gay/lesbian culture goes beyond what they have learned from Jerry Springer."
2,If your'e reading this then you already know you like these three CD's. You'll like it better knowing you're getting such a great deal from Amazon. Three CD's for the price of one. Need I say more?
1,Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking.
2,"I saw this movie and i thought that the twins were really good.But,I really like the way that Robert Clark played Helmet Head.Keep showing more movies with him."
2,"I had the reported switching problem (""UPDATE: This device has one annoying defect ... a ""clever"" feature of switching inputs automatically when it senses no input on one of the two stereo inputs ... any stretch of silence will cause it to switch""). I called AudioSource and I have to give them credit. The problem is relatively easy to solve by using Input 2 instead of Input 1 if you're only using one input."
1,"The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it."
2,"The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it."
2,The product was in good condition and it came in the mail in a timely manner.
1,"Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache."

2,"This is not your average kid's tape! Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!"
1,"It was first FW album I've listened to. And I'm afraid I'll never buy their CDs again. I don't want to waste my money. Well, I've heard FW is one of the prog metal monsters. Perhaps... Dream Theatre, for instance, doesn't have any such a pale album. This album has just some elements of progressive. If I have not heard it's prog rock group I'd never supposed it's progressive. Ok, the CD now is in used CD department and I hope I'll return some money."
2,"Assembly was pretty straight forward, and when you're all done with the TV on top ... looks pretty slick. Strap in back secures TV, and cover in front does the same.Due to support beams in back, my receiver had to go right in the middle on the 2nd shelf. Those same beams, could possibly get in the way of wiring on the top shelf if putting components two across. In fact, I need to get a couple of right-angle connectors in my case. There is also a chance since the glass is at an angle on the sides, that one foot of a componenent all the way to either side may not touch the glass. I also wish the top shelf was a little taller for stacking components.Even with these quibbles, I am very happy with the stand, because the quality is very nice, and the end result looks great & feels solid."
2,AWESOME MOVIE!!! Trilling-Action-Packed!! Begins back your childhood!! Love it!!! MUST SEE IT!! GREAT FOR A MOVIE NIGHT FOR FRIENDS OR FAMILY!!!
1,Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
2,"Altho I have no memory of watching ""Amahl"" on TV as a young child, I think I must have - the music is sweetly nostalgic for me. This DVD version is lovely. Touching, poignant, and well-sung. I have no problem whatsoever with the visuals and audio - they're what I grew up with!"
2,This allows my wife to have support on all sides during sleep. She now can sleep through the night with waking. This is an exellent buy and well worth the investment.
1,I strongly erge you to get a life if you like this book. It was boring and i could hardly get through it.... uuuhhhhhhhh....i would give it -5 stars but you can't. uuuhhhhhh.
2,Absolutely adorable. Very sturdy. Great that we can use the crib mattress instead of purhasing a special mattress. Very easy to put together. My grandson absolutely loves it.
2,"Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll. This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe. Amazing lyrics, otherworldly guitar by Noel, and the best chops in rock by Liam, culimating with the incredible ""Slide Away"".If you only own 10 CD's, this is a must."
2,"I purchased this book for a class, rather than for enjoyment. That said, I found the book to be very informative and relatively easy to read. Of the two textbooks that I purchased, I most definitely prefer this one."

1,"Unless you like syrupy power ballads that all sound the same, I would save my money. Mr. Aiken is overrated and over-hyped."
1,"I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
1,"Dear Sirs,I purchased one of the Mr. Coffee CG12 coffeemakers in November of 2005. I have never seen a more poorly designed coffeemaker. What a piece of refuse! Because of its faulty design, it got coffee all over the countertop whenever it was brewing. I tried two of them and they both did the same thing. The whole design was slapdash. It should be taken off the market.After putting up with it for two months, I threw it in the trash and bought a Black and Decker. It was like going from a VW to a Rolls. Never again."
2,"Great price...well over half off of the university's bookstore. Only black and white pictures and illustrations, but very thorough coverage of entomology."
2,I would just like to say that I love this choir New Direction. I bought the Cd after seeing them perform in Cinncinnatti at a convention. I went right out the next day and got it. i just want to tell those young people to keep up the good work. May GOd bless them
2,I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
1,"Most of the time when I write a review that has anything negative in it, it doesn't get posted but again I will take that chance. This is not only the worst Queen cd EVER but almost the worst CD I've heard PERIOD! Honestly, it sounds like they made up the songs as they played them! In contrast to Queens ""The Game"" which may be in my top 5 cd's of all time which is a masterpiece. People who give this mess 5 stars really must like Queen -or- are in the group. ... where are the guitars? They must have made the cd sound the way it does because ""synth"" was in .. but it wasn't ""them"" and it shows, badly. To give this 5 stars detracts from the true greats like A Day At The Races and News Of The World. I'm a Queen fan but I'm not blind to anything they play."
1,"This movie was made just after the first resurgence of movie musicals, the first round being Moulin Rouge, Knight's Tale, and Chicago. So the French decided to get in on the trend and do a musical as well, but apparently this is much too happy a concept for the French personality, and they butchered the job. The movie is filmed like a British stage mystery; 8 women snowed into a house with a dead man, murdered by one of them, telephone cut, who's next to be killed? On this level alone, the movie is trite, unimaginative, and poorly done. Then to make it worse, at some point each one of the 8 woman will have a singing/dancing number, unbelievably bad choreography coupled with a song of no musical value, some of which are actually painful to endure.The only way to get anything out of this movie is to turn off the sound and just watch Catherine Deneuve act and move (except for her badly done dance number)."
2,"My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!"
2,"adapt to study the general and global laws of techinal analysis; no for fanatical man, but for who want to create a persoanl knowledge about this discipline"
2,"Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story."
1,"My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money."
1,"The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."
1,"This paperback, one of the Barnes and Noble ""Classics Editions"" is a republication of the original English translation by Rev. Lewis Page Mercier made in 1872. Mercier's translation leaves out 20% of the book and makes numerous other textual errors. These facts have been known for fifty years. The editor is a Victoria Blake, not otherwise identified, who in fact recommends in the Appendix that for further reading one might consult the complete novel as translated by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter and published by the Naval Institute Press in 1993."
1,"It came eith a hole, so from day 1 i couln't use it without a patch, and i had to buy another patch because this one didn't work either"
2,The more I listen to Clay's new CD the better I like it. He has a beautiful voice and I could listen to it all day. You can understand the words as he sings them which is not the case for alot of other singers. I hope he continues to sing and make more CDs but most of all I hope he finishes his education.
1,"Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are."
1,The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away.
1,"This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
1,"I wasn't too impressed by these diapers. The diaper itself stays dry overnight and doesn't leak through if the baby just pees. However, these diapers (size 2) seem low on my 14 lb baby (he is on the longer side though) and he had several leaks (pooped out the back and front at the same time on several occasions), honestly, I wondered if I should have gotten a size 3 for him. The size 2 pampers swaddlers are great and the pampers baby dry just don't compare."
1,"The first part of this book started off pretty good. I was able to do and understand the simple login application. After that, it made me feel pretty stupid. I completely lost focus due to lack of examples and the ever compounding lecture on tough topics. When it came to the final Artimus application, which is basically a huge conglomeration of just about every possible thing you can do, I was completely lost and couldn't get it working with WSAD. I gave up, i'm getting a different book."
1,This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended.
2,As someone who likes literature I must say this book is one of the most enjoyable book I've evr read. I analyzed this novel as a realistic one but it's not so gray as most of realistic stories I've read. it has all the emotions 445 pages you can cry be afraid to luagh and to just be happy from reading the book. the main charactor- Francy- She is a wonderfull girl with a lot of imagination and very smart and good I also liked the grandmother - Marry Romely wich is the symbole of the idea that you don't have know reading and writting in order to be smart. she is very good and too smart I know many people who studied in the university but still not as smart as she does.
2,"This book is a feel-good fun romp! It's a fast, enjoyable read. I love the characters, they are three dimensional and have things happen to them that could, and probably would, happen to any of us. I'm looking forward to the next one!"
2,"This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people."
2,I agree with the other reviews that you have to have thin wrists for this to fit/be comfortable. I'm quite petite and have a hard time slipping on the wrist weights.
2,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
1,"Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess. They are giving way too much talent and class to a film that has none of their qualities.Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle"
1,So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
1,We used Swaddlers size 1 and thought would changed to this for size 2 to see what's the difference. We found that this one leaks! It also has a little chemical smell and the size isn't as big as Swaddlers size 2. Pamper Swaddlers is much better in our opinion.
1,"I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."
2,"Very dreamy, shoe-gazer pop reminiscient of Catherine Wheel (in fact, the lead vocals sounds very much like Rob Dickinson's hushed vocals on ""Ferment"" 15 years prior), only with tighter beats and more dramatic drone where appropriate. These guys are ultra-personable on-stage as well so it will come as no suprise when they're playing live on the O.C. Season Finale (not that it would be a bad thing)."
2,"I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
1,"As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here."
1,"Super crappy film that not only makes you feel stupid once you have seen it but will make you want to have a drink just to forget about it right after its over. Keanu Reeves is miscast in a very very bad way and the story is not very interesting at all. Certain thing that are introduce in terms of narrative in the beginning of the film is thrown out by the end of the second act in order to put on a ridiculous third act that makes everything about the movie into a bad and tasteless joke. Rachel Weisz does do wonders with the script and her role and the universal praise she is getting is well deserved but she gives the only good performance in the entire movie while the rest of the actors in the film can't rise above the bad material they are given. I did not even know that this was a comic book before but now that I do, I know why it was so bad to begin with."
1,"I went to the dermatologist to get what I was told was a wart, frozen off. It had been there for years so the dermatologist said it might be a tough one to treat, so after freezing it she gave me this wart stick, and told me to apply it every other night and cover it with duct tape. What she didn't tell me, and what was NOT listed on the instructions on the box, was that this stuff needs to be applied exactly to only the wart, because if it gets on any of the surrounding skin, it will burn it off. I can't tell if the product is working because it is just burning off more skin every time I use it and I don't think I'm going to continue using it."
2,"You know that an artist is popular when he garners so many reviews from so many people that love and hate him but this guy is a rising star!It took a lot of guts to get up in front of a panel of judges to audition for American Idol and then even more guts to sing in front of Simon and the rest of America!This album contains songs from different genres of popular music so there's something for everyone. I personally love them all! Give it a chance. I'm sure that you will NOT be disappointed.We gave Clay a chance and look where he is now!And for those of you who keep saying that he's ugly, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and see what's inside."
2,"We got this printer last year and have really liked it because it works pretty fast and we wanted something to print just text so we wouldn't have to keep replacing inkjet carts. We also got aNETGEAR PS121 USB 2.0 Mini Print Serverand it has all worked on our home network pretty well together, including with a PC that runs Win 98se (which had, much to my suprise, a usb port which was mandatory to set up the print server)."
1,I just want to know how I pulled this up when I clicked on a cutting board to &quot;view details&quot; on a bridal registry??? This isn't the first time this has happened!!
2,"I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions . This is the best you can get to attending a class yourself. I felt engaged and involved in the class just by watching it on the Television. It covers everything that you need to know about childbirth and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go!"
2,"Before the beginning of this century, the only information we had about Ancient Babylon was from the Bible. Consequently, most of the literature that I have read on the subject (written during the height of Iraqi Archeaology in the 1920's and 30's) has been on a religious note rather than a historical one. This book changed all that. It brought a highly academic subject to the layman. It is a simple, informative account of how the real Babylonians lived. It describes the Babylonians as an advanced people who appreciated art and literature, as well as entering into contracts and having mortgages. It is a great introduction to an ancient civilisation."
2,Quick delivery on these 2 wireless adapters let us install and get our TIVO up and running in no time. These adapters allows our two tivo's to basically talk to each other. We can watch what is recording on one can be view on the other. Great reception as well. The TIVO people will walk you thru installation if necessary.
1,"What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
1,"I'll be the first one to sadly admit, I bought this album only having heard ""Tubthumping"". That was a huge mistake. If you're considering buying this album only because of that, please DON'T! ""Tubthumping"" gets old after a while anyways. The rest of this CD is hardly worth listening to. There are some mediocre songs here and there, but trust me, this is not worth your [money]."
2,"...and loved it! i don't have a metal background, but james plotkin's work in OLD, and his guitar work (not bass work--nic bullen was scorn's bassist) on scorn's amazing album evanescence made me check them out.this album is a good intro to their sound, which now is even more concerned with pure sound as its main device. plotkin's bass' microtones are amazing."
1,"The book did bring back pleasant memories of attending a Catholic School. It's too bad that Gina Cascone hated attending a Catholic School. I kept reading hoping that at some time she would say something good about being a Catholic. But that never happened. If I hadn't experienced Catholic Schools myself, this book would convince me that sending your child to a Catholic school is child abuse. I only recommend this book for people who hated being Catholic."
1,"I really wanted this to be a better book, especially when faced with all the ""Wait until you get to the TWIST!"" comments I had heard. Um, well, I assumed what the ""TWIST"" was about 10 pages into the book.Great idea, just overwrought prose and not nearly creepy enough."
2,This is a small game - easy to pack and take anywhere. It is a lot of fun for kids all ages. My 5 year old recieved it at Christmas but it was played all day by kids younger and older. It gets a laugh every time. The jaw came undone once - but was easy to put back together. It's nice to see the kids enjoy such a simple game among all the techie toys they recieved.
1,"Like all great Rock Groups who made several albums together Queen had some misfires. Hot Space is one such misfire. After the excellent The Game provided Queen with a major disco style hit in Another One Bites The Dust Queen decided they would make an album largly steeped in a Dance/Disco sound but the songs are not as good. This album fails with the exception of the songs that do not take this approach Life Is Real, Under Pressure, Los Polabras De Amor, Calling all Girls and Put Out The Fire."
2,Standard high quality piece of equipment.Cleans up easily.Works perfectly for steaming and frothing milk.Definitely would purchase again.
1,"I bought these highlighters thinking that they would last for a long time. Being a college student, I have a lot that needs to get highlighted. These highlighters did not last me long at all."
2,"Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
1,"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
2,system of a down combines the hard rock of groups such as korn and smashing pumkins with the operatic rock of such groups as queen. above and beyond
2,"This book is a deeply intimate and emotional account of how one man, earnestly seeking truth and meaning his whole adult life, was spiritually reborn after meeting Abdu'l-Baha.Some of you may be fans of the ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. This book, like Tolle's, will if you are ready for it, completely and utterly shatter your world view.Now the work is to hold on to this new perspective! Thankfully we can read the books over again. :o)"
2,"this was by far the best of the 3 movies. the human interaction is better and the robot battles are infinitely better. from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-stop action. this is one of the few movies i saw 2 times in the theater. once in the regular screen and once in imax 3D. it was money well spent. i would tell anyone who is thinking of buying it, to DEFINITELY buy it!"
1,I was a bit disappointed in this book. The beginning started out well and then I lost interest in the subject matter.
1,"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."
2,"I completely enjoyed this book. ""Dr Jack"" captured the current possibilities of cloning in his new book. It was hard to put it down, especially since I work in the biotechnology field. I especially love the ending (which I will not give away). You will just have to read it yourself."
2,"I have already rated and reviewed this album...........the best one of 2003!! But I have one more comment to make to the person that said great singers are only those who write their own music and lyrics. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley............shall I go on?! They didn't write hardly any of their music. They had people write for them. Why? Because they were the greatest interpators of a song and song writers lined up to have them sing their songs. Clay is the next one in line!! And whose to say he may not write some of his songs in the future?! Some of you people need to understand what music is all about. Just like a book or a movie its all about what we enjoy on an individual basis. If its not your taste in music you don't need to write a scathing review, just say its not your cup of tea and keep your biased opinions to yourself."
1,"TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."
2,"With such names as Jazzanova, Rainer Truby Trio, MAW, Ian Pooley and Cujo (aka Amon Tobin), this compilation could do no wrong. Tracks were selected by Rainer Truby, a well-respected Compost project, and a guy with a low profile and a great musical instinct (check out his Glucklich series). UK's Nuphonic, along with SF's Ubiquity, is TMHO the world's no 1 label in dancefloor-friendly nu-jazz; watch out for their releases, and let everybody else wait 1-2 years for the next 'ground-breaking' and 'genre-defining' compilation from Guidance."
1,By something else. This is the worst piece of machinery I have ever bought. Virtually impossible to cut any size tile on the diagonal. Typical imported junk!!!!!
1,"Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
2,"The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space."
1,"Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
2,"For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it."
1,"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."
1,"What is happening here. First, a sub-par greatest hits album and then this sad best of the box. I love Nirvana but Courtney Love is really tampering with Kurt Cobains catalogue. The greatest hits should of had breed, polly, and verse chorus verse. Back to the box set now.This best of the box isn't even the best of!"
2,Really miss this show. It is fun to watch the episodes and see the characters interplay. I am ready for the next Stargate show to begin.I did not realize how long the show had been on for.
2,"A lot of information in this book that I never knew about Ben. It is short, and was not complete, but still a lot about his younger years."
2,"If you don't believe in her politics, listen to the music - we can't all be John Lennon. But we could aspire to be Public Enemy - different genre, same ethos. With her minimalist approach, she jettisons a rapid-fire selection of rage, humour, politics [sometimes muddled and confusing], sex...but always arresting and thought provoking. Online pugilists argue the terrorist/Tamil revolutionary ties via her father, and while it's an important salient subject to spelunk, weaving the politico with the dance floor is an exhilarating art I can't overlook based on that writ - Madonna could learn a thing or two about juxtaposing them creatively [see American Life]. My grade: A"
1,"We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."
1,"It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. However, in less than five years of ownership I noticed the topper lost a considerable amount of firmness. It became too soft to sleep on except for the edges and I found myself waking up less refreshed. It's like trying to sleep on a 'V' shaped mattress.I contacted the manufacturer, Foamex, twice via email but they never responded. Finally I called and was told they won't service the mattress; redirecting me back to the seller who has since gone out of business. I have no experience with this seller, however I would suggest anyone considering purchasing a Sensus brand viscoelastic mattress or topper be aware that you will likely have problems before the ten-year warranty has expired. Plus, even if you find a seller who doesn't turn a warranty claim into a hassle, you will find they are rather expensive to repackage and ship. I will not purchase another Sensus or Reflex brand product."
1,"Having owned and enjoyed the authors other cookbooks, getting this one was an easy decision. The good reviews helped as well.After trying a few of the recipes, I call foul.Sauces with no thickening agent were runny, dressings were bland, and main entries that were just not palatable.I'll just tweak recipes from current cookbooks to make them low carb.Oh, and on a side note, it was interesting to note that on the authors web site, this title is not even mentioned among her many other, and delightful, books."
2,"These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting."
1,"this thing smells and transfers the smell to your hands. very chemical like poisonous odor. put it in a cotton sock until this comes, then will throw it away.IMAK Stress Ball, Grey (Pack of 4)"
1,"What a pain it is to deal with a bunch of little steel rods to slip into the pouches to adjust the weight. The picture and description didn't really show the product well when I ordered this rather pricey item. I took the weight out of the box, looked at it, and put it back in. Probably will donate to some worthy cause. I ended up going to a big box retail store and just buying a non-adjustable weight."
2,The package came inmediately and in good conditions. Series have becomes more action pack that before. Showed lots of new superheroes and how they'll be attach to Superman. AWESOME!!
1,The information was presented in simple language for the non-statistician. It was helpful to consider how statistics are presented and how they can be interpreted. The examples were outdated.
2,Finally I found bike rack that fit for my car 1995 Toyota Celica. This mount rack goes over the spoiler. It's very sturdy to carry my two mountain bikes.
1,"This is the same DVD as Rod Stewart & the Faces - The Final Concert. It's the one with Keith Richards in it.THIS IS NOT A NEW DVD.If you enlarge the photo you can see that someone cut and pasted the WRONG people at their instruments. Ronnie Wood is playing the keyboards, Kenny Jones is playing the bass, and the late Ronnie Lane is playing the drums. In fact, Lane is not even on this DVD, Tetsu is."
2,I don't really remember what's on this one. I purchased to install in my MP3 for walking/jogging and it's fine
2,"I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book."
1,This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
1,"Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
1,"This device should configure a lot easier than it does. I'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware. I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website. Once you get the correct version of the drivers, and install it following the instructions EXACTLY (the device cannot be plugged in while loading the software) it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device. 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002. The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does. I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more, and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types."
2,"I just loved this movie - I have seen this so many times and still find myself completely in love with Nicholas Cage and his tormented, passionate demeanor in this flick. He and Cher light up the screen and you find yourself wanting more at the end. Another hopeless romantic film that you just can't get enough of."
1,"After reading some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. I purchased two and put them to the test. I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader. For reasons I can't explain, the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up. To double check if it was something else, I reproduced the problem 3 more times. I didn't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar, no prob!! So on to the second card. Guess what, no freezes, but the folks in the ""it's a slow card"" camp are right! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows? I just know I don't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches. Mine were returned. Good luck, though....."
1,"Brand new out of the box my wife and I completed this puzzle, almost. All except Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. One random piece I would have blamed myself. But four? And all connected to each other? Not a coincidence. Someone at the factory really doesn't like Canada.Otherwise, a fun puzzle but not really for kids. Hope you have a stable table because the countries don't interlock so everytime you bump the table, even just a little, it's an earthquake.Took me over half the puzzle to figure out the facts and info written on the oceans were alphabetized. It was easy after that.It wasn't a total waste. It killed a rainy afternoon for my wife and I. So if you like geography and don't mind incomplete puzzles, this is the puzzle for you."
1,"I ordered two of these fan/lights. I wanted them for the fan.With the first one, the light wouldn't turn off. I had to remove the batteries when not using the fan. With the second one, the batteries only lasted two-and-a-half hours. Six batteries should have lasted longer."
2,"This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time. Nothing unusual about the story. Just light, breezy read on a Sunday afternoon.And both lead characters were likeable. Something that's harder and harder to find in the genre, IMHO."
1,I'm am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built.(in my opinion)And this book was very in accurate. The authors didn't really focus on what really happened. If I were a critic I'd give it... two thumbs WAY DOWN!
2,"Ordered four shirts since I used them for work. Same shirts from the retail store; however mine weren't in OEM packaging. Don't really care, but it's actually less packaging to throw away :)"
1,The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
1,"Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them !Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought ""Lost Souls"" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !"
2,"This book contains supreme beauty and the worst ugliness. One of the greatest works of the 20th century, one all should have a go at."
2,"I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version "" Deadly China Hero"" as I own ""Last Hero in China"" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles. This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series before OUATIC IV/V came out. Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is ""Once upon a Time in China and America"" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is. Get this DVD and try to get ""Last Hero in China"" also. In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed. This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee."
1,"I have many digital cameras, thought I would try the V705.The anti blur technology does not work very good, if at all.Doesnt support high speed SD cards.Uses Hi Compression, no way to change it = low quality Pictures.Quick Time Video is not a good mode, I would like AVISCN Custom mode is a joke.I talked to Kodak about these things and they are sorry.I will stick with a Winner, hp R817."
1,"too phoney, lots of errors in the way the movie was made, also bad lip syncing from the woman singer, they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise. One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."
1,"I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
2,Easy set up overall. Wish the bottom was lined with tarp instead of nylon.Good roomy ceiling. Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.
2,"This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed"
2,"A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it."
1,"I was really disappointed in this item. When it said Bling Bling, I expected something that had rhinestones and glamour. I got it and saw only silverlike painting on it. Not glamourous for my 2 girls. I sent it back."
2,You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.
2,This book is a must for todays generation and for those who feel in a minority. It is a great encouragement as to what a person or group of people can do if they set the mind to it and are willing to exert some effort. There have been times that my wife and I cleaned toilets for a living and we determined to do the best job we could. This book helps me to have another reason as to why we did that.
2,"Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written."
1,Everytime I think of this book I feel to yawn. I was excited to get it but I have to admit I was very bored reading it. The secret of Mr. Hogan's swing was no secret at all. It may have been back then but not now. My apologies to the author. It is just my opinion.
1,"It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
2,"Michener was drawn to stories of the Klondike gold rush whilst researching material for his voluminous Alaska, and thought this story, set dominantly in Canada, too good not to publish.It is a fictional story of a few gold seekers of the Klondike gold rush, and seeks to capture the romance, the exhilaration, the recklessness, and the overall madness of the time. It is an invigorating adventure story, however if I had just one quibble, the characters for me were a little one dimensional, and the story told in a less complex manner than it probably deserved.Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable expose of the spirit of adventure, capturing much that is part of the northern spirit of romantic escapism and self discovery."
1,Sorry Batman fans but I didn't like the movie much because it didn't show Batman till the last hour. I wanted to like it I really did but how can you people sit through and watch the first hour without Batman? The last hour was great but the first hour to me was kind of slow. I was about to get up and go home because the first hour was really boring and no Batman because it only showed Bruce Wayne being trained to be Batman. Christian Bale made an excellent Bruce Wayne and his voice fit the part as Batman but the beginning was too long and I really wanted to see Batman to show up but he didn't till the last hour. I liked the original Batman movies better but Batman Begins sucks.
1,"I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it. However, I was disappointed to find that it is a horrible and tedious book."
1,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
1,I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.
2,"This CD is a very impressive debut release, I strongly recommend it. Lead singer Delores O'Riordan's vocals are chilling and awe inspiring, and the band has the power and force to impress anyone. This band is also a tremendous live act, check them out!"
1,"I just received this stand and went to try it on my Trek 4500 and did not fit, not only did it not fit, but put some scratched on my bike :o(. So now I'm stuck with this stand that will most likely not do anything for me. It's not worth returning it. I paid $8.49 for the stand and the same for shipping. $16.98 total. It will cost me about $5 to ship it back so I will only get $3 back after it's all said and done which to me is not worth it.If you plan on using this on a Trek Mountain bike look elsewhere, it will not fit and will scratch it. :o("
2,"Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."
1,"I was so disappointed, much too small, not as described. I did not believe this was to be a large."
2,"If you're going to buy ""Turistas"" expecting to see a Hostel"" Eli Roth"" type film ...Your not going to,What you will see is a good, well acted, action packed movie with pretty people, beautiful scenery and some blood ""not much"" but the premise is not Horror it's more like the vacation from hell.Over all I liked this movie and recommend it for someone not looking for a hard core horror or gore film but just a good suspenseful action movie."
1,"Often I feel some admiration for Stephen Pastel and the way he (and Aggie and Katrina) have stayed true to their course and vision with such dogged persistence. So dogged have they been that, having been reviled for years, they're actually more respected than they've ever been.It was with some regret however that I have to report that any admiration I might have evaporates whenever I actually HEAR The Pastels - to be replaced with a feeling of ""can't they find something better to do after all these years"".Now, don't get me wrong, as Pastels go this CD is a lot better than almost anything they've ever done before - still doesn't detract from the fact that this is music by indier-than-thou smug under-achievers made for a captive audience who are, if anything, even smugger. Some people, it seems, are content to stay in their little ghettoes.The lack of talent is excusable, the lack of ambition is not."
2,"this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery."
1,"Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them."
2,Christian Bale acts out the Dark Knight as a stoic ans strong individual.Totally glad they decided to do another film.
1,it doesnt work properly it has no sound and sound will not come on yes we have it in on position dissatified the other one i bought from gundo works fine
1,"I was very disappointed with this game. I love the Resident Evil series, but this one sucked. Your AI partners are not very intelligent, they run around and don't listen to you when you need them. Normal mode is actually more like a ""hard"" mode. You can't really pause the game as it is live and the monsters come get you anyway, even when your in your inventory screen. The online option has been disabled so you can't play with other people anymore.It was just a hassle to control three people simultaneously, two of which never listen anyway.The only good thing is the scenery and surroundings. Also I liked how zombies could run after you if they wanted, instead of always dragging themselves around. Other than that, I really did not like this game."
1,i ordered this dvd for my dad's birthday. he opened it a few days later to watch and found no dvd in the case!
2,"I read the first few reviews on Clay's CD and I think that the CD is really good, because every song on there is good, not just the first three. and that's hard to find. Clay showed a lot of magic on the competition of American Idol in his voice and that was toned down on the album which wasn't so great. The songs on the album are absolutely clean, the only word that Clay uses that's sort of slang is ""baby"" and it's rarely found throughout the album. It's a very family-friendly album and I feel like I can listen to this for years to come."
2,"Great book for kids to browse before, during or after a lesson on catastorphic events. I teach 7th grade Science and it was a good book to leave around for the kids to look at."
2,"If you consider America the landmass on both sides of the equator betwixt the Atlantic and Pacific -- then American literature is truly enriched by everything that's written between Baffin Island and Cape Horn. As a young student in high school in American lit we read Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Fitzgerald -- great reading to be sure -- but only one slice of the expansive American experience. It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style"
2,works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic
1,"Which should be the only reason one would have this book in a collection.Daferring on red hair moots the ramdelgerag!

2,"This ""grabber"" is the best designed unit I've ever purchased, and I've had several different designs. I strongly recommend it for purchase by those having trouble stooping, bending, or reaching."
1,"This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
1,"I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Either the keys didn't respond at all or if you pressed one key, multiple letters appeared (""a"" became ""as""; ""q"" became ""qw"") and it was impossible to return. One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month, so it wasn't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars, I would."
2,"The Naked Clone is a thoughtful, illuminating and provocative book on a subject that implicates an extraordinary array of ethical, legal and constitutional issues. Whether or not one agrees with the author that reproductive cloning is linked to a broad network of vital personal autonomy rights, the reader is bound to come away with a much more informed and reasoned view of a highly emotional and much-misunderstood subject.Yale Kamisar, Clarence Darrow Distinguished University Professor, University of Michigan Law School."
1,"It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product."
2,"What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile."
2,i would give it 5 stars iloved that book i thought it was so goodthat i told my mom to go out and buy the book for me and now i am doing a reading fair project on it .If i could i would want to tell the author to please write anthor part to that book I did not think it should have been left off there. Well my name is Lindsey and i loved your book i am in 7th grade and asking please WRITE somemore!!!thanks Lindsey 13 Missississippi
1,"As the previous user stated, this is obviously a bootleg album. You can tell by the artwork (most notably the pixelated image on the front cover) as well as the mis-spelled songs on the back cover.I rarely ever purchase these sorts of CDs, but in this case I did only to have something in the car when I don't have my Ipod with me."
1,"Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."
2,I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
2,"Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!"
2,I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga.
1,"The computer is smart, I admit. But there are a few tricks against it. The first day of use you may be flattered, but how long are people really going to use this."
1,"I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."
1,I received this HD DVD twice. Both were defective as neither would even boot.
2,"I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."
1,"The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice."
2,"Alejandro and Martin.After reading `Romeo and Juliet', we noticed the difficult vocabulary that Shakespeare used. It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising."
2,"If you decide to buy this CD, please see the movie first. I bought this movie a long time ago for my kids and we all loved the movie, especially the music by Elton. I highly recommend the movie and the CD."
1,when I insert the disk the screen says you must attach hard drive to play. i have a 4 gig hard drive attached but it still won't play
1,"I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee. They only go about 4"" above the ankle. Very wimpy, probably wouldn't hold up to too many washes."
2,"Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift."
1,"If this is the ""best of the box"" then thank God I didn't buy the box. Most of this stuff should never have left Cobain's closet."
1,"I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."
2,"I read this book for the first time when I was 10 and I've read over again several times. The book is so worn out from me reading it, I'm going to have to get another copy soon. The writing is very detailed; I could see everything in my head as I read it. I love the characters in the book, especially Kit and Nat. They and the other characters seem very real. The story never gets boring and the ending is good too. It's one of my favorites."
2,"Go Red Sox! With this hat people will know that you are a winner, just don't wear it sideways. Same hat as at stores but a few bucks cheaper. Thx!"
2,"Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
2,"As of this writing, this great CD was on ""limited availability"". This is a CD that I can't get out of my head and break into song while listening to it. It's very moving and melodious. Yes, I love Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell but may not have bought it if I didn't read the reviews. The reviews were so upbeat that I bought the album and have it playing as I write. Please note that there is another CD called Glen Campbell ""Reunion"". Don't get that one. Get this one. The cover looks the same but this one has 24 songs on it rather than the normal number. Rated it 5 stars - you'll sing along too."
1,"I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!"
1,"For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not."
1,"If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore."
2,"When was the last time you purchased a CD and loved every song on it? That long huh? Clay Aiken's Measure of Man is filled with outstanding songs. Once you listen it will be hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to it would be between track 3 or track 10, The Way and Perfect Day. I purchased this CD after reading all the reviews, and it hasn't been out of my CD player since. This is a must have, you won't be disappointed, you will be glad you bought this one. His brilliant voice is truly remarkable!"
1,"The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again. But I won't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again. I got a new laptop."
1,"I bought my Ionic Breeye at Linens 'n Things. It doesn't work. It turns on, the light lights up, I feel a light breeze coming out ... but it doesn't clean the air. My home doesn't smell any different or fresher... Total waste of money. I am returning this unit. All this excitement for nothing!"
2,"Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too."
1,I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring.
1,"Let me start by saying there is nothing ""wrong"" with these weights. The quality is great, and the material is soft. However, when people say small...they mean it! I am a petite size 2 and they only barely fit. I actually got these for therapy use for my one-year old's ankles and these were the only one-pounders I could find. They fit my chuncky little one just perfectly."
1,"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
1,Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area. I sent it back. If the specs would have informed me ahead of time I would not have purchased this product.What a hassle. Shipped it back.
1,Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers. Relegated to cleaning after just one use.
1,I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book. Lots of code errors that make it confusing. Every one of my classmates complained about the book. The professor eventually told us to not use the book and he gave handouts he had written instead.
2,"I recently purchased this puzzle in the search for making my ""geographically challenged"" children learn more geography. Not only was this a great tool for learning, but I ended up joining in and educating myself in the process. For those parents who are worried that their children are not learning and becoming more ""worldly"", this is a perfect interactive tool that is both fun and helps feed their brain."
2,"I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."
1,"I would not recommend this product. When I plugged it in, it would not stop chirping. The directions said it might chirp ""a few times"" while powering up, but the thing chirped all day. Also, the 9 volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment. The company that I bought it from told me to just throw it away, although I did receive a full refund."
1,"I know this is a product review, but I need to bring up that I have bought over 20 pairs of these Under Armour Heatgear Compression shorts in the past, but if bought from this company, I suspect they may be fake. The material in the shorts as well as the band are rougher and seem of a lower grade material then what I've bought directly from ""Under Armour"". Two of my three pairs bought here have had the bands separate from the shorts with normal washing/wearing over a 2 month period. For reference, the oldest pair I have from ""Under Armour"" has lasted over 3 years with normal washing/wearing!!!"
1,"The magizine itself was good with the one issue they sent. I only received one issue then did not receive another. I ordered in June and now it's September. I received one Magazine. I contacted Men's Fitness Customer Support who said they would reply in 24-48 hours and it's now been a week in a half with nothing. I used to receive Men's Health and I am now going to make the switch. It's more money, but they actually show up each week. Very bad Customer Service. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. Super annoyed and disappointed with my purchase. . . .
1,"The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?"
1,"I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her ""funny stories"". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear."
2,"This wasn't the fastest ship in the world but it was shipped in great condition (which I am sure is difficult for a paper back) I love the book, I have read it several times before, just wanted to add it to my collection."
1,My baby was extremely sore after using one of these diapers for just one day. I am sending my order back because of this. No wonder it was such a great price!
2,My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!
1,"I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing."
2,"I ordered this mug warmer with a little skepticism, as I had ordered a similar product in the past only to be very disappointed with the results. The Mr. Coffee mug warmer, however, lives up to its claim and keeps my coffee nice and hot to the last drop. It's funny how something so mundane and inexpensive can bring such joy, but this one really delivers. If you hate luke warm coffee, this is your best bet!"
1,"This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
2,"A beautiful book. I love everything about it: crisp photography, nice paper, great ideas, an abundance of inspiring bon mots, lots of resources listed at the back of the book. After flipping through its pages, I wanted to jump off the sofa and begin journaling! But I didn't. I felt a little overwhelmed by the creative journal pages I saw. I just don't know where people get some of their amazing ideas. I wish my mind were half as fertile as those whose works are featured in the pages of ""Making Journals by Hand."" I will, however, continue enjoying the visual feast between its covers and hope for a divine intervention that will get me off the sofa and into the craft room to create a fabulous rememberance, just as the featured artists have done. If you like books, paper, art, rubber stamping, writing, color, cool ideas, and peeking into other people's journals, buy this book."
1,"Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad."
1,"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again."
2,"these compression shorts are quite good. the fabric is good, very good I would say. on the outside it's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance, when I'm running. it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well. only con is that I've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper, that you can put your keys in for example. that's something very useful. if these would've had that, I would've awarded 5 stars."
1,"The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
2,I found that this was very helpful learning material for young preschool aged children...you won't be disappointed in this product!!
2,This is a very handy little book. It answered many fundamental questions I had about the Buddhist philosophy. The book helped me to realize that I am a Buddhist - no matter where I am in my path.
1,"The duet with Steve Gillette ( track 18) is actually a recording of another friend of Steve Gillette's, not Jennifer Warnes . How tacky! How could RAVEN have missed that? I had to adjust the volume knob about five or six times. There is an odd ""wow"" falloff at the end of ""These Days"". Sounds like the engineer stopped the turntable manually.Jennifer Warnes was obviously not involved in the creation of this compilation. Too uneven, badly mastered."
1,"Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar!"
2,"I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. The protagonist is angry at the gods for the problems in her life. She questions their existence and condemns them for their arbitrary nature due to the difficulties that she faces.As I read this work I could see many of less desirable traits I possess in the protagonist. I, like many people I suppose have bemoaned ""why me"" and ""when oh Lord is it my turn"". Reading this book provides a mirror of such emotions.I highly recommend this work for anyone but especially for someone who might wish to indict the Gods."
1,"This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary. Also some of the information in this video is out of date. Go to the classes offered at your hospital. The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees."
1,We've watched three of the eight and find them hard going. I thought they would be historical but have found the plots to be mundane and predictable. Maybe the others will be better.
2,This book is a joy from beginning to end. Funny and insightful. I've recently reread it and found it more enjoyable than the first or second time. Her best work.
1,"I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1"" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."
2,"Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."
2,"I wanted to know how I could become a faster runner. This book gave me some new insights on running that I had never had, nor known. I was well satisfied with the book."
2,"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
1,"As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story"
2,"this is an amazing book. although it's non-fiction, it almost scares you into beleiving that you're living in their society. very thought-provoking, and very powerful. hard to believe that it was written so long ago."
2,"Besides the Introduction, I have only completely read the chapter on the Sand Creek Massacre so far, but it should be noted that the account is extraordinarily sympathetic to the acts of Chivington, his men, and the other officers, and offers a convincing rationale for the attack. It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians. All have the added fascination of being written by an author who lived at the time or within a generation of those events, and read like newspaper accounts and editorials. Recommended."
2,"Finally the American Idol 2 after-race is over. Clay has made it to the finish. So, what does his new album has to give his fans? Good music, good vocals, but no overal direction. Sometimes a listener may be wondering if this is just a vocal exercise, to show range and vocal abilities of Clay. In the words of Simon -- ""So what?"".Neverthelss, I went out and bought the album and don't regret it. I am sure that you will neither."
1,The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in.......
2,"Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it."
1,"This is the worst toy in the world. Our daughters got it on Christmas and it is the 31st of December and it's laying dead and deflated in our living room. All they need to do is press on the walls and the whole thing flips over. The tunnels become disconnected constantly. We invested in the 100 balls which are now all over the house b/c with the exception of the main hut, the two connecting rooms have no floor to contain the balls. Total disappointment."
2,I think that jennifer love hewitt is agreat actor and she shines in yhis movie. I think this is one of her better movies. I recommand this movie to everyone.
1,"You know those First Aid kits you get from the dollar store? The ones in the small, white plastic box? Well, those are better than this. Why? Well, for $8, I'll list what you get.-A white plastic box, measuring 5"" X 4"" X 1-1/2""-Eight plastic bandages, 1"" X 3-1/4"" (bootleg BandAids)-Four 2"" X 2"" gauze pads.-Four BZK towelettes.-Two single-use packs of 1% hydrocortisone cream.-Two two-tablet packsets of aspirin (325mg each tablet)-Two two-tablet packets of acetaminophen (325mg each tablet)-Roll of breathable tape, 1/2"" wide by 72"" long.-Gauze roll, 2-1/2"" wide by 24"" long.-Pair of low-quality bandage scissors.This kit isn't compact, isn't cheap, and doesn't even have good contents. Buy the dollar store kit, add some extras to it, and you'll be more prepared for less money than this kit. And it will be smaller."
2,"A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship. Found it useful at work as a reference book, plus a great read for personal relationship communications as well. Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view."
1,This product did not work in my case. It did NOT keep my Hot Tea - Hot or warm for much longer than normal. Not sure why but I wouldn't recommend! [:@]
2,"This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated..."
2,this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. I'm addicted. There is nothing sad on this album (except for the very serious song babymother {about becoming an unexpectant father}). It's a feel good CD. Even the leaveamessage track is fun.
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
1,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
1,This book in the beginning was so slow that I finished a book twice it's length before I finished the first chapter of Tess of the D'Urdubervilles.
1,Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away.
2,"The scooter has a good looking, the bateries last up to 45 minutes of continuos use but, need to change fuses evry long ride or every charging process, so far so good!"
1,"This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."
1,"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
2,"I used to watch ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" every year as a child and now my kids love to watch it. Even now, I'll sit and watch it with them-anytime of year. More importantly, this Christmas story emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas-something I'm happy to have my children watching."
1,When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else. very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again.
1,What a crap film this is!Some films are so bad that they are funny. This isn't one of them. It's just plain bad.I have nothing more to say on the subject cept make sure that your holding a loaded gun to your head before you start watching this film.That way you can put yourself out of your misery in the fastest possible way.
2,"I had two computers, windows 2000 and windows XP. Windows XP recognized the device immediately, but windows 2000 took me 3 hours to download SP3 to upgrade my system( follow the instruction on the manual). It works on windows 2000, too.The best thing about this product is that it is also a writer. You can use it as an USB drive with your CF/SM card in. I use it to transfer large files between my two computers, instead of a floppy or USB pen drive( which I planned to buy, but not any more).BTW, its speed is USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. Though it is fast enough, it is better if it is USB2.0."
2,"The author eases the reader into intermediate topics, which are carefully explained. I highly recommend this book to people who have thoroughly completed books like Visual Basic .NET Step by Step."
1,Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.
1,"I have always used huggies, but the price was great on these pampers and hospitals use them so I figured they must be great. First, they leak and separate when wet. I put them on my baby at night and he wakes up with wet clothes. When walking around the gell is saggy and it separates into sagging pockets. These diapers are of the same quality as a noname brand of diaper...they really suck and I can't wait to get rid of them but its going slow since I ordered 192 of them!!!!!!!"
1,I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
2,I have been using diapers for my lil one for ten months now and I love pampers the most. One huge factor was the over night diaper was not leacking and another the gel that forms once the diaper is wet does not come out. When I used huggies the diaper felt very very wet and the gel was all over her bottom once she would wake up.
1,"I just got the GoFit ball. It came with a handbook with excercise options. An instruction DVD on using the ball, a hand pump and a white plastic piece I assume it related to the pump or plug to the ball. The ball already has a similiar white plug in place. There are NO instructions on how to get the ball inflated. The pump does not fit into where I assume to pump air into it. No matter what Itry I can not get the ball to take any air. If I could inflate the darn ball, I would be able to rate its performance. If you can not get air into it, it is completely useless."
1,I received the wrong book in the mail. The right book needs to be sent. Still need the right copy
1,"Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's ""Newspeak"" should include these additions: ""Propaganda is Truth""; ""Truth is Absolute""; ""Freedom springs from Fear""; ""Extremism is Virtue."" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as ""The Crying of Lot 49."" At least IT has the virtue of being well written."
1,"I would not buy this again - it teaches a non-standard supposedly ""new"" methof of casting"
1,Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore.
1,"This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
1,"The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
2,"Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!"
1,"I'm not sure what the plot was for this movie, I really don't know what i got the movie either maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don't know but wasn't all that great."
1,"I guess they will put out a greatest hits album for about anybody now. This ""supergroup"" put out 2 albums and really had only one big hit in ""High Enough"". It is here and there are a few other good tracks, but nothing to write home about. This is the work that Tommy Shaw did after his first falling out with Dennis DeYoung and it has influenced him ever since. this band is a major reason why STYX is without DeYoung and the joke of the classic rock world today."
1,"Once again a remake takes a ""Classic"" film ""The Haunting""(the best haunted house movie ever) and retooled it as an effects driven mess. Did they even watch the original or read the wonderful novel? Surely not if this is what they came up with. All the subtler aspects of the first are thrown out in favor of the mind numbing CGI effects. The result is one big dud of a ""thriller"". The cast is good but wasted as the makers seem more intent on showing us what they can do with CGI rather than giving us a true ""chiller"" like the better than ever original was.All in all, not even a nice try!!!"
2,Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve.
2,They came in time. Look fwd for the baby soon! This June will be diaper time for us. The price is very good also.
2,"My mom had the original of this book from when she was a child and she read it to me when I was young. It is almost impossible to find a copy of the original these days so I was thrilled that there is a new version available. I wish it were not abridged, but it still tells the wonderful tale of the Little Squeegy Bug, Lamplighter of the Skies. My daughter will grow up with this treasure as well."
1,Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
1,"The section on humor is very good, but if you want to improve your presentation skills, it's no point reading a big book, you have to practice to improve.This book could have been more useful if it were more concise."
2,"These Anaheim boys know how to rock my world. Their music is upbeat, fun and easy to dance to. I definitely recommend checking it out and while you're at it, check out their website (mysuperhero.com) If you like music with style you'll love My Superhero!!!"
1,"Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short."
2,"Great stuff and it works fast and easy. Not meant to refinish your kitchen, this is for Furniture only. Wear gloves and use outside or in a well ventilated area."
2,This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism.
1,"This is a huge diappointment. The producers of this CD should be publicly flogged. Clay's fans love his strong, booming voice and ability to pound out ballads. You'll hear NONE of that on this CD. I am amazed that producers with decades of experience wouldn't understand that fans want to hear the full range of Clay's voice. Instead, what you will hear are a bunch of sappy, run of the mill pop tunes that will uninspire. Save your money and buy some old Barry Manilow cd's. At least you'll get what you are paying for. Let's hope, on his next CD, that Clay is allowed to sing the way we all know that he can."
2,no problems whatsoeverI remember why I love the show so muchthis DVD is much cheaper here than at other retailersI wonder why though only 6 episodes on the 1st season...maybe they needed for it to catch onthats understandablethere's a great memorial feature for John Ritter too
2,"These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras?"
2,"I appreciate the books a great deal. They are wonderful tools for improving communication, which is something we all need, and especially when the stakes are high. Great book."
1,The book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school. This version Bored me to tears.
1,"Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book."
2,"When yet another VCR died on me, I decided it was time to move on up to digital. I have regular (analog) cable, no cable box. This unit is perfect. It easily replaces both of my VCR's and allows me to record two different programs at the same time. I can even watch something else that was previously recorded at the same time! Set up was very easy, the only downside for me was that my TV is not located near a phone jack, but that was pretty easily worked around. All in all, it has performed exactly as advertised and has made me wonder what took me so long!!"
1,"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."
2,"This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!"
2,I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
2,"The cheapest way you can buy baby diapers, and you don't have to sweat it, it will come to your front door. Baby diaper shopping nirvana."
1,"This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of ""make the movie themselves"" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be ""About"" the ""last days"" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."
1,"This film is amazing. However, don't buy it if you want an english dub. Despite the claim in the product description, there is no dub on this copy."
2,This was the 2nd time I've read this classic book. I was always held within the pages of intimacy of interest.
1,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
1,"I thought I might be finding a low priced bargain here, but to much alto and not enough tenor here for me ...This CD seems to be a Kenny G knock off ... And while I'm not a great fan of alto, Kenny G does have a way with it that elicits some sweet and often times soothing sounds (I especially like his Christmas sounds) ... Not so with Parker's as his alto comes out a little ""tin-ny"" sounding ... If I'm allowed by Amazon let me recommend Sony's ""Sax For Lovers"" or # 32. Jazz Record's ""Jazz for When You're Alone"" if you want to strike a really jazzy soft-sax-love mood ... They're both serious ""soft jazz"" tenor sax CD's by serious tenor sax artists who will get the ""gig"" done."
1,"Apparently, the only path to wisdom and a life packed with acts of kindness is arse freezing and sword and/or kickboxing tricks.Ridiculous movie designed for brainless pimpled teenagers.Nauseating philosophy wrapping grandiloquent dialogues.At least the Rambo suite was honest entertainment."
1,It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older.
2,"Good read for middle school kids as a homeschool or supplemental read. I found it interesting that Booker T advocates a clean lifestyle which is what so many of our current male youth need to learn - hard work, morality and education. A great man."
1,"This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics."
1,"This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and sound, but it is incredibly hard to play. The controls are demented, the camera viewpoints imbecilic. If they had spent a small amount more on making this game playable, it would have been a smash hit. As it stands, this game is not worth the sticker price. I am a long time Tomb Raider fan and I will probably still play this game, but it is just not much fun at all."
1,"As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying."
2,"Some say this book is responsible for the renewed interest in Richard III. Whether true or not, it certainly peaked my curiosity.It's chock full of history. But I have one word of caution: If you know nothing about the Wars of the Roses, the reign of Edward IV or Richard III, I recommend you first read Sharon Kay Penman's THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR. Without a good foundation in the history of the times, you'll miss much of the subtle references.On the other hand, the unveiling of Richard III (biased in favor of the man) appears secondary to the point of the book. Rather, I think Tey meant to call historians to task. If history were written after proper (or legal) interpretation of the evidence at hand, she seems to contend, it might prove a whole lot more accurate."
2,"I HAD TWINS IN MAY OF 99. AND THE HELPED ME VERY MUCH. WITH EVERY QUESTION I EVER HAD. I STRONGELY ENCOURGE EVERY MOTHER EXPECTING TWINS TO READ. AND ALSO TO REMEMBER, YOU ARE EXPECTING 2 BABIES, PLEASE TAKE IT EASY. I DID TAKE IT EASY~BUT I WAS ONE THAT LOST MINE AT 21.5 WEEKS. THANKS ELIZABETH ~ IT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME. JENNIFER~MOTHER OF SAMANTHA & TRAVIS"
1,I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
1,"The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good."
2,works amazing in my car without any problems. Lights up a bright blue when charging and actually chargers my phone up.
1,"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."
1,"When you put it standing up on its legs, it falls down. A friend of mine has one. He tried repeatedly to get it to stand up, but it just fell down with the slightest touch! After a while we were realy fed up. It was over $39.00!"
2,These cups are easy to clean and drink from. the color is excellent.A worthy addition to your home.
1,The package said it contains threaded nozzle for bicycle hand pump. It do miss that in the package. I guess i received the used product.I would not recommend this product.
1,"This album absolutely sucked. They are still living off of Dr. Dre's scraps from '94. Seriously ever since Snoop sold out and became some wanna be 1970's style pimp, he has dropped off the map as far as importance to the rap game. Kurupt and Daz still have a little bit in the tank, but not enough to warrant buying this album. Anyone who says this album is good is only kidding themselves. Best advice: Keep away from this one and buy something else."
2,"I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS."
2,"This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck. If you overlook those issues, it is a very good book"
1,"I ordered this sight unseen, and unfortunately cannot recommend other similar dictionaries. However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work. When I return to the market for such a dictionary, I will search for better option."
1,"but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not ""fluid."" In other words, the necklace would ""flip"" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the ""topaz.""I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18"" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin."
2,"This product works great and looks good too. This is my second (for my wifes), I have had mine for almost 10 months with no problems."
1,"This book was one of the worst I have ever read. I thought it was going to be inspiring on the life of Tiny Tim from The Christmas Carol story. Instead, it was raunchy, and totally boring. Shame on the reviewers who lured our book club with their praise of this book for the Christmas season. Couldn't even finish it - and I have never not finished a book in over 30 years. Blah!"
1,"Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
1,"I don't know what all the hype is about. In my opinion Clay Aiken is a little overrated. He does have a powerful voice; however, the CD is mostly ballads and all of the songs sound basically the same, with the exception of Invisible which is a little creepy since it seems to be about a stalker. If you like ballads I would stick with Josh Groban."
1,"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it really never did. There was a total lack of character development, and even less plot development. I'm buying the second book to see if the characters die.."
2,I play Hand and Foot every other week and the four of us love using these. You get 13 cards and it is very handy to have.
2,"Toxicity is possibly the greatest CD in history in my opinion. Their song, Bounce, woul make Frank Zappa very proud. Political bands are quite scarce these days, mostly rock music today consists of sex, drugs, and pushing down old people. Prison Songs is widely known for its lyrics ...and law enforcemnt decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences!... System of a Down out-weirded everyone for this year I think, with their strange looks and wild performances. This is not a CD you would want to pass up! go see them at the Ozzfest!"
1,"This is a *postcard* book. The Amazon description does not mention this particular bit of information. I was expecting *text* and art, but this is not what I received. Beautiful art, but--again--not what I had expected."
1,Ray J Ray j Ray j whats goin on this album is crap theres about 3 songs with good beats on em but ray j's vocals just screw them up. theres nothing great about this album or ray j.
2,"This Cd is 2nd only to Twelve Play! I love it. I remember hearing it back in 2001. It was then and still is hot. I only deducted one star because a few songs on Cd were scratched. My Cd player had been cleaned with a laser disc cleaner beforehand, I did not mishandle the Cd. I even cleaned it... Yes scratched ...so that kinda sucks, but Tp2 is still a great Cd , and the fact that Cd was scratched on a few songs is no fault of R Kelly! I'm still happy I purchased it for my collection... I may have to repurchase in future so that I can enjoy every single song, but still enjoyed most songs!"
1,"I was there for two years, there are very few if any real facts in this movie, on the Extras Disc the advisers and statisticians did not tell the truth...The movie is a lie!"
2,"The acting and aircraft sequences are very good. I enjoyed the movie, but if it is based on a true story, then I would have to read it. I found the ending a bit ""hoakey"". If you like WWI movies, like ""The Blue Max"", you will enjoy this one."
1,Do not order this DVD. It does not work. The HD player will tell you that it cannot load it (error message) after 10 minutes of trying. Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.
1,William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!
1,"It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
2,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
2,I was lucky to get this book as a free kindle edition. I tore through it and have ordered the second book. It is extremely well written with amazing detail.
1,"I purchased three of these and within 1-2 months, ALL three of them ""broke"". The seams on two of the beds broke, leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart..Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for. After contacting the company and starting the refund process, I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I wouldn't be able to receive a refund. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yes, the beds are $35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but can't believe how cheaply they are made. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck!"
2,"It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
1,"Since when did Amazon have the legal right to sell bootleg CD's? I purchased this cd so I can listen to it in the car, ( I have had it on wax for 20 years)The CD is a CDR... When did Amazon buy the licensing rights to Music of Life? They are charging people $15.00 for a bunch of MP3's burnt on to a CD lmao. I give it one star because it is a CDR.."
1,I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
1,"In 1967 and 1968, I was squad leader in Vietnam in the 25th Infantry Division. This is yet another Hollywood movie that portrays Vietnam combat vets as perverts, and heartless killers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. War is brutal and ugly and the Vietnam War was no exception, but young Americans served honorably in Vietnam as Americans have in other wars. Yes, these things may have happened, but they were the exception and not the rule. It seems that most of the movies I've seen focus on the same negative themes. If you REALLY want to know what the war was like, the only DVD I could fully recommend is ""Dear America, Letters Home from Vietnam"". This DVD contains actual Vietnam War footage, which is mixed with letters home read by Tom Berenger, Robin Williams, Robert Deniro, Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen and many others. Please see this video if you really want to begin to understand what combat vets experienced and how they conducted themselves."
2,"These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track (33342). The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines (like the mighty red battery-powered engine) to drive through the curves. However, if the tracks are laid without too many ""bumps"" at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well."
2,"What I remember about eighties music was a few good singles here and there with a nice sound but rubbish albums. Darkdancer is like all the good bits of the 80s with better production and done by someone with some musical talent. Although there's some good pop songs on this album, others unfurl subtlely, even majestically. Nostalgia aside, what makes the record good is the music itself. Now that I think of it, there's loads of 80s compilations coming out at the moment. I hope this doesn't mean a full-on revival is on the cards. The charts in the 1980s were poor. That's that. It's not clever to like it now; at least Le Conte or whatever his name is has some skill so I'll let him off. A good albom. Wel dun!"
2,A spectacular summary of future plans for Mars exploration and colonization. I hope all will see this. You should buy the DVD and watch it when it dosen't interfere with other TV shows on commercial TV.It is worth it!
2,"We've tried close to every brand of diaper available - even store brands. We've had a lot of success with Pampers diapers. Our daughter is tall for her age and has a longer torso. With some diapers it is difficult to find one that fits high enough, preventing leaks. These seem to fit her well, no leaks! Also, for as thin as they are, they seem to be very aborbent.We had been using Costco's Kirkland brand diapers because they were a good value diaper, and were not unhappy with them. However, after I enrolled in the 'Amazon Mom' program, I am able to get these diapers shipped to my door on the schedule I choose, free shipping, for less than I was able to buy the same quantity of Costco's brand. Impressive! We're able to get a quality, brand-name diaper at a big-box-store price.Since enrolling in the program, we have switched back to Pampers and are very pleased!"
2,"I think Izzy is very talented and I'm glad he's using his talent for Kingdom music. I didn't always feel like he gave his all in every song but the lyrics were great and a few songs really caught my ear. I can't say that it's my favorite cd, but I think it's a great way to round out any Christian's cd collection. I hope to see more from this artist."
1,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
2,"""The Witch"" is one of my favorite epiosdes, Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy) is a wonderful actress.""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" is also a wonderful episode, and Velvet Chain (the band who play at the Bronze) are awesome.Its a great deal, so get it now!"
2,"I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =)."
2,"I have tried different brands like Luvs, Huggies, and others but they cannot compare to Pampers baby dry! These diapers DO NOT leak and blowouts are a thing of the past! My child sleeps for 13+ hours a night and she wakes up dry."
2,"I will admit to being a bit overwhelmed in the beginning since it jumped in with all these characters and all this action, but it did not take me long to settle down comfortably in the plot. I adored how Crusie allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. The characters had a wonderful blend of humor, intelligence, and chemistry. Also, the plot was interesting and had a few twists and turns, but nothing that seemed outlandishly implausible."
2,"We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose."
2,"Dr. Richard Eby has experienced many miracles in his life. But his story of life after death changed my life. He falls off a balcony and splits his head open. They rush him to the hospital and thinking he is dead they sew his head up without cleaning the wound. God shows him a glimpse of heaven. Afterwards he cannot remember the the fall. Later God lets him relive the fall to be able to tell others about the experience. A few years later while visiting the Holy Land. He enters the Tomb of Lazarus and everything goes dark. God speaks to him and tells him that he showed him a glimpse of heaven, now he will show him a glimpse of hell. His story is amazing! I saw him on a television show telling his story in 1979. I then went out and bought his book. It gave me the desire to start reading my Bible. Which is the greatest book of all!"
2,The book binding is in the opposite direction of the pages!! I'm trying not to let it detract from the content of the book.
2,"Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued."
1,"Having watched Clay really get deep in his singing on American Idol, I expected much more from him than he delivers on this CD. The arrangements are weak, his singing is shallow, and the songs all sound the same. For a person of such depth and range in his songs, this is a very poor compilation. I am vastly disappointed."
2,"A former ""diplobrat"" who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden's description of a child's first encounter with France. The effect of their foreign adventure on each family member develops along with an excellent plot (not usually Godden's strong point). Even better than the character descriptions is the evocation of French country life at its most seductive -- ""next best to being there."""
2,"I bought that Ghost face Album a month ago and in all actuallity that is one of the best album I've got in a while. From the intro it was tight, I'm a fan of the wu no matter what people say about them. I respect those who don't bend to trends, be leaders not followers. Toney does his thing on this one with lines like"" I keep Big Shurly on my side so what's happen. Get the he'll out of here what other dude would say some ish like that. The album touch mad topic from love to runnin' from them folks. In closing all I got to say is to all those that hold the wu down keep doing it, true Mcin' is over here."
1,"Eric Flint calls this an ""oddball volume"" and a ""cross between a traditional anthology and a novel"" in the preface. I found it a bewildering mishmash, even the wrap up section at the end. The storyline jumps between characters and locations frequently, and the timeline jumps back and forth as well. The number of characters in play is astounding, and most of them are not the main 1632 characters. It was just plain hard to follow, and therefore hard to fully enjoy. For newbies, this is a definite DO NOT BUY. If you are a 1632 series experienced reader, go ahead, but be forewarned that this one falls a little short."
2,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"
2,"Wow. this movie is definitely one that should be watched. so sad. so many people deceived.""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.Ye shall know them by their fruits."" Matthew 7:15-16"
1,"Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
2,"i usally buy these boots from famous footwear and pay like 80 to 90 bucks so i found them on amazon alot cheaper, thanks"
2,once again studs has nailed it inspirational timely and speaks to me today as it did years ago how i miss him but his words are still alive today
2,"This group was underrated in the US. They had all the jams. Denise, Doris, and Lorraine were so cute. Great stuff!"
2,"This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
1,"Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie."
1,"I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I'm missing out on something. The Zoe bars are a major disappointment. The roof of my mouth feels like it is coated with a grainy wax when I finish eating the bars. Unless you enjoy wax, spend your money on many good alternative bars and skip the Zoe's."
2,YES I TOO HAD TO SWITCH I HATE THE CRUISERS WITH DRY MAX I TRIED HUGGIES BUT MY BABYS PRIVETS WOULD STINK IN HUGGIES SO I NOW AM USING BABY DRY AND MY SON SMELLS FRESH IAM STILL INFURIATED WITH PAMPERS FOR CHANGING THE CRUISERS AND I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO BUY ANY MORE OF THEIR PRODUCTS BUT I CANT HAVE STINKY PRIVETS I WAS GOING TO SWITCH TO LUVS BUT LUVS AND PAMPERS ARE BOTH MADE BY PROCTOR AND GAMBLE SO FOR NOW I WILL BE USING BABY DRY BUT MY CHILDREN STILL WAKE UP WET
2,"Batman Begins is my favorite movie of all time. I watched it 10 times in the theater and I am going to buy a big screen tv for the dvd. Every young man should watch this movie as it features an all star father figure cast of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the immortal Liam Neeson. Watch as they mold an angry young man into a legend. Not to be overlooked is rising star Cillian Murphy as he plays the creepy Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow. After the disastrous Batman & Robin in 1997, this is the movie Batman fans have dreamed about for years."
2,"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."
2,I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.
2,"Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of."
1,This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.
1,"Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot."
2,"It isn't the best movie in the world, but it is definitely one that should be watched in HD with Surround Sound. It is a must for my library."
1,"Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"
1,"So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
2,"Why people are absolutely clobbering this movie, I don't know. As a guess, I would say that the title makes you think of the video games, but this is aboslutely *nothing* like the video games, be warned of that from the outset. However if (unlike many others) you can get around the fact that it is completely out of the ordinary for the mario universe, you'll be rewarded to find a great movie with a quite interesting story. I only dock this a star because of the expectations issue. This has no business having ""Mario Bros."" in the title, but otherwise highly recommended :)"
2,"The Spongebob Movie was just what I expected. AWESOME! Patrick was funny, Spongebob was funny... It is a Spongebob fans must-see movie!"
1,"To make this as quick and as painless as possible, the movie was a huge letdown. Keanu Reeves look like he was just going though the motions here and delivers a rather stale performance that is the worse one in the entire film and that's a great feet considering that Shia LaBeouf, gives a painfully unfunny performance as his pet sidekick. Rachel Weisz is great but she's stuck with Keanu way too much and she would have been much lead than he was because she at least made you care about what was happening with the film while Keanu was just playing his Neo character again. Djmon Hounsou is fine but wasted in a bit part and Peter Stormare is criminally underused in a cameo.The special effects are great but there is really no story to be told and the script is pretty bad in some parts.Avoid."
2,"I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9"" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes..."
2,"I have a 2006 ford f350 super duty with the 6.0 ltr which is known for starting hard in the winter . the thought of leaving the 1000 watt heater plugged in all the time made me nuts, this timer works great and very easy to set up .with the higher wattage my heater drawls it works great. two thumbs up for the price!"
2,"If you want space to carry your music everywhere...this is your device. For all those reviews about the cover, now the cover included with the player has window to the screen, no need to take the player out of the case, unless you are changing the battery. A USB cable is included...no extra purchase. And the fact that you can copy the music back to your computer is a plus for me. The buttons takes a little getting use to it, but for almost $200 less, I can deal with it. The software is easy to learn, and the fact that you can replace the battery with ease...big plus..."
2,"Works great as an overnight diaper. No leaks, so my baby doesn't wake up wet and crying in the middle of the night."
1,"This movie is the worst Van Damme movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I found myself drifting in and out of deep sleeps while I was watching this boring film. Please, do not waste your time or money in renting or buying this movie. It has only one ""Van Damme"" style fight scene throughout the whole movie. Not his best, his worst."
2,Bought this to wear as a guy in a dress on Halloween.... I was Barbie. It fit well and I received numerous compliments and questions as to wear I purchased it.
2,"Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. I use the locks on other items, works great holding my hat on in windy weather."
2,"This CD is typical of what your would expect from Idle Cure, good, old fashioned rock 'n' roll with Christian tones and themes. The music is inspirational and makes you feel good as you listen to it. I think any Christian rock fan would enjoy this. Idle Cure has a unigue sound that sets them apart from other bands. Give it a listen- you will like it."
2,"The singers are very good, both of them has a very nice voice and they are talented singer. I enjoy listening this music very much"
1,"I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
1,I purchased the next size up for my son for nighttime. I have never had a leak this badly before where it went up his chest and sides. I'm going to try the Huggies nighttime diapers.
1,"This item will not work with Tivo Basic (the Tivo service included on some Pioneer and Toshiba boxes). We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo. This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus. You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic, which is required to get this to work. Unfortunately, Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic, so it costs extra. Since we already paid a lot for the box (equal to a lifetime membership), we didn't want to do that again and sent it back, so I can't really attest to its functionality or ease of use (although it was a huge pain to figure out why we didn't have a MAK...that took some serious googling since they don't make our box anymore)."
2,This was a wondeful process. I would buy from Amazon again and again. It is especially great for the older hard to find movies.If anyone knows how to find the movie Madame X with Lana Turner and John Forsyth let me know. I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Thanks again
2,"I have read some of the reviews and it appears to me that the ones who don't like this book are the children who had to read it. First of all this book is not written for each state, so you will have to check on your own state or county laws along with this book. As for this book not helping you pass the ""TEST"". Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the ""TEST"", which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them. But we as adults must continue the teach, and hope that some of what they read sinks in. When dealing with driving a vehicle, learning by experience a lot of times ends up to late. This book doesn't teach you how to pass the ""TEST"" it teaches you how to be a better driver, something we all need to be..."
2,"...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't."
1,"To be honest, I was quite unimpressed with this book. It was a bit interesting, but other than a chapter on being up/down the exchange, it was all things that I may never use in a real game. As well, it didn't provide as many examples of each type of Material unbalance as I'd like, and, though I like Andrew Soltis as an author, his writing wasn't his best here."
1,"Hello, I was given this CD by a co-worker who wanted to Clay Forward with proceeds to go to the Aiken Foundation. I tried to be objective and as one who listens avidly to Streisand, Groban, and I am also a New Yorker who attends Broadway Plays, and the Opera, I was very optimistic. Clay Aiken is still young and has time to develop his voice. I was not impressed by this disc at all. It is light and popsy and not a very good first showing. I wish this young man luck in the future, he'll need it unless he gets better production help. If not, maybe I will catch him in one of the Broadway shows that I attend. He is at least THAT good.Thanks for the CD Sylvia."
1,"It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard."
2,I like this movie. I like the part when Moby Dick attacks. I think the captain is weird.
2,"It is a very fair tribute to Celia. It's a shame that it was done so late when she wasn't abble to sing as she used to. The singers do well, but it leaves a sad taste to see Celia just sitting and listen to her songs being interpretated by others."
2,"While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective."
2,"I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day. She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago. She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes. This is her favorite toy."
1,"This book was 9th grade honors English required reading...our teachers beat it to death, and it was really awful anyway. The book was boring, pointless, and plotless, until towards the end. I would not reccommed it."
2,"The great differential in this metal band from Finland is the presence of a female singer. Other than this, the keyboarder writes all the songs, which is also unusual in a metal band. Because NIGHTWISH is metal, sheer European metal, but with style and precision. There's no great concern with fast guitar solos, just good music being played. But this CD shows clearly that they have evoluted. This is much better than "" ANGELS FALL FIRST""."
1,Opened the First Season to play and 3 of the discs fell out of the packaging and were scratched. Trying to put the discs back is a real challenge. This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery). I am returning all seasons as it is not worth having packaging that is useless.
2,I bought this for a backup power for our company data center. It has come in handy a couple of times and it works great. We have not used the radio or the Power utlity much but all features work well enough. I am happy with the Black and Decker lantern and would recommend it.
2,"The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting."
2,"THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME ALOT OF THE ACTORS ARE YOUNG, I LOVED THE EFFECTS, FOR A OLDER MOVIE IT HAD SOME AWESOME UPGRADES. I AM SO GLAD I OWN IT."
1,"How many times have they release the same 10 songs? I used to really like Styx and I even enjoyed parts of their last two albums (um... let me be clear here... the last two albums that weren't live albums or compilations or Styx-as-cover-band-garbage.) I actually ""stalk"" this band waiting for them to put out some more music, and I get my hopes up every time there is something new, but 99% of the time they've just released old songs AGAIN. I don't know who is buying these same songs AGAIN, but will you please quit so they'll actually have to put out some new music to make any money?"
2,My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time
1,"Just when I thought it could get any worse than Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio or Dance of Death tour dvds, the Scorpions appeared to have hired the same camera, film and editing crew of those aforementioned releases. A great performance no doubt but the editing makes this unwatchable. Just an overpriced dvd to play when the tube is turned off."
1,"Buyer beware. This is a version with a feel good hollywood formula ending. It is not the original, it was redone to give the US viewers a somewhat happy and typical USA horror ending / resolution, (pretty symbolic of our countries state I would say). Get the European version. I bought this thing w/o realizing they redid it, now I am buying the original---"
1,"I don't think this guy sucks completely but he is pretty overrated. I read articles saying that he is the next Elvis Presley. Hahahaha, that's funny. I can see him being the next Richard Marx but he's never gonna be up there with the king.Triumph The Insult Comic Dog said it best...""Ruben or Clay, which one to pick? It's like choosing what puddle of vomit to lick""."
2,"Watch it you will enjoy it. I not a fan of the Stargate series, but I enjoyed how this cleaver concept was exercuted in this self contained episode."
2,"A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over."
1,"I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works."
1,"Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
2,"I have a 20 year old Kenwood receiver that only has inputs for two pairs of speakers. However, I wanted to hook up not only one pair of indoor speakers and one pair of outdoor speakers (patio) but also a new pair of outdoor speakers for a screened-in porch. As well I wanted to be able to use a single hook up to play my iPod on all sets of speakers. So I saw that this unit had not only an ability to power additional speakers but also an ability to do so in such a way that I could use this unit as an input to the Kenwood receiver. I simply wired the new speakers to the new AudioSource AMP-100 and used a basic RCA cable to connect the output line of the AMP to the Phono input of the receiver and presto it all works like a charm. This works exactly as I expected and I love having this product."
2,"I had a USB wireless adapter that got 50-60% signal strength. This this adapter, I get around 90%. I've absolutely no problems with this card and have been impressed by it's performance."
2,"A must have for your collection, It has both the original and the second version of it. Highly recommend, nothing better than getting warm around the holidays and watching this one."
1,"If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
2,"Mr. Hartley has given us a book of our times. He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets."
2,"I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. Good quality and a fair price."
1,"Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"
1,"I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
2,"This is a book that addresses fundimental issues of what it takes to achieve, what it takes to overcome and how valuable the ethics of hard work and education. Mr. Washington demonstates pragmatism in the universal plight, plus or minus, of arriving in time in our package, whatever it is, and progressing through persistance and acknowledging the heart of his humanity."
1,"This machine looks good and made good coffee for about a year. The dripstop mechanism was very tempermental and did not always work well, causing big messes on the counter if we did not watch it carefully. However, that will no longer be a problem as the heating element died today. I have older coffee makers that still work after 20 years. This was a BIG disappointment."
1,Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!
1,iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well.
2,"This charger is much sturdier than the mac version (which my cat chewed through in a matter of days). I'd read another review that said this adapter didn't work on the aluminum PowerBooks, but it works great for mine. In addition, the product arrived in about one day. I ordered it on a Friday morning and received it on Saturday before noon. I would highly reccomend this product."
2,"This movie is great! Nick Cage when he was younger and Cher when she was...well...anyhow...they both look great and the story is clever and well built on the same grounds as La Boheme, a Lover's classic Opera tale. Cameos by a lot of great actors of our time. The roots of the Catholic Italians in New York is intriging...and the whole issue of age and it's timelessness...Definitely one for the collection!"
1,"it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night."
2,"The world's best performers together. I guess the only one missing was Peter Gabriel, but oh well, he missed it.Extremely recommendable."
1,HAD A PAIR OF NIKE SHOX THAT THE SOLE HAD SEPARATED SOME. PURCHASED SHOE GOO. APPLIED AND CLAMPED FOR 48HRS. ONCE CLAMP REMOVED SOLE SEPARATED IMMEDIATELY. GOO DOES NOT WORK!!!!!
2,"At the beginning of the movie, I was afraid about how Bruce Wayne become The BATMAN. But Christian Bale is since Michael Keaton, the only who can brought this legend come true.The screenplay is uncredible and very complete. You can forget everything you've seen before. BATMAN BEGINS is now the new reference in Super heroes movies. Spider-man, you don't have the lead anymore."
2,"I haven't seen this on home video, but on TV recently, which I thought was great, except that there wasn't so much based on the game. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are Mario and Luigi, which is OK. There is a Princess named Daisy, not Toadstool. King Koopa is human, not a reptile. Also, there were no fire flowers nor were there any invincibility stars. If you like the games, you will love this movie. I hope to see it on DVD."
2,"This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice."
1,"The item's photo is for the new Estes parachute designed to look like chutes from the 60's. The chute was solid red, not the classic checkerboard design. Returned for refund."
2,"This album is innovative and fun, blending various styles to create one slick and catchy sound. It is a refreshing change to bland Strokes-wannabies and the same old homogenised Fiddy/G-Unit output and what a surprise you Yanks don't seem to understand or appreciate it! I've even read reviews on here criticising her accent - SHE'S FOREIGN WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? I've read other reviews attacking her political agenda - WHAT DO FIDDY AND HIS GOONS RAP ABOUT??? Guns, Beatches and Drugs that's what!!!! At least MIA has something intelligent to say. Isn't freedom of speech a constitutional right for you guys anyway??? Open your ears and your wallet and buy a copy now!!!"
1,"My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in ""SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak"". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."
2,"Telemann: Sinfonia spirituosa; String Concertos is a recording under the direction Reinhard Geoebel leading the Musica Antiqua Kln on this Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording from 2002. It contains a well-written essay entitled ""Georg Phillip Tellemann: A Musician Abreast Of The Times"" written by Richard Goebel and translated into English by Richard Evidon. The performance by Musica Antiqua Kln is nothing short of splendid and I thorougly enjoy this recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."
1,"I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it."
2,"I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."
1,I used them just for a few days . i bought a big box and put them on craigslist for baby dry lovers. but i will not recommend any one to usethem. Every time i had to change layers of clothing with diaper. bad on laundry budget.
1,Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. Plus the guy can't sing he sounds like he is whining. Stay away from this song!!
1,"Useless, just a junk kit. Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item. If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it, I would refuse it! Junk!"
2,"This CD is composed of 12 wonderful pop ballads, that exploit the breadth and depth of Clay Aiken's amazing vocal talent. From the opening song, ""Invisible"", to the pop-country tune, ""The Way"", the Beatle-esque ""Shine"", ""This is The Night"", and the final song, ""Touch"" (suprisingly, a Justin Timberlake-style song which Clay makes his own), this CD is pure ear candy. Kudos to the producer and those behind the scenes who pulled together this entire set of songs for Clay's debut CD. It is fresh and pure enjoyment."
2,"I read the reviews for this product and purchased. I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake. I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably. For me if I don't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don't feel it's working. The thing I like the most about it is that's it's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top. Body hugging tops excluded, of course. I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town."
1,"This band absolutely sucks. All their songs sound the same the lead singer can't sing and he wants to be like the lead singer from Godsmack, but at least Godsmack makes a good sound. System of a Down makes a putrid sound and everytime I hear their song I want to puke."
1,"I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly."
2,"I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever."
1,"I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade."
1,"This review is ONLY for the edition noted above. Most editions of this book are facsimiles of earlier editions. You can download the book from google for free. Exact same text and layout. I ordered this item (the ASIN 1604241438 version) twice at $4.96 (I see now its about $15) and both times the cover arrived rather bent. The reprint is worth 5 dollars, because it is just a bound version of the PDF you could download from google."
2,"My whole family is fighting over this gem! Granted, 20Q misses some easy ones, and gets some really hard ones, but it is one of the funnest things I have played in a while. A must have for long trips. My only problem is that it is flimsy."
2,"According to Leach, corporations, academia and government have all worked to disengage Americans from their places of nurture so that Americans and indeed the whole world will travel, consume, and search continually for new things and experiences to buy. Upon reflection, I ask myself how Professor Leach convinced me that one-size-fits-all containers (for trains and trucks) supports his thesis."
1,I was using swaddlers (pampers yellow box) and then decided to try these baby-dry (pampers green box. My 5 month old is in a size 2 but when I ordered size 2 in the baby-dry they were to small even though she was still in the weight range (15lbs) they give on the box. So my advise is that the baby-dry pampers run small.
2,"Pros: Sturdy, Sleek Finish.Cons: Difficult to work in, loud fans.This is a neat little addition to the living room. When the box arrived I was stunned at how big this box was, I guess in my mind I pictured it a bit smaller. It's about the size of a toaster oven. There is definitely a certain order in which the parts need to be assembled. I would suggest you pick up a modular power supply because cable management in this not so little guy is a royal pain.It keeps very cool inside thanks to a well done air flow design, but the stock fans are loud, very loud, and can be distracting, replace them for ones you can actually control."
2,It was a very good book. It explains in full detail the history of Goju-ryu karate. It also has step by step instructions for katas with black and white pictures. Almost every page has a picture. This book also has a glossary with the Japanese terms translated from Japanese to English and English to Japanese with the phoenetic pronunciation. Motoo Yamakura is a very good martial arts writer.
2,"Mr. Franklin was one of a kind. His take on life is so unique that it forces us to understand why we do not have anyone like him today. Brilliant, creative, passionate, and critical, he writes about himself with almost a 3rd person view. It is a much delightful read and one good enough to make a gift out of it. The cost of it on Kindle is hard to resist and Franklin would like that too. Of course, had he been living now with his genius, it would have been called the ""Franklin"" not Kindle."
1,"I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
2,Simply one of the better bands around today. Do yourself a favor and pick any of their music. I'm sure you'll find it a pleasant surprise.
1,"So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"
2,I think this movie was really really good! i love it so much! i recommended this movie to all my friends and family and they all loved it!!! in the beginning you wonder what the hell is going on? but if you pay attention you will understand the whole movie! i thought it was the best yakuza movie i had seen so far...
2,"We have one of these, and while we're not always able to work it into our layout on the train table, it's definitely been in some of our favorite configurations. Plus, it provides for that all important ""train crash"" action when two engines are trying to cross at the same time!"
1,"This movie seems like an exploitation on an idea of what Kurt Cobain's last days may have been like. In the end, it is boring, long, slow, and completely ridiculous."
2,"Brook Benton has one of those smooth singing styles along with Sam Cook, Nat King Cole and John Gary that just wraps itself around a song and makes you want to hear it over and over again. This particular collection is home to some of my favorite songs from my pre-teens. My dad was a Brook Benton fan and through him I learned to appreciate a song sung the way it was meant to be. The string arrangements that accompany Benton's awesome voice are nothing short of perfect. You rock-n-roll fans (that includes me) may scoff at this music style, but given a fair chance Brook Benton will win you over...I guarantee it!"
2,"wow, this CD is amazing.So good i scrached it after 1 year and bought it again.Put your earphones, play this disc and take a walk.Its so good that walls are almost changing colors.this jazzanova song is incredible.I dont like evrything from kid loco.Only this cd and Grand love story."
1,I've never wrote a review about any product. I'm usually satisfied. This however kind of ticked me off. The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them. they were also not the right size. I ended up giving them away.
2,"I've always enjoyed www.20Q.net, so when I saw this toy and the positive ratings, I thought I would give it a try. As you might expect, it is not as advanced as the 20Q web site, but it is much smarter than I had expected. I'd say it gets the right answer about 2/3 of the time with ""normal"" people and kids. You do need to be able to read to use it alone, but the questions are fairly simple - my 6 year has no problems playing it by himself. It also has some funny (and clean) answers for people with ""dirty"" minds.After buying one, I went back and bought 6 more as gifts for kids. BTW, GameStop[.com] has them for cheaper."
1,"The movie infatuated sub-literate ""reviews"" of this adaptation immediately turned me off, they can probably only ingest it in audio format. The Amazon no-name who misspelled HARLAN ELLISON's name didnt help, he's a vastly better writer than roth, and the only reason I was going to buy these tapes, guess not."
1,I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise. Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing. Disappointing...
2,"Dr. Barnard's ""Tackling Diabetes"" is only for those willing to listen carefully and summon up th discipline to follow his not-too-complicated Rx. It helps! I may later be able to say the type II I struggle with is gone. For the moment, I can say without hesitation, my blood sugar is considerably lower in the morning, which has been a constant problem for me. His clear, uncomplicated recommendations require commitment to a pattern of eating that can drastically reduce the presence of high glucose in one's blood, help reduce weight, and help bring about a certain amount of personal peace.My opinion is that all plans to 'self treat' diabetes should be shared with one's doctor."
1,"This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
2,"I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."
2,"Like every treatment of the Arab Israeli conflict, this book will not please everyone (or anyone?). The book is brisk. Fortunately, Morris has an even tone throughout and does not remain fixed on any one subject for too long. As anyone knows who has written on a broad topic, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict. And this book shows that despite some of Morris' more inflammatory interviews recently, he can still present a work of historical research that is even handed and fair."
2,This is a basic book on how your thoughts are vibrations. They vibrate out into the Universe and you get exactly what you vibrate. This is a good book to carry around in a purse or pocket to remind yourself of this simple Law of Attraction.
2,The High Life Cannabis Cup 2005 is the highlight of my year. Over the past few years I always come back broke. This year I wanted to take home more. After careful selection I bought a Buddy that uses magnets to clean bongs. It cost ten dollars. I also bought this book because it looked good. I also bought a book called Hashish. I recommend this book for growing information and Hashish for the history. I enjoyed reading this book at the cup and I am very sure you will also.
2,"It used to be typical for the majority of Evangelical Christians to insist that the true Jesus (2 Cor. 11:4) was the only way to God, as all other ways fell short. John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."
2,"Please ignore the immature high-school student reviews and understand that this book is a masterpiece. Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental! This is one of the best books I have read and believe me, I have read a lot of the ""good"" books."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth."
1,"I had to read this book for school (literery circles, and I made the mistake of picking this think) I'm in 8th grade, and I thought this book was rather stupid. The basic plot was fine, but the thing was like a soap opera, where everyone was with the wrong person, and of course, everyone was ever so happy at the end. I would have found this a more enjoyable book if the ending had been Kit marrying Willam, Judith becoming an old maid, and Nat marrying someone else. (Still John with Mercy though, because they deserve it.)The reason I gave this two stars is that readers 8-10 would probably enjoy this, but if you're a teenager or even an older preteen, I wouldn't recomend it."
2,Shows how the story of one man can make a difference. Such a good read about the life of a slave. Something alien to a lot of people. The book draws you in from the start you wont want to put it down.
2,"I read the book and loved it. When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms. Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store. But I was wrong. This book is really two books. The work book is designed to be cut into two different books. One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign. The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook. And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort. The rewards are great. This is a dynimite combination. He is really something else. I recommend this book very highly."
2,"""Macross Plus"" is my favourite movie, and the OST fits it perfectly. After purchasing it I quickly located and purchased the OST's for ""The Vision of Escaflowne"" and the other ""Macross Plus"" albums based purely on the fact that they were by Yoko Kanno. Most of it's performed by members of the Israel Symphonic Orchestra, and it's a mixture of classical style and techno music. Ohh, it's just great. Unfortunately, I'm not much on elaboration..."
1,"Is this what the music industry has turned into? As if the zombied brain dead haven't ruined it enough for those of us that know how to turn off the television. Music is about capturing the intangable, not fashion makeovers for the poor little geek. Explore artists with creativity and not this junk that is being spoonfed to the masses. You know you'll just end up using this CD as a coaster in 2 months anyway."
2,Everyone read this book !!!! Then read everything else that Sylvia has wrote. There is always a blessing to be recieved.
2,"This is a great little book on purity. I read it in an hour and couldn't put it down. ""The Purity Principle"" gets ""in your face"" on the issue of sexual purity, speaking directly, but not inappropriately about the slippery slope that is sexual sin and practical ways to combat it. The engaging message was so vivid and powerful that I immediately ordered two additional copies so that each of my sons could have their own.My one reservation about this book is that it does not give enough help and hope to the person who has already seriously fallen and needs help getting on the right track. I am concerned that such a person, rather than seeing the power of a gracious God to restore them, might feel that they are too far gone for a meaningful recovery after reading this book."
2,"These are wonderful for running. I have Nike also, but these are the best, bar none. I now have three of these, and they keep me running!"
1,"While I think it's a good quality ball, the pump is terrible. Mine broke before it was fully inflated. The thing is about as cheap as they can possibly make it.Very disappointing that they can't provide a higher quality product."
1,"This book has a novel premise and that's about it. This might have made a good short story, but as a novel it is completely uninspiring. The characters are all cardboard cutouts who inspire no empathy. The plot consists of one unbelievable deus ex machina turn after another. The contrived mini-chapters with the giveaway titles are annoying. The natives of the planet Melaquin have no depth or ingenuity behind them. Don't bother with this book."
1,"I used this product for about a week and a half then decided to stop using it. At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much. Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too. When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on, it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot. If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that isn't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep. It's a little pricy for what it actually is."
1,"I bought this set thinking I was going to enjoy many hours of The Stooges. It only has a few shorts that are all over-played on TV, having seen them a hundred times already.Charging a full retail price for a set like this, containing just a few shorts, is shameful. You're paying an extra 10 bucks for the tin box, little more. This set is a bargain-bin type item worth maybe four to five bucks at most.It's my fault for being suckered out of my money. This purchase has taught me to read the content descriptions VERY CAREFULLY before buying future ""special collections.""Now I'm off to buy the REAL complete chronological collections of The Three Stooges being released by Sony Pictures."
2,Havent been able to find this album in years. Great buy! If you haven't heard it and like odd ball music with a flare of ronchyness this is it
2,"This forum is for your opinion of the book, not for each of you to explain the plot over and over again. That's already done above."
1,"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
1,"Hot Space is not only Queen's worst album (I'm leaving out their contribution to Flash Gordon) but may be one of the worst of all time. From the first notes of Staying Power, one wants to ring up Brian May and ask him, ""Dear god WHAT were you thinking? Did someone put a gun to your head and make you record this awful formulated music?"" Queen is one of my all-time favorite rock bands, but to hear them playing dance music like performing monkeys is torture to me. The first five songs are truly awful (horns on a Queen song??). This is the new funky Queen. Freddie Mercury is ""Calling All Girls""? Please! The second half has some nice rock and roll tunes, as if they woke up from their haze. ""Under Pressure"" with David Bowie is one of a kind. ""Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)"" is surprisingly touching. But even these don't make up for an attempt by Queen to apparently ride the success of ""Another One Bites the Dust"" by turning up the funk levels to 11. Be afaid, be very afraid."
2,"This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
1,"This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air. I am very upset that in returning, I will not get full refund for this defective product! There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!"
2,"Didn't see the BD review on Blu-ray.com so thought I write a quick one. Just watched the BD version this week and actually very happy and impressed by the transfer and DTS audio. Would give the video a 4.5 stars out of 5, and audio 5 out of 5. The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.Perhaps just a slight downside and that is the BD clarity and details do make Diane Lane look a tad older than she needs to be.But, still a great release and worthy purchase."
1,I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
2,"I wasn't familiar with this drama when I checked it out from the library but soon spent the majority of my Sunday watching this. Featuring a wonderful cast and well-written script, this political-media thriller won't disappoint. I would have given it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so frustrating, but then I suppose how else could have it ended? Definitely not predictable and will keep you guessing till the end. Please note there are 6 episodes, with 750 minutes (12.5 hours) total so be prepared to watch as you can give it your full attention or you will be at a loss when trying to keep track."
1,"Never ordered it, it was sent by mistake and I returned it upon receipt without even opening it so I don't know."
1,"Sadly, the kindle edition is replete with typos - seemingly from an un-proofread OCR translation. A truly great book, but completely unreadable. Too bad Roth's publisher isn't available on the itunes store..."
2,"After waiting for months to get this album I was a little disappointed with the opening track ""Invisible"". It didn't sound like the Clay we have all come to know and love. The first few tracks sounded a bit ""over-produced"" and lacked the style that makes Clay special, but as the album progresses, so do the quality of the recordings. After a few listens to the album, I've found that every song has something special to offer whether it be Clay's vocals or the lyrics or the music itself. One thing I enjoy most about the album is that it has more of a ""rock"" type feel to it on many of the tracks and doesn't fall strictly into the ""pop"" genre as most people come to know it (eg. Justin Timberlake, Justin Guarini, etc)."
2,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new ""cartoony"" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.This ""special edition"" DVD is very dissapointing in the way of extras though, with no features of any kind, not even a trailer! This could be forgiven if the sound and picture quality wasn't so shoddy! Thankfully, a re-release issue will be out later this year...."
1,"Clay, Clay, Clay. Knock it off. Seriously, you are getting on America's nerves. You didn't win American Idol, and you don't deserve to release this album. What's really annoying is that there are only positive reviews of this album on Amazon.com. Hopefully Amazon.com won't censor the freedom of speech, and the freedom to let you know before you do a stupid thing, that this album is a disgrace to Music as we knew it. The only reason one should buy this album is to discourage someone else from buying by publicly setting it on fire or by letting your friends listen to it... a word of caution: listen near the toilet so you don't have far to go when you have to throw up."
1,Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
2,"Ghost's fourth solo project, but the first he would be releasing on Def Jam. Ghost returns to prove all the doubters wrong and come out with the intense, raw and emotional styles of rap that we all came to recognise over a decade ago. Ghost's rapping hasn't changed much during his absense in the rap, I feel Ghost only improves with age, with cuts like ""Biscuits"" and ""Metal Lungies"", Ghost seems more hungry than ever to go head-to-head with the best of 'em. With cuts like ""Save Me Dear"", Ghost shows his love for women. Also Ghost comes back to takeover the club jams with ""Tush"" featured with ""Missy Elliot"". Also RZA shows up for ""Run"" with Jadakiss. The album shows Ghost leading the Wu-Tang to the right direction and sooner or later they will be back to smash the world!"
1,"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money."
1,I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.
2,Makes excellent rice. Easy to use and usefull features. It slides on counter when buttons are pushed. Feet should be more rubbery to stick better. Need two hands to operate with one hand holding onto the unit. Still a fine product that does what it's intended to do.Highly recommended. I found mine for $135.
2,"I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie."
1,"Sorry tigerbutter boy. If I want to listen to Flop songs, I'm going to put ""Fall of the Mopsqueezer"" into my CD player."
2,"My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
1,I had to read this book for my school's reading list. It was by far the worst book that I have ever read. There was no plot at all. All of my friends also thought that it was bad. Even some of my friend's parents thought so too!! My final word is DONT READ IT!!
1,"This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
2,"If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
1,"I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."
1,I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill
1,"I read this book several years ago, but didn't write a review. I decided to renew my interest in the Foundation series and since this book was hazy in my memory, I decided to reread it. Now I remember why it's hazy. This has to be the most boring and wordy book Asimov has ever written, period. I found myself skipping over large sections of nonsense dialogue of Bliss arguing with Trevise about Gaia. Nobody talks and discusses as much without saying anything as the characters in this book! I managed to get on by skimming and concentrating on plot points. Asimov in his foreword said his publisher asked him to write a large book and he complied by filing it with 80% useless chatter and boring dialogue. He could have written a good short story about this quest for Earth that would have been enjoyable, rather that this bloated, boring, and frankly turgid effort. I gave it two stars in respect to Asimov, had it been any other author, one or no stars."
1,"Guess I should've known better than to buy a ""special edition"" This has scenes edited out. I'm very disappointed, what a prude sissyfied country America is these days. ZERO stars for this version. Original version gets FIVE!"
1,"I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay. I thought the experimental ""and then"" parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the otherGroundhog Dayin how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though."
2,Couldn't put any of the books in this series down. There is a college education in those books!
2,"Props to Will Connelly. I found it real researchable, very good to find, and overall the book I must find. I love it. It gives tips on rehearsing, what studio to built or to use, what type'a of equipment you must use or have, I mean it gives everything out from chapter to chapter.It also includes bibliography and recommendations you must read and know about. Good information."
2,"I have never seen a book quite like this, although I have come across self-help books or instructional guides which try to help with some simple guidelines. This book on the other hand gives complete and numerous examples and practical methods to achieve the goals given (Note: the section on working with the AIDS Patients.) As if all the other books were afraid to open up..........or perhaps they just didn't have much to say. This wonderful guide lets it rain down.....and when it rains, it pours."
1,"i have a friend who loaned me a copy of this book and insisted i read it and spread the word... thank god i didn't spend money on it. the stories seem forced, almost like they were taken from real life experience and then re-told in such a way as to make them thoroughly unbelievable. i hope that the essays aren't all autobiographical, because they seem to come from a core of desperation that is just painful to read. this guy has potential but really needs to find his own voice and stop trying so hard... i might give his sophomore effort a try (if there is one) but i wouldn't waste the moolah on this one"
2,"Ben Fong Torres life , as a young editor for Rolling Stone Magazine and his life of interviews for. 20 + yearsIs an easy read and a must read if you're truly a rock and roll fan..."
2,"This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!"
2,"I bought this item after the folks at Radio Shack told me there was no way to use a TiVo without a phone line. Once I got it setup with my wireless network, it's been great. Doesn't need internet access very often, but it is definitely much faster than with a phone line (setup took about half the time, if not less). I've had it now for over a month and have had no problems. We'll see how well it lasts."
1,I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite. In fact I was rather unhappy with the whole book. Now don't get me wrong he is a great writer but this book bored me. I don't read to get bored.
2,This is the book that got me buying the other two in the series. I got it through the lending library on my kindle fire. I love the books that just appeal to me. Its much better than watching a movie.
2,"Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!"
2,"It might just be! That means a hell of alot too. It's a shame that that this band is labled 'nu-metal', becuase honestly, this is the most punk rock thing I've heard in a while. Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up"
1,"This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?"
1,"This book took almost two weeks to receive. Not to mention when I did finally get my copy in the mail, I was disappointed to see that the play skipped from Act II to Act V. Very disappointing."
1,I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.
1,"The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
2,"Of course, I grew up listening to this Ramsey Lewis collection through my open bedroom door as my parents decorated the house to make way for the magic of Christmas that was to come~so these Sounds of Christmas are intimately woven into those fondest memories of childhood. But don't take my word for it! Have a listen, and experience how in each piece Lewis wasn't just recreating old stand-bys, he was striving to make them an expression of his own experience of Christmas, and that's the thrill. I can listen to this over and over, long after the season has past, and still get excited."
2,What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book. Anyone who is into speleology should buy this book and relish the fun and science occuring through-out it.
1,"Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
1,"This book is another example of ""hands-off"" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources. In summary, in deciding whether to purchase this book---pass!"
2,The best rice we've ever made. All claims provided by Cooks Illustrated are true. Excellant product that is so easy to use!
2,"Typical Steven Berry book - action thriller with a historical/fact base. A quick read that keeps the pages turning. I enjoy these books immensely - but this particular book is a little far fetched for me with heavenly appartitions and such.Having siad that, it is great entertainment, and provides enough interesting historical tidbits that it remains classic Berry and a good read."
2,"While this film may not win an academy award the aerial fighting sequences make it well worth the money ---plus the acting from relatively unknown actors was not bad at all----Those people who tout all the films historical errors tis IS a fictionalized account of Lafayette Escadrille how many of the critics especially some of the women critics have even heard of this name before? --Name one WW1 aviation film that has gotten it all correct you can't --""The Blue Max one of my favorites had pilots pulling on some sort of handle to fire their machine guns (all wrong) and had lozenge camouflage on the Fokker Triplanes which was also wrong --there is plenty wrong but I still loved the Blue Max as I love this film too---Maybe director Peter Jackson (King KONG) (who is rumoured considering) remaking the BLUE MAX WILL GET ALL THE SMALL DETAILS RIGHT AND ALSO make a kickass film that even the critics will have to love! Go see FLYBOYS You will be entertained!"
2,"The best complimentI could pay this book is that I want to read the sequel. The book inexplicably overstates ours welcome in some areas only to rush through others. I almost wish this first volume had been split into two more comprehensive books. Overall, an entertaining and rewarding read."
2,"If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called ""The Bad News Bears on skates,"" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)"
2,"Very good air mattress, have had many friends come and stay on it and it hasn't lost much air. Would recommend it if you need an air mattress for visitors."
1,"I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe? I received this book as a gift, from a well-meaning friend. I would have much rather gotten one of rachel Ray's books, as she really knows how to make fast and simple meals from fresh ingredients."
2,"Hitchcock in this film examines what it is like to actually go through with the job of killing someone, as you are authorized and ordered to do. John Gielgud, from the Shakespearean stage, makes a worthy effort as does Madelline Carrol, who was in The 39 Steps as well. Peter Lorre, while a tad over-the-top and at some times irritating, is a joy to watch. The main villain is very smooth and a treat to watch as well. Comedic elements thrown in with tension and suspense makes Secret Agent a worthwhile Hitchcock film. From The Man Who Knew Too Much to The Lady Vanishes, Hitchcock could do no wrong. Secret Agent proves it."
1,"Sentimental, shallow book about WWII vets. I agree with his assessment of the generation, however. Read Stephen Ambrose if you want good WWII books. This book is only selling because the author is a celebrity. Duh."
1,"I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better)."
2,"Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Anyhow, the battery came in original and undamaged Canon packaging (looks just like the images available in product description). I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time. Our camera is fairly new so it was a fair comparison - one battery wasn't all that much older than the other.Email me with questions: mister_mr_d@hotmail.com"
2,"I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book. Keep it close to you. It will happen...""England will be the World Cup Champion again."
1,If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. Over singing and generic guitars make for a bland album. Just my opinion.
2,"Bonds sole of shoes well, but it was difficult not to get the glue on other parts not intended to be glued."
2,"I cannot find where to buy my size and which ear I use my eargel. What in the world are you supposed to do with 3 sizes and 3 sides when you most likely will only use 1 size and 1 side??The product is comfortable and without the use of a boom mike makes this product number 1, except for being able to buy the right size eargel replacements."
2,"I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."
1,"If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all."
1,I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one!
2,"It's about time the world heard a woman's account of the 1996 Everest tragedy. Ms. Gammelgaard delivers the most poignant and moving account to date. Unlike her male counterparts, she is not afraid to delve deeply into her psyche and emotions and shares with the reader her inspiring perspective of Everest and of the greater world we live in."
2,My mom works at the middle school I go to and every moning I would go on the computer and go to neopets. One day it got blocked and I dont have time after school because of homework dance soccer and running and my computer takes a REALLY LONG time to connect I have 8 neopet plushies a notebook and a picture fram so you can see Im a BIG fan of neopetsThis is the best toy! Its just like neopets on line just chats not there and e-mails are also not.Igot the Kackeek because that my fav.
1,"I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
1,"Now, then:Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me count the ways:1) It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters. Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal ""strong man"" ""seedy guy"" ""angry little guy"" ""seductive wife"" its disgusting. he even has a token black guy! Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important ""moral"" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say ""ew!"" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and ""realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general."" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived! The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book. its all crap.There. Just in case you missed it...[...]"
2,great action movie with great cast.. only wish it was more comic book like.. like in tim burton's movies
1,"I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it. I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble. Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.What are the publishers thinking? Does their greed know no bounds? They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost. Amazon had it right when they launched the Kindle $9.99 for hot sellers, yeah I can get behind that but I can't get behind what the publishers strong armed Amazon into."
1,"I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying."
1,"If there is one good thing about this book, its that I borrowed it from a friend who had been unfortunate enough to be duped into buying it. This woman shows less skill than would be expected from the children she claims to be writing for. The writing is clumsy and inept, the concept boring. Save your time and money and find something written by an author with talent."
2,"The movie is great, but the service (and prices) amazon provides for this film is great. I'm very happy to have bought the rights to this digital product rather than buying a dvd from some brick and mortar retailer! Great movie, great convenience!"
1,"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
1,I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.
1,"Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed. Installed the card in a snap without incident. Tried connecting my Ipod and it immediately started charging so I thought I was good. However, I opened itunes and nothing. Went to the iogear website thinking i needed to update the driver when I stumbled across the statement on the Tech Support Library, document #10162:""Why won't my IPod work with the GUF320?Both the IPod and mini-IPod require a Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) certified card to connect to the computer. At this time, the GUF320 is not WHQL certified.We apologize for any inconvenience.""Well that would have been nice to know before I ordered the card and wasted my time and effort."
1,It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
2,"When I read Mr. Gill's book, for the first time ever, I realized it was possible to own my home before I'm old and grey! The book also opened my eyes to the advantages (think peace of mind) of having a strong equity base rather than being leveraged to the hilt and constantly panicked about my debt load. The book is clear, inspiring and a quick read. Above all it is informative. I feel I can now tackle my home loan and pay it off on my terms rather than the bank's. Boy does that feel empowering! I'm telling all my friends about this!"
2,"I've actually seen the authors live and read their other works, including ""The New Intimacy"" (another great book for couples). Their writing is creative, spot-on, funny, and amazingly insightful. Engaged couples are blessed to have this practical and soulfull guide as a trusty ally in starting off right. Worth every penny. Get it to the next stressed-out groom and bride you know."
2,i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks
1,"I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book."
2,"I wish that I can have a pocket neopet.I have seen alot of kids with those toys.I have been told that you can buy those in ""TOYRUS"".I can so wish having one of those things.My mom was going to buy me one in Toysrus but she ended up having a lost wallet and a lost makeup bag so I thought that since my mom has no money for it I would enter this and I will get a free pocket neopet.Every day I get so excited to get one but I never did.I always go on the website of the neopets and see if I could win one some day.But I dont know how to get to win a free pocket neopet online but I never did .I mom tells me to keep on trying and I do when ever I have my free time I go online and try."
2,I have not had an issue with the baby dry diapers. i have been using them for my baby since she was born and I don't think I would switch to an another brand. I have tried seventh generation and huggies but pampers works best for me.
1,"This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful."
1,"Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
2,It's awesome to buy diapers online instead of having to go out and get them at the store. I use the super saver deal so I don't pay shipping. Pampers have always been my favorite brand.
1,"I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another."
1,"Silly, syrupy lyrics throughout and, surprisingly, the vocals are completely uninspired. This can't be what Aiken wanted."
2,They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big. I haven't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him.
2,I bought a box of pampers dry when it was on sale at Amazon.com + 15% desc subscribe and save. It was really worth! Very convenient to shop on the confort of our home and have it delivered to our door in no time!
1,"This DVD is awful. I have never written a review, but after 5 minutes of this DVD I couldn't believe I wasted my money. Maybe a beginner might enjoy this, but certainly not someone who has exercised a day in their life. There is no need for all the breaks except to waste your time."
2,"This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair."
2,"The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to."
1,"The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. It's not much fun and the picture isn't as good as some. Not an enjoyable experience at all - and we love puzzles!"
2,"I truly enjoyed this movie, but would have liked it to be a little more detailed. It seemed to jump from one scene to another too quickly. The acting was done very well and Sergio Castellitto, protrayed Padre Pio very much like himself. I have already watched it in its entirety about four times. And I still get emotional each time."
2,"First of all, I would not have bought this CD if it were recorded by any one other than Clay Aiken.I like the guy; I think he's the ""real deal"".I actually like the song Invisible more than I thought I would.It is very catchy and I find myself singing it long after I've turned it off.I don't find most of the other songs to be outstanding or even greatly original. I do however enjoy Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs. Clearly Clay had a hand in choosing some of these tunes as the lyrics reflect on Clay's own professed religious and spiritual beliefs. Most of the songs allow Clay to showcase his beautiful vocals.BR>I would love to hear him do Solitaire and to hear Bridge over Troubled Water again. I wish that those two cuts were on this CD.I am looking forward to hearing more from Clay; original music and covers that really show what he's got.I wish Clay all the success in the world and am happy to do my part to support his future in music."
1,"This movie was terrible. No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either."
1,"Okay, so I read the bio on the series and thought I would like this anime. Boy, was I wrong. there are several cute episodes, but the story line is totally empty. Almost every episode is really sad, and in the end, the main character never reaches her goal. Everybody dies, and it is just aweful."
1,"I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises."
2,He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
1,"This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a ""play all"" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I've been able to pop a disk out of."
2,Writen hundreds of years ago it's just as true today as when Voltaire wrote it. It pokes fun of all members of society from philopsophers and priests to politicians.Definetely some of the greatest satire written. Right up there with Johnathan Swift.
1,"THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
2,"This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in."
1,"I spent almost $400 including extra motion sensors. Was very excited to get it, but as soon as I put a battery in one of the sensors (never even plugged the base in), my house alarm went to trouble. I tried for over a year to get it resolved, but was continually told to try something else (move this, turn on before you reach the house, etc...) I called my house alarm guy and he said the frequency should not be the same, but they conflict for sure. I can't say if this works at all, since I don't have another house to try it out on. Super disappointed. I will say, that when I called, I always got a very nice man who seemed like he was trying to help but never offered a refund or a solution that would work. I bought a cheap unit that didn't work well, then spent a good amount on this and it still didn't work well."
2,"This is the second book I've read by Sylvia Browne. I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc. I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.I have recently read ""What Dreams May Come"" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story. (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).There were still a few times while reading ""Book of Dreams"" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, ""Wow, is she for real??"" But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense. Since her theories are hard to prove, our faith and beliefs are what spirituality is all about. I enjoy Browne and her books, and I rate this read a 4 out of 5 stars."
2,"I purchased the streaming version of this TV Movie. Historally, it's pretty accurate as TV Movies go. The problem is that the streaming from Amazon Instant Video is pretty choppy. There's a studder about every two minutes or so that makes it pretty distracting. Amazon needs to work on the video of this movie. But for $3.95, what can one expect."
2,"and I wish that no back-up singers were used, as his voice stands alone, and doesn't need any ""enhancing/help.""I hope on his next album Clay will sing more acapella songs, that have a wide range to show off his voice, without any back-up singers and loud music. I want to hear the real/raw voice of ""Clay.""You're still number one with me!Clay, I wish you all the best, please don't let Hollywood ""corrupt"" you. Stay your humble self.Blessings to you!!"
2,"This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."
1,"Ordered this product expecting to receive what was shown on the picture but got something different. The picture showed 8.5"" cable cutters, I received 8"" cable cutters with alot less cutting ability. Very disappointing!"
2,"Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness."
1,Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.
2,This little thing for 9.99 is just mind-blowing and amazing. I thought today if I don't review this it is not fair. This little thing has so much of power. I use it EVERYDAY. For the past year or so. I have forgotten and slept over night leaving it switched on for like Eight Hours of time that is not including the usage of during the day time. The best value product I have ever bought for 9.99. I used it everyday and still using it. If I can give it a Ten Stars I will give it. Don't think just buy it. Just a tip have cover on top of your Coffee or Tea where it will stay hot as you just made it. Two thumbs up and Ten Stars.
2,I was replacing my old cook book & I thought this was the same one but it isn't but it is a nice cook book.
2,"Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him. He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him. It's well built. Arrived in only a couple days. Our son loves it!!"
2,"Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
1,"I've been wearing Chucks for years now, but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months. The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe, and I've only used these shoes for casual walking. Pretty ridiculous."
2,"I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
2,"When I heard ""Faith Children"" I nearly cried. It has such a haunting complexity to it. Like it's hinting at how simple things can be so frightening. I don't know, but it is lovely."
1,Did not really get lost in there book....found it boring....and I really wanted to stop reading it! But chose to painstakingly finish it..
2,"I do like the atmosphere on this CD. It brings back memories of the folk mmusic from when I was young (sixties, early seventies. I also like lyrics and his views on society."
2,"For someone who listens to very little R&B or hip-hop, I have always admired and liked R. Kelly for his great talent. The man has soul, and this new CD is a great addition to what is becoming an impressive body of work. 'Just Like That' and ""I Wish' are two of the best tracks here, and maybe better than anything D'Angelo or Maxwell have done. What is surprising is that he doesn't get more media attention: how many millions of albums has he sold while white bread lightweights like NSYNC and Christina Ag get all the attention. 'TP-2.COM' has a dumb title, but this is smart, sexy, soulful music."
2,"This is my second endeavor into the famed distopia trilogy. Unfortunately, I should have read this one first. I loved Brave New World, but I think this is in a class by itself. I read somewhere that Brave New World was written without knowledge of this book, which would make the similarities uncanny. Anyway, This story grabbed me from the very beginning with the effective use of numbers to substitute characters names. This let's you know right off the bat that this future society is not joking around. The intertwining fashion used between dreams and reality was especially appealing, giving this novel a surrealistic feel. The thing that hooks this novel into masterpiece status is the ending. Unlike Brave New World, this was one I was not expecting. Also, the fact that a man living in communist Russia wrote this novel really enhances the experience and shows you the nightmarish visions this man derived from his way of life. Platinum."
1,"They write good music. They play their instruments well. The can write crafty hooks. So blame it on the singer and the lyricist (my guess, same person). The vocals are as weak as it's content, which ranges from anywhere to wimpy subjects as being afraid to ride rollercoasters to things so dull and ordinary it makes you roll your eyes when you hear them. The closest comparisons to this band is Orange Peels. Never heard of them either? Then imagine what Air Supply would sound like if they made an alternative album. The Lucksmiths could be a great a band if they didn't sing about such stupid things. ..."
1,"The ability to adjust the weight of this product is great. The BIG disappointment is the velcro strap, which I can't believe will last long, especially as I begin to add more weights. I think this product would have been far better if the ankle weight came with an adjustable strap with a plastic buckle closure. Then you would adjust once and just simply buckle the strap when you put it on. This feature is especially critical when you're trying to put the weight on your ""bad"" leg and struggling to get it snug with the long unwieldy velcro strap. I can not recommend this device with this strap mechanism."
2,This item is great. I had no problem getting it set up and running. The price was lower than at other websites.
2,"This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible, sexy, and captivating. So subtle in its beauty, it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart. I am not fluent in Spanish, but the music totally gets inside your skin. Beautiful arrangements, beautiful melodies, beautiful voice. It can only make your life better."
1,"Do not buy this book. It is a waste of your money. If you buy this book ,it will sit somewhere and never go to use ,even if you just read the first 2 pages you will be disgusted."
1,"I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
1,"I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!"
1,Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic... flimsy and not durable. Can not get the elevator to work properly always jams up. This toy won't last to long.
2,"My only disappointment in this movie has to do with the variations from the book. Otherwise, it kept Narnia alive from the hard-to-beat 1st movie in the series."
1,"I purchased this book thinking it was going to be a book specifically talking about Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, it wasn't.I would venture to guess that if you took the few pages about Chesapeakes OUT of the book, ALL of the books written by this author geared toward a specific breed would all read the same!Not a book to buy if you are looking for information on Chessies."
2,"This movie is definately NOT for children. Its beginning is somewhat disgusting, but the rest of the movie is great. Its storyline is really cool, and if you're a hard-core anime fan, this movie is for you."
1,"Beware...I bought 6 of these with the ridges on the lower part of the mug...since I cannot find replacement mugs for my original (1999) boscoware mugs with ridges on the sides....I was SOO disappointed...these tip over precariously, really bad design..I got rid of all of them, and keep hoping BoscoWare will product the original design...wider at the bottom, more stable, with ridges up the sides..in great colors...I wish I had bought 100 of them!But DON'T get these...you will regret it!"
1,A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked.
2,"We are strictly a Pampers family. We used swaddlers until my son grew out of size 2-3s then we went directly to cruisers. We had a few leakage issues with cruisers, when my son would roll to his belly in the middle of the night, but were happy with them in general. A few friends of ours had been using baby dry's and metioned that they loved them (and that they were a little cheaper than cruisers!) so we decided to give them a try. And we LOVE them. We have not had one overnight leak! The only complaint that I have is that the tabs are made a little cheaper than swaddlers & cruisers, and a few of them have ripped right off as I'm fastening the diaper. I've just learned to be a little gentler with them, and we haven't had a problem since. Overall, I give them an A!"
2,I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product
2,"The version of this CD that includes ""Vitaminless"" is a bootleg. It'll be from ""Sonmay"" or ""Everanime"" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks."
1,Was surprised at how boring this book was. A lot of blah blah about things I cared nothing about. A relative of mine was Norma Baden Wallace who was known as the Last Madam and Queen of the Underworld. She wasn't mentioned.
1,"An interesting story, but the author tried to do too much in 400 pages. Too many characters and too many voices resulted in a somewhat awkward tale full of flat, one-note caricatures. At first, I found it somewhat misogynistic, as the first hundred pages lacked a single female character that wasn't a monster, a nutjob, or a complete waste of oxygen; as I read on, I realized that the male characters weren't any better, there were just more of them. Being un-Christian, and especially un-Catholic, I just didn't ""get"" a lot of the horror aspects of this book, either. Ho-hum, the Succubus is killing someone else now, next? This is the author's first novel, though, so maybe the next attempt will be better. Not a horrible book, but not compelling enough to take with me to finish on a plane."
1,"This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
1,lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
2,It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. Very helpful and easy to use.
1,"I purchased this card with the adapter. The card worked fine in my cell phone, but when I used plugged it into the adapter, my computer wouldn't read it. I know it wasn't my computer because other cards work fine. I contacted the company and one rep gave me the run around (via email). So I called them and the man was kind enough to send me a new adapter free of charge. That one didn't work either!! Waste of money!"
2,"Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help."
1,"How did this collection of letters make it to print...when there are scores of personalities whose letters I'd love to read in a collection that haven't? These letters are very boring and he did not write to many notable people (a few to McCartney, Lennon and Olivier). Before you read about a theater critic, read what William Goldman said in his legendary book about Broadway THE SEASON, in the chapter titled ""The Approvers."" That tells you all about theater critics you need to know. THEN you can decide whether to read this one of Tynan's letters. I don't think this book would have made it to print if Tynan's wife hadn't been shoving it down publisher's and editor's throats. Dull, dull, dull, except for about five of the letters."
1,"This US release was supposed to be like the UK release and include a hybrid SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) as well as the DVD. It does not. The SACD has been replaced by a regular CD. Extremely disappointing ! I'll be purchasing the UK release instead...According to Mute's Head of Catalogue, David Rowntree, Mute commissioned Simon Heyworth's Super Audio Mastering facility to perform the critical re-mastering work for this album. Quote: ""The SA-CD versions take the sound to another level - the next best thing to being there!"". ""If you don't have an SA-CD player, DTS 96/24 is the next best thing.""He doesn't even mention the 44.1 kHz PCM audio of the CD version, which evidently, most of you are listening to.(A digital audio technology which is now 24 years old, by the way. Hey, maybe they will issue the US release on 8-track cartridge too)."
1,"I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary. I have understood two chapters! I don't see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences! It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering. As I stated before, this is not my kind of book!"
1,"This is a terrible DVD. The sound and picture quality are both terrible. The first couple of songs we watched all of showed more or Rod's butt in those gold shiny pants than it did his face. Prancing around and shaking his butt with the two big red veil type scarfs he wore it looked really weird. My wife was laughing her own rearend off it was so funny. I should return it but I will sacrife the money and warn others do not buy this DVD as it is absolutely terrible. We have purchased Rod Stewart ""One Night Only Live at Royal Albert Hall"" and ""It had to be You"" and both of these DVD's I would rate 5 stars for sound and picture. We actually enjoy these two DVD's so much we exercise to them. They are so enjoyable we have 30 minutes of exercise done before we realize it. The actually gives us a bit of incentive to exercise."
1,"While the information in this book might be a good starting point for someone totally new to thyroid disorders, I found it too basic, and too entrenched in mainstream theory and treatments to be helpful. Too much repeating of information easily found on just about any thyroid drug manufacturer's website, or just from surfing around the web. It is not a book I kept for my personal library --which for me (books are life!) is unusual."
1,"Do not purchase this piece of whistler garbage its cheap for a reason I used it for 1 year long distance and regular city driving, I can visual see the cops before it goes off lots of false alert but very few true alerts your better off steering clear of whistler products period."
2,"The music was slightly different than I expected- more Modern, I guess. I like it though and will listen to it."
1,"I've had the smaller model only about a month. Nevertheless, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Not recommended.Better brands include Firth, Unicorn's Magnum and Magnum Plus, William Bounds, and Peugeot."
1,"I keep hoping that Ball will release an album that isn't as overproduced as his vibrato but I have yet to hear it. How can an album this uncreative seem so pretentious? I wish Ball would follow in the footsteps of Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone and others who have toned down their vocals and orchesrations and give us a more intimate and diverse look at what he can do. Please save the theatrics for the Original Cast Albums!Just my opinion.JMF"
2,"I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album."
1,"This is yet another mediocre release in a litany of mediocre to sub-mediocre music being released by American bands today. What ever happened to originality? Whatever happened to playing music with balls? Why is soul-less pop the rage today? Is this what we've come to? Is this a reflection of the new blandness of the American character? This band shows no originality, no kinetic energy at all. I give them two stars because the musicianship is halfway decent. A surprising number of Seattle music fans who consider themselves hip and musically sophisticated are settling for the sort of drivel put out by this and other mediocre rock bands. Is there any good new American music out there? Come on folks! I mean -- there is nothing cool about this music at all! END"
2,"Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained."
1,"I'm torn between giving this book one star for making me depressed and giving the book five stars for how well written and how honest the book is. All in all, the book deserves the classic status it has attained, but do to how the story made me feel, I had to throw my copy away. I am not a reader that will say a simple ""this book sucks"" but this book made me feel bad. The truth behind the tale disturbed me. That was probably the point trying to be made, but even so, I cannot get by how it made me view the world at the end."
2,I knew he would do it. it is long over due for people to stop looking at Ray J as Brandy's little brother and as his own individual person i give this album five fat stars i like this whole cd but my favorite song is Melody and it's exactly about the title I love this song too because I am a singer too and I love music so i get where he is coming from this song is beautiful!!!!!!
1,"This book does not have line numbers. In addition, the pages don't have the scene or act number on them. So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there. This book makes it difficult to follow with others in class and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,"My old stereo amp was going to die, so I needed a replacement.All I need was a simple stereo amp and this product seemed to be the best fit with great price!Well, it has automatic power on/off function based on the input.So, when there's no input, it turns off automatically to save power.The problem is, even if you turn off the function, it still works so basically it turns on and off all the time while I listen the music.It could have been a great one if it did not have this quality issue.I am returning the product."
1,"I'm sorry to every Claymate out there but Clay Aiken isn't really my type. He's annoying, whiny, and not meaningful. It seems like hes marketing to 5th graders and his mom. Invisible is NOT a meaningful love song, its just pure pop. If you want to listen to meaningful male vocals, I would suggest Coldplay, Keane, or Alexi Murdoch.I do think that Clay Aiken has a good voice for Broadway or theater, but when he produces an over the top pop album such as this, he's wasting his talent."
2,"Of Mice and Men was required reading in my senior year of high school. I'm now more then 20 years out of school, and have yet to read a book more satisfying. I was so touched by Of Mice and Men. The men were so bonded in life. It makes the ending shocking, but understood. A grown strong masculine man, with any feeling would get emotional reading, Of Mice and Men. Totally captivating.Valerie George (gardner@twd.net)"
1,"The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
2,"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."
1,"Okay. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere was suitably claustrophobic. The background music fit the feel of the movie. The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the ""heroine"". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . .."
1,really disappointment since the way they arrived was horriblei was trying reach them since couple of days no responsei recommend not to go ahead with this product..
2,Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.
1,"You'll have read all the reviews about the quality of the light from the Softlighter, which is astonishing. The best. Good enough for Annie L. But I've just ordered my third of these (had the smallest available, the largest and have just bought the 46in sized) and each of them, without question, has broken after only a handful of shoots. The build quality and finish is shockingly poor and I would seriously consider a purchase of a Photek Softlighter for this reason - they have repeatedly let me down on shoots."
1,"Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
2,"One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is clich, that's what this is."
2,"Very nicely constructed, and the service from the seller was truly rare in it's excellence and personally professionaly touch.The zafu was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but it was exactly what it should have been. It was my expectation that was off. Great item."
1,"I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please....."
1,"I'm a HUGE Jet Li fan. I love great kung fu movies. This is not one. There is NO kung fu at all. The rest is a surreal dream that includes a guy chained to a boulder and a guy that gets stabbed and asks why he was assassinated. It may be worth a laugh, but that's a stretch."
1,"Well, I was worried when I read the review saying they didn't fit over large hands. I have pretty large hands and I had no trouble getting them on. However, they started leaking sand during the first use! I can't recommend these. I'll use them until they fall apart which probably won't be too many weeks."
2,"I enjoyed this book tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a story that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf."
1,"I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it."
1,"This would be a fine product except for the fact that it has this mechanism to cut sound output when the sound level falls below a certain threshold. There is a switch to turn off this ""feature"" but it doesn't work. The result is that the sound always cuts off when your music volume gets low. It's extremely irritating when you're trying to listen to the soft parts of songs or when you don't want to blast the output. I want control my volume via remote, buy I have to manually adjust the volume knob instead and when I don't feel like cajoling the amp, I just let the music periodically cut out but get irritated every time it does. I would not recommend this product as a result of this problem."
2,I think the rabbit part is kind of bothersome and I thought the actual shaft would vibrate not just the rabbit. WEIRD.
1,"I realise this is a childrens film... but it's dire. Like scream out loud dire. And long enough to make you wonder 'why did I just waste a significant part of my life to this?' The first half is pretty decent but then come the battle scenes. Moronic tosh. Oh so many pregnant pauses - mid battle - while people stop and gaze in to the distance... so many blatant copies of Lord Of The Rings scenes but without the style or competence... so many opportunities to kill the bad guy which are not taken... I walked away from the TV multiple times because it was, well, so crap. Frustrating crap at that. Avoid at all costs and watch LOTR instead."
1,"Followed the instructions on fluffing, still the pillow is terrible. Purchased a pair of down pillows from Sam's for $16/pair, this horrific investment cost around $45 and I don't use it at all. Stay away."
2,I love love love this CD. I dont speak french but its still great. I would recommend this CD to everyone.
2,Arrived safe and sound and in a timely manner. Nice addition to my ever-growing classic movie library!
2,"I have read this book slowly and thoughtfully, letting Jesus' words sink in. This book has helped me to really grasp much of what Jesus meant in his stories. I will read this again and again."
1,"The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. The novelty wore off after the first play through and it soon went from quick, quirky, and interesting to obnoxious, and boring. Perhaps this just isn't my style of music but I heard a lot of good things about this album and figured I'd give it a try. I found myself enjoying her biography a lot more than her album."
2,This was one of the most simple and cost saving things I have done. instructions were exact and took longer to put cover back on vs. change the part.
2,"If you want to listen to rich music, full of life and rythm...this is it. Will make you want to get up and dance. Great from begin to end."
2,"I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. I would rate if 5 stars if it had any headstand prep work."
2,I didn't know much about this Anime and only bought it because it looked somewhat interesting. What a great surprise! Don't let the cover fool you. It is a quiet anime but without making you want to go to sleep. It has a fantasy side to it but in a realistic way (if that makes any sense to you). It's very emotional..so prepare yourself for that. I recommend having some kleenex around while watching this series.
1,"I have a weakness for Julie Garwood books, and repurchased this book in Kindle format after buying the original version many years ago. While there are a few formatting errors, there is also a gap in content starting at location 5869. It appears there are several pages missing. Extremely annoying -- will be returning this book."
2,"Containing classics ""Never Let Me Down"" and ""Strangelove"", this is an album that has a number of more famous Depeche Mode tracks. A good buy if you like the style."
1,We have yet to receive them?? We are still waiting on this product to arrive. We typically are very happy.
2,"WHERE IS IT? IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, FOR THIS GEM TO COME OUT ON DVD. THIS IS THE BEST SCORPS VIDEO THEY MADE! NOW THAT THEY ARE CALLING IT QUITS, THEIR VIDEOS ARE ALL WE WILL HAVE LEFT! WHATEVER COMPANY OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THIS,... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"
1,"This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
1,"I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip."
1,"I've now been through three of these cords. they seem to last around a year before just dying. The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer, however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall. The little indicator just fades out, and now won't come on at all. Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better. I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well."
1,"I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really."
1,"In the past year, I've come to appreciate and only purchase the Pampers brand for my growing daughter's needs. After reaching 15 months of age, however, the diaper wasn't able to keep hold up to overnight use and I started using a nighttime diaper from a different manufacturer. As grandmothers and others watch the baby, they don't know which diaper to use at which time, so I've completely switched from Pampers to another more sturdy brand that doesn't leak and doesn't cause wet mornings."
2,"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."
1,I should have recognized that given the age of this film that the DVD print would be of such low quality
2,"I've owned this ball about 6 weeks now and I use it as my desk ""chair"". The wonderful dark purple color looks great in my office and it was very easy to blow up with the included pump. Durable so far--I've taken it to a weekend training and back with no problems and after the initial ""breaking in"" period, I've only had to add air once--as I expected. I am very sensitive, but detected little or no odor when I opened the package. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that they include a plastic tool to ease out the stopper. I had one from a previous ball and it works more easily than a coin."
1,"Jeez, was this book strange! By looking at all these great reviews, I felt I had to add my opinion. Steinbeck's a talented writer, that's obvious from the first page. But it had no plot or anything.I guess you either love it or hate it."
1,"We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there."
1,"I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking."
1,"Well, this has to be one of the most disappointing releases of the year. Actually, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't that disappointed, but to fans of Clay, I will warn you that this CD is not what you would expect. Clay sounds more robot than man on this debut effort, and I do mean EFFORT. He is a good singer, but he belongs on Broadway, singing show tunes to the elderly who can revel in his youth and energetic manner. To the average listener, this CD is no more than a sad recycled mess of false emotion. It wouldn't matter so much if it were on Broadway, because the show distracts you somewhat, but I would be careful putting this disc in your CD player. I got a headache after the first song. Anyone want to buy a used copy? I might have to take the scissors to it otherwise..."
2,"Before i bought it, I saw many reviews said that the steamer is too thin. But it's better than my expectation. I can use it to steam as well as make soup. The steamer is perfect. The only short point is that it's too small. It's at most for two persons."
1,"I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,"The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at ""Dollar General"". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift."
2,I knew this would be great. He has such an awesome voice. He can make any song great. This is the best cd I have purchased in years.
2,"A series of books that I pass on to others because there are so good. Thank you so much Lynn for writing this book series, it is one of my favorites. It taught me so much in history and of God's Word. I likely would read them again. Our entire family of 5 has enjoyed them and my 16 year old son has it down as his favorite book series. I highly recommend these books."
1,"Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron."
1,So much for hoping Capcom would have learned it's lesson from the first Outbreak game. Nothing was improved in this chapter. This game still has the same stupid A.I. and annoying real time window that made the first game horrible. Not to mention the characters' audio and text often times don't correlate. Zombies popping up at random times just helped to compound frustration levels. Probably most disappointing is the lack of suspense and creepy atmosphere that made many Resident Evil predecessors so great.
2,Humble genius he was. I loved this autobiography and wish that he had covered more of his involvement in politics in and the American Revolution.
1,These were way to expensive and I cannot believe that I bought these. You might as well as get a piece of tape and try to use that. It will be just as effective. Which means not at all. go with sally hansens. do not buy from here.
1,"I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one."
1,"This was by far the stupidest movie I've seen this year. Keanu Reeves proves yet once again that he's one of the authors of how to be a one-dimensional actor (see all the usually mediocre movies that he's done, such as Speed or one of The Matrix sequels if you don't believe me), second only to Vin Diesel (TWO DAYS. dUR-HUR-HUR!!1!111!!1!!). OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund."
1,"This looked so cool, I thought my kids would love it. But the gum base is impossible to stir - you need to nuke it for way longer than it says to and then it hardens up and is impossible to work with. It becomes hard and brittle rather than smooth and workable. Save your money and don't bother with this! My kids were totally disappointed!"
1,it doesn't get hot enough and has much less wattage than my old one. Where can I find one a better one???
1,I bought this power adapter and it worked just fine at first. I took good care of it and after about six months it just stopped working.
1,"the pages were seperating from the binder and the price on the cover was blackened out, small tear on front cover."
1,"While regarded as a ""classic"" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."
1,"When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in ""Diary"" or ""LP2"" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."
2,"I ordered it and it came in 2 days . works as promised ,now I am totally wiresless and my tivo works great. would definately reccommend this to anyone using this service"
2,"I got this for my daughter she had to do a book report on a historical fiction book, she loved this book just as I did at her age."
2,"she is angela jackson from woodside california, by way of chicago, by way of woodville mississipi, born from the goddess...her poems speak blues, religion, jazz, down-home cooking, long lasting sugar kisses and journeys by astral travelling. she is a spider walking across the face of history a spook opening her heart to reveal her family secrets...this book is poignant, powerful, sexy, and shows the capabilities of lamguage when placed with someone who has respect for it....very few poetry books have moved me...this one does...."
2,"I cannot tolerate pharmaceutical statins and this product gives me excellent results without side effects, been using it for many years."
2,"Listen, as great three masted sailing ships take to the sky, cargo holds packed with winged sheeps and the fabulous flying Frombork. Sky pirates appear of the port bow, and only Captain Jack with his Lightning Sword and magical Top Hat can save the day.The Incredible Adventures of Jack Flanders is an enchanting audio fantasy. It is packed with High Adventure and Magic, and a fair amount of wisdom. The story begins when Jack recieves a Large Overstuffed Green Velvet chair in the mail. At midnight, when he slumbers in the chair, his mind travels to the fantastic realms of the Nevermind. His travels take him aboard the Sky Galleon ""Blue Swallow,"" where he clashes swords with the pirate queen ""The Black Mona Lisa."" He encounters Little Freida, with the piggy tales and havana cigars. He travels to the Velvet Realms and bargins with the Lords of Death.A very satisfying adventure."
2,"This book was truly inspiring. Instead of giving us the same bunch of hogwash about all the things that might help you through menopause, it lists only the things that have been clinically proven with good scientific studies. And the author manages to get this complex (and important) information across with lots of warmth and personal presence. You really feel like you're in her living room talking to her about what really helps get rid of hot flashes or insomnia or a lack of sex drive -- not just what we've already read about over and over."
1,"This is one of those books that leaves you feeling as though you have had several hours of your life stolen from you, and sadly will never get the time back. The characters in the book do not keep in character. Not many pious devout priests would just decide to fornicate and not feel any guilt,or overnight completely lose faith. Berry did a reasonably good job of researching the Marian apparitions, and Vatican terminology, but he knows absolutely nothing of Catholic theology. Shame on whatever Catholic schools ""educated"" him. They failed. As another reviewer aptly put it, the ending was so blasphemous that it was almost humorous. Don't waste your time."
1,"TOOOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT. Reading this book, I found myself saying, ""GET TO THE POINT."" The plot of the story was nice (sort of), but it needed more action. In the beginning and towards the end there was too much talk about what I already heard over and over before. What really bothered me was that one character's point of view, didn't really give me an understanding of the other characters (especially Adrian).Before reading this book the title caught my attention. The title was really a big let down because there was not much ""Hell Breaking Loose."" Borrow this book from a friend and please don't ever buy the hard back."
2,"everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!"
2,Love that I discovered the option of purchasing diapers on Amazon!!!! They state that they are used but are perfectly fine. THANK YOU THANK YOU
2,"it fit good. took only about 30 mins to put on. little quiter than i wanted,( but for the price can't beat it ).it is getting a littler louder everyday i drive it, starting to burn some of the glass packing out."
2,"I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!"
2,Its a sad but very good book I think it was writen well. I am yet a middle schooler and like this book you might as well read it now and read it again in high school any way good book.
1,"A very nice movie. Overall audio is okay but the center channnel is soft on output. Whisper can hardly be heard. Dolby TrueHd is average. Switched to Dolby Digital, less compressed. Gabriel wing flaps can be heard. Now the center channel is much better. Visual just okay. Its a 50G disc."
2,"Flying dagger is one of the funniest movie I have seen this year. The main character in the movie seem weaker than Jimmy character. It seem that bad things always happen to the main character. As for Jimmy, he often get to do all the fighting. I think the girls in here are not good looking. Overall the movie have great comedy and the only good looking person in here have to be Jimmy Lin."
2,"These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. They have pockets for the photos rather than those electrostatic pages which makes them far easier to use (in my opinion). They also have space to write notes next to each photo. We liked the one we got for our daughter so much, we bought another when we had our son."
2,The dress was very well made I can not complain about that at all. I knew it was not going to fit when I purchased it based on previous reviews so I expected alterations. But with the money you save the 30 dollars to adjust is nothing.
1,"This edition is basically newsprint with a hard binding. What a racket! Signet Classics (Pocket size) with introduction by Marcelle Clements.Tess of the D'urbervillesAnd the binding is not good, either--don't know what the word for it is but no left margin."
2,This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.
2,Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. I have always been a rock fan except for Albert Lee. His music is so well done and just plain pleasant to listen to that it draws me right in. His guitar skills are as good as anyone in the buisness. His guitar is always there but never overpowering. This CD contains material I originally bought on record more years ago than I'd care to admit. It still sounds as fresh and clean as it did all those years ago. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for dazzling guitar work with a country flavor. His choice of material os first rate and the recording quality of the CD is also first rate. Buy this thing and you'll like it.
2,"But she does a damn good job. And it's obvious that she loves the role and the opportunity to have played her. The negative reviews she's gotten just aren't fair. She certainly gets points for attempting this, and if you'll give the movie half a chance, with an OPEN MIND, she might just prove to you that she's a very good actress.If you're expecting Audrey, or wanting to compare the two of them, that's just not fair to anyone. I'm glad to have seen the story done so well."
1,"I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
1,"So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
1,"If you want to spend $53 for one tiny trash can then this is the deal for you. This product should have been sold as a 6 pack but unfortunately someone messed up when they entered this product for sale. Both Amazon and Geroy's deny responsibility for the error and to date nothing has been changed. It was REALLY disappointing to get this in the mail & then have to turn around and return it. ALSO, you can't return this product without talking with someone at the amazon call center. This purchase was a huge WASTE OF TIME and I'm disappointed that it's still available."
2,"This is a wonderful book, I highly recommend it. Exhaustively referenced, with many hard-to-find images. This book will fascinate a wide range of people, from those interested in Art History to those interested in the occult. The writing style is colloquial, but intelligent, offering a new perspective on American History. Don't hesitate to buy it."
2,"I have been waiting for this CD forever!!! Finally was able to get it, and wondered, ""Where is that booming, powerful voice"" that Clay had on American Idol? The songs are nice, and he has a nice voice, but NOT THE CLAY that was on the AI program. I loved how he belted out his songs....this CD does not have that part of his voice. Disappointed in that, but overall, the CD is good."
1,"So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
2,Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves
1,"This is the second catnip product I bought from this company. Still no luck. It was not that easy to grow. The seeds had few sprouts at the beginning, but then they died after few days even you follow the instructions. Not very satisfied with the product."
2,"Filled with emotion, this tribute to the memory of Basie is the perfect way to relax after a long day. I also find the mellow ""vibe"" great background music for creative work."
2,I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
1,"Under the table surface, there are two factory-assembled bars used to connect the four legs. Clearly the bars on my table were misaligned, as they almost stick out of the table surface at one end (I will upload a photo for that), and left no room for the legs. This rendered the whole table useless.It surprised me how such a defected part could get through the manufacturer's quality control. You don't need any fancy tool to discover it. Looking at it would suffice.Finally I chose to fix it myself. It was not very difficult for me, just taking off the 6 screws that hold the bars, realigning the bars to the correct position, and then put the screws back in again. The extra 20 minutes work was still worth it, comparing to repackaging the whole set, the hassle to ask for a return, plus shopping for another table.The quality of the table (other than the misaligned bars) is OK. That's why I still give it two stars. But I would really hesitate to buy again from this manufacturer."
1,thought the product worked great... only problem had was first time was too small...second was that not happy with cost to ship...way overpriced
2,My 18 mo. old twins love the Megaland tent... especially the basketball goal. It is very large when you put it all together so make sure you have a lot of space if you plan to keep it up.
1,This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.
2,This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
1,"Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
1,"This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
1,The book is all nonsense. Want to read a book about Michael? Read Letters to Michael Jackson.
1,"The book was alleged to be ""new"" but the cover showed considerable wear. I think it was probably read and then offered for sale as ""new""."
1,"I'm really upset with myself for not more closely reading the reviews that said there wasn't music, just talking about the songs. I like the Fleetwood Mac, but not personally. I thought I was buying a concert performance with commentary. If you don't get a preview, you don't know what you'll get."
2,This movie is a timeless classic. Jessica Rabbit is still one of the hottest actress in cinama to this day. Excluding Alyson Hannigan and Linda Cardellini. Christopher Lloyde shows he has true gritt.
1,"This book is quite long, has lackluster coverage of major 9.0 features, and has several errors. I found myself trying to use it as a reference guide becuase of the size, but digging around for any useful information was almost always futile. Other books in this series seem to be tighter and more coherent than this overlong book."
1,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."
2,"very interesting book. was one of those you do not want to put down. it gave a different perspective of the happenings of the manson family. however, one must keep in mind it was recorded from what charles manson believed happened. great book."
1,"Yes, System of a Down have made some great songs here on Toxicity, but they have also put out some garbage ones that make you wonder why they even consider these half way decent. The good songs are ones that you still here on the radio quite a bit so by now most people are probably tired of those songs anyway. Overall, the bad stuff heavily outways the good so unless you can get it for cheap I would stay clear."
1,"Update... HP sent me a replacement printer at no charge!My printer did the same thing that so many others here have reported... worked fine for a while and then stopped feeding paper. It seems clear to me (after carefully inspecting and poking at it without disassembling it) that the roller that initially feeds the paper doesn't apply enough pressure. I kept thinking something must have broken, but now I think it is just a bad design and HP should do something about this. My plan is to call them, point out the dozens and dozens of complaints on-line and urge them to replace the darn thing with something that works."
2,Excellent book. I've read all but a few pages. I was very touched by Mr Bok's description of his childhood as a slave. A few years ago I'd heard that the Sudan had some problems; after reading this book I have a little idea of those problems in general and of slavery in particular. I strongly recommend this book.
1,Well let's start with Alagna's darkened voice. I think Roberto may be developing Carreras-Itis. This is cartainly a different sounding Roberto Alagna that I have ever heard. His middle is muddy and his top doesn't ring like in the past. I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era. His Sacred Aria album is much better than this one.
2,This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
2,This film showes the Brits as the Masters of faking out the Crowns Enemies. It also shows that not all the most effective fighting involves fix bayonets and charge.
2,"This was an okay movie. You must enjoy the Bay Transformers Universe in order to enjoy this film. Oh yeah, and big explosions."
2,"My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. It was very outdated. This DVD was great - very current. Yes, some of her jokes were lame and her attempting to be funny gets a little old, but overall it was really a beneficial DVD. It was nice to be able to do it at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home. I would definitely recommend this DVD to expectant parents rather than taking an actual class."
2,Love it! It was easy to setup and connect to my home network with no problems. It also works with my WAP encryption enabled.
2,"Adam Sandler plays a guy that is about to giveup on love until he meets Drew Barrymore whohas a short-term memory loss, where she forgetseverything the next day; she can only rememberanything that has happened before the tragicmoment in her life that messed up her brain."
1,"We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!"
2,"Of mice and men is an awesome book. I thought it would be boring, but even with not much action going on I could hardly put it down. For a book that is only 101 pages long it tells a fantastic story. If you ever want to read this book (which you should)pick a nice summer day, go somewhere where you feel comfortable, and let the book take you to a ranch near Soledad, Ca."
1,This book seems just a vehicle to vent the author's bitterness and is a very poor representation of the experience of Catholic schooling and upbringing. I am saddened to think readers may think it is. It is neither humorous nor entertaining. I read it cover to cover looking for merit and found none. I have to give it a poor rating.
1,"Yuk! is about all I can say. I loved Clay on the show but this cd sounds like one 50 min track. Save your money and get a copy used if you must. They are here for $4. If you bought This Is The Night/Bridge cd single, then you got the best. These people saying Amazing! 5 stars! must be with the Arista marketing team. They must be getting paid to log on reviews. Clay is great and Clay can sing, but this cd has three good tracks."
2,"Of Mice and Men by John SteinbeckThis story is about two men, Lenny and George, trying to make a living on their own. Smart and witty George finds them jobs, while slightly retarded Lenny helps accomplish the work with his ox-body structure. When tragedy hits this motivated duo, Lenny goes into hiding. The book ends in a terribly sad game of cat and mouse.This book was slow-paced at first, but the tables turn as you get further into the story. The characters were well portrayed and the conflicts of the story are exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot thickens after a while and forces you to keep reading; its hard to put this book down! Of you like classics with twists, turns and devestating disaster, this book is for you. I hope you enjoy this novel!"
2,I received this item as promised and enjoy this type of music by mandolins with hymns and it is very relaxing
1,THIS BOOK IS TRASH! WILL YOU PEOPLE NOT SEE THAT THE MAN IS INNOCENT? HE WOULD NEVER EVER EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALL THOSE ACCUSATIONS ARE FALSE AND YOU CRAZY PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS WRONG. yOU ALL JUST NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO JUSTIFY THE FACT THAT YOU STOLE MJ'S LIFE AND MONEY. HIS HARD EARNED MONEY. REMEBER HE STILL HAS REAL FANS AND WE LOVE HIM AND BELEIVE IN HIM. HE IS #1. [...]
1,"After I saw these guys on Conan O' Brien...I could not help to think ""What a rip off...these guys are trying to be this new ""raw simple rock"" so many bands (White Stripes, The Strokes) are doing. This just affirms the whole belief about the time we live in: ""If it was popular once...you will see it again"""
1,"Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."
2,"I am a new mom and have mostly been using Pampers Sensitive diapers and some Huggies. I received a package of these Pampers Baby Dry as a shower gift and recently started using them. They NEVER leak! I have problems with the Sensitive ones leaking, especially overnight for 11 hours. These are thinner and not as bulky and definitely hold the best of anything I've tried thus far."
1,"I was enjoying the author's story but about a quarter of the way through I became embarrassed for her as the author is presenting a racist view point on her story. She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony. If you are that clueless to these types people using you, you need a check up from the neck up. If you want a real story; read Richard Dry's book called Leaving for a true African-American story."
1,"Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4.99, I would not recommend these flannel sheets for purchase because of the very poor sewing workmanship. The stitches were very large, and also some of the edges were simply turned over once and sewn with a raw (easy to unravel) edge. The sheet would not hold up well after the first washing. I resewed all the edges of both sheets."
2,"Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger. Its about $40 cheaper than the apple proprietary version and does the same exact thing -> power my laptop. Its not as fancy looking, however, and the cord is kind of stiff. But if you dont care about that sort of stuff then there is no reason to buy the overpriced apple version."
1,"This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called ""Chopin: The Man And His Music"". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."
1,"Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
1,"If the authors would have told the story like they said it in court then maybe it would be an interesting book but when they change what they previously had stated UNDER OATH just to sell a book than there's no point to read it. This book is obviously just the same old lame story whether you like it or not:""Ex-employee sees the opportunity to make an EASY big bug off his super talented, extraordinary ex-boss.""As you already know, Michael Jackson's success was earned by his hard work and not by writing an untrue book about anyone.It's just sad that to make themselves feel better(or richer)there are people who put down, make up lies about others and take advantage of the success of others to make life easier for themselves. However,there are always people willing to do that like the people that enjoyed reading this book.YOU'RE JUST MAKING THEM RICH..."
2,"Congrats Celine! Again. She made it. Another big success for releasing this new French CD. Debut #1 in Canada, and France. [...]Anyway, she has tried to sing a little bit more rock 'n' rolls kinda style this time. It's a good try for her, but I still like her ballad, and I highly recommend ""apprends-moi"" and ""je t'aime encore ""."
2,"Exciting music, classical yet rock and alternative with a hint of ethnicity! So much to listen for.... and the costumes were sleek and eye catching. Watching them perform on stage is so much fun and they're so energetic! WoW."
2,"I was happy with the book on how to draw but it is for an older child. I'm sure our granddaughter will be able to do the drawing, just not the reading. We will need to help her."
1,"I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
1,The disc was a region 1 and i cudnt watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!! And i could not change my Samsung player to multi region.
2,"This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost)."
1,"It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated."
2,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE FUNKY SIDE OF JIMMY REED, HERE IT IS!JIMMY REED JR. ON THE BASS GUITAR ADDS THE FUNKY TOUCH WITH THE ADDITIONS OF SOME WAH WAH PEDALS ON THE OTHER GUITARS ALSO! ITS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN HIS OTHER MUSIC, BUT ITS IS STILL A GREAT CD!"
1,"This could be a really great item. The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer. The material is not bulky and stays static free. The fit is comfortable enough that I don't notice I'm wearing it under a dress. I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying: the adjustable straps don't stay put. I have to adjust them every time I wash it (where they also become very twisted), every time I put it on or take it off. The straps slip throughout the day as I wear it... you get the idea. The annoyance this poses to me outweighs the other good features that it has. I will ditch it after this winter, unfortunately. If readjusting does not bother you, than there is nothing else wrong with this item."
1,The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
1,"This was the worst product I ever bought. It held up only about 40 days and then, got more inflated on one side then the other. Of course ended in the trash. I have no car, so was very hard for me to return the item, and go to the post office. Waste of money. Do not order from this company ever. BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"The standard lighting (headlights) on our 2001 Ford Ranger was disappointing. As you get older, you come to appreciate better lighting and the factory headlamps are poor. I tried the better bulbs from NAPA without a great improvement. Finally, I ordered the PIAA's and they represent a great improvement; they seem like twice the illumination of standard lighting. I only wish they were available in""off road"" strength."
2,"I HAVE READ ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE STORY OF MANSON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY.I JUDGE ALL AS HUMAN FIRST AND ALL OTHER THINGS ON CHARACTER.I NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A HIPPIE CULT LEADER,NOT THAT HE FORMED THIS FAMILY, AND BELIEVE HE KILLED NO ONE.THIS WAS JEERED BY MANSON HIMSELF BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CLOSEST REVELATION TO EXPOSE THE WAY IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF THE MEDIA.1967, MANSON ASKED NOT TO GO TO SOCIETY.HE MET FEW INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE HE HUNG OUT WITH. HE WAS SHY OF SEX. HE WAS IGNORANT AS TO HOW THINGS WERE. HE WAS INTO BING CROSBY, NOT BEATLES AND HELTER SKELTER.ONE OF THE GIRLS CREATED THAT BY HERSELF.IF IT HAD STAYED IN WHAT WAS HIS RELEASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN O.K. BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE JOINED THEM AND THE LOVE AND PEACE ERA, REVOLVED TO BIKERS, WEAPONS ,THEFTS. THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN. TRYING TO KEEP UP EXSISTANCE, SOME PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY. THEY BRANCHED OUT, BROUGHT OTHERS IN AND CHAOS EVOLVED."
2,"Really hits home with a clear explanation on why companies fail. I was taken by the accuracy of what happens to companies living the economic model, after they go through a downsizing. His core premise of the company being a collection of human communities is right on. It is the first work which I have read that ""humanizes"" the corporate entity by calling it what it really is. A look at corporations beyond the bean-counter would be an appropriate sub-title for this work."
2,"Before I bought this album I only knew two Sparta songs. When I heard they were going to play again after 4 years of not doing so this past November 17, 2011, I bought this album. It is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I keep listening to it from beginning to end and they are even more amazing live! I have not heard their other two albums but after listening to this one I can tell you I'll be doing so soon."
2,These videos are fabulous my daughters and I learned how to sew using only these videos. My daughters have surpassed me in sewing. I thank God for Pam's williness to use her skill to make videos for those who never was taught the skill of sewing. May God bless her business.
1,"Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"
2,This is a great book that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50's
2,"I would highly suggest this game to anyone who loves simulation management games. If you liked Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon, you'll love Virtual Resort: Spring Break.It has 11 or 12 levels in which you go through and fix several problems given a selected amount of time. It's a little rough but very addicting!! And in no time you're figure out what to do and be successful. With every level you complete you unlock that island to play in sandbox mode for later on.I give the game 5 stars for good graphics, fun play and ease of use!! Check it out!!"
1,"This worked for about a month, then the scanner function ceased to work except by accessing it through the computer, in other words, you couldn't put a photo in it and push the scan button but had to go thru the computer. Now even that doesn't work. The troubleshooting they have is extremely complicated/pure gibberish.What a piece of junk."
1,When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero.
2,"Although this CD has been out a while, I just purchased it. WoW!I was blown away. Johnny Zoot really rocks. I especially liked the note he sang on Cobwebs. The lyrics and feel makes me sad but that is a testament to the strong emotions which Jonathan Zoot summons from the bottom of his soul.This band would have been one of the tops in the 40's and should be today with the fine musicianship and bass/vocal prowess of J. Zoot.I have a small dentist practice in my town and have made my patients listen to this when they are tied in their chairs and they almost never complain.Thanks Zoot people."
1,The DVD did not play on my American DVD player. It would really nice if this compant pointed out that this DVD is British and not calibrated for US DVD machines.It was a DVD for an assignment that set me back with little time to find a copy to complete my assignment. I will not order from this compant again.
1,I was very disappointed in this book. I collect Westmoreland Milk Glass - primarily the grape panel pattern. There was very little in this book on milk glass. A true Westmoreland Glass book would have a great bit of it in there.
1,I had the printer for one month before the paper feed problems occurred. I went to tech support and after they asked me re-register for the THIRD time I threw the printer out the window (literally). No HP for me!
1,"This thing looks good in the pictures, but I immediately regret only reading the first few reviews. The negative reviews are 100% correct. I had this thing delivered on 2/16/12, and I threw it away yesterday (3/4/12), as it was cracked, peeled, and starting to mold. Do Not Buy this item."
2,"I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
1,"The worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. First it wasn't even the ball I bought. It was a Diff. model than the one shown on the screen. The ball has stupid Cartoon Characters doing exercises on the ball, which I now realize that you show a diif. ball because that one would never sell. Do not buy this ball save your money."
1,"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
1,"headphones need to withstand at least some not so ideal conditions. my AKGs and Sennheisers have survived more than 25 respectively 15 years of use. sometimes they got dropped or i fell asleep while wearing them. and they still serve me well 'til this day and still sound perfect. not so the Bose set i bought in 2004. in 2005 the plastic parts holding the ear pieces to the frame broke. i fixed them on one side just to see them break on the other. then the plastic skin covering the foam padding started to come off. apart from being annoying, the chemical stench coming from the foam was sickening. i gave up on repairing the set and just recently tossed it in the trash bin promising myself never to touch Bose, ever, ever again. i am happy with a cheap Koss set now that at a fraction of the price sounds about as good and it still works."
2,I like the subject-not a lot of fiction covering these not so popular Biblical kings. I liked the writing style but the story telling seemed a little slow. I am hoping the second book will be where the action is.
1,"Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as ""common sense."""
2,"Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug.Whether he wanted to make money or just expand his horizons, it really doesn't matter.He formed this band, Harlem River Drive, in 1970, and made one hell of an album. Truth be told, this project does not have much to do with the Latin Jazz Eddie is known for. Harlem River Drive is an out and out soul funk album: wha whas, grooving percussion, all the ingredients you would expect from a crack unit during the era.And more: with a baritone sax--an extremely underused instrument in all genres--in front, this album has a uniquely jazzy flavor, even though the beats could be off a Santana or War or Mandrel album.As funk, it works full bore, but the novel textures here make an already fantastic funk project so much more."
1,I was very disappointed with this book. I found the heroine to be too childish and tedious; she fought over everything and after a while it became annoying. His brother Rafael should have been the hero - he had more guts!
2,"Once again Pitchshifter seems to have outdone themselves. With cuts like ""Hidden agenda"" and ""Condescension"" How can one go wrong. With Pitchshifter's hard-edged combination of punk, techno, and metal; and the brutal social commentary, this easily became one of my favorties."
2,"This book is definitely an ""In Your Face"" program. Each chapter presents full frontal examination of your Spirituality.Unless you do the exercises at the end of each chapter, you are missing the full benefit of the book.I highly recommend you use this book in a class or at least working with one other person to discuss what comes up for you."
2,"Some people call it cheap and flimsy. But I call it thin and delicate. and that's how it should be when you're opening a wine bottle. It is extremely easy to pop out the cork with this corkscrew. It also works with synthetic corks. No extra strength required at all. Believe me you'll be amazed after using this product. It comes with a nice container, which is a bonus."
1,Well after my first one started turning itself off and requiring unplugged rest time before it would come back on I called Samsung. They shipped me a refurbished replacement and it worked for four days. Now it won't display anything. On to replacement number two...
1,"This product is a good idea however:1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.2. Can't be put in the Micro.3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open).5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product!"
2,"1984 is about a man named Winston Smith and the totalitarian society he lives in. Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today."
2,I read the book The Castle in the Attic and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part was when William meets Sir Simon and sees the castle. I like this part because William gets scared and drops him on the floor. Will they become friends or not? Find out by reading the book.
2,"""I hope this book will never be read."" So begins Yourcenar's Fires...a richly dense collection of famous myths and legends stunningly revitalized through the voices and eyes of the heroines. Intertwining the stories are excerpts from Yournenar's own journal taken from the time during which she had written the stories. Achingly familiar to anyone recovering from a broken heart, Yourcenar marries the heartache of this century's woman to women throughout the ages."
2,"As usual, wonderful stories of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. One gets involved in his novels and will just want to read more about this time period and being part of the sealore!"
2,"The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall."
1,"they did not let me leave comment on pampers size 5 not the baby dry but cruiser i just bought size five and there is NO MESH LINER! I contacted pampers and this is their response:I'm sorry for the confusion. Sometimes we try new features on our diapers which result in different versions being on store shelves at the same time. I understand your frustration since you're not able to tell which package has the style you prefer, and I'm sharing your feedback with the rest of our team.hmmm....how about I want my MONEY BACK?"
2,"What can you say about one of the greatest minds of the last two centuries? Well, you don't have to say anything, just listen to the author. One minute care free, the next anal retentive. And vain? Me, myself and I, we get along so well. I'm still trying to figure out if I would have liked Franklin in person, but I certainly have no regrets about getting to know him better. Should be required reading."
2,"This is a very well done dramatization of the game...not that the series only encompasses the first of the three games, however it does so faithfully...they even manage to get in most of even the most unbelievable special attacks in a fun scene...I highly recommend this set for fans and newbies alike..."
2,"Dharma Bums is a beautiful story, though there's no real plot to speak of -- no damsel in distress, no hero facing adversity, no complicated twists . . . it's just about life.The reader follows the typical Kerouac rucksacker as he floats along in his mid-twenties -- hiking the mountains of the west coast, thumbing his way across the country and swapping spiritual observations with Zen enthusiast and companion Japhy Ryder.This book is a treasure, reminding the reader of the subtle beauties in nature, conversation, travel and friendship. It's a perfect fit for any fan of life."
1,"First I am disappointed that Amazon makes you give at least one star. My advise on this sorry excuse for a printer is to save your money...save yourself from more gray hairs...save your kids from having to hear you yell obscenities...and don't buy this piece of junk! Unless you enjoy having to load each sheet of paper one at a time every time you print, all the time in hopes that it will take the paper and not jam. If that sounds like fun - then my friend...this is the printer for you! Me on the other hand, I will never own another HP."
2,"works great to keep my coffee warm at my desk. Now I don't have to go to the microwave all morning to warm my coffee. Doesn't keep the coffee really hot, but hot enough."
2,"""Intolerance is a thing that causes war, pogroms, crucifixions, lynchings, and makes people cruel to little children and to each other. It is responsible for most of the viciousness, violence, terror, and heart and soul breaking of the world."" -page 226 in the 1998 Perennial Classics (excerpt from 13 year old Francie Nolan's diary)This quote is what I believe to be the most powerful. It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever. It made the novel for me."
1,"The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating. Luckily I have the print version and could figure out what was going on. I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed."
2,I don't think I can say anymore about this than hundreds of other readers have already mentioned. It's a classic and rightfully so. But will Big Brother eventually take over our lives? You be the judge.
2,"With this tool you can keep your mini blinds really clean, the brush reaches into those impossible crevices. And I now dust my blinds on a regular basis to keep them looking really great. I was most pleased with this product, especially since it saves me those extra steps of cleaning!!"
2,"This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
1,"its unbelievable to me that you still have this available to purchase. After 9/30/01, you cannot use this, so why is it on sale still? and why is it going off the market? Its a great idea, I hope someone else picks up where sony leaves off."
1,"To be honest, between the forced dialogue and the constant, graphic child abuse scenes, there's not a lot of content here. In fact, I dare say the abuse doesn't even progress the story, but uses shock value to keep readers interested. The love is fake, the story never has any hope, and the ending is an outrage. Nothing is solved, nothing is concluded - it's all just so the author can sell the next book. No, thank you."
2,"I loved the book! I had to read it for english and it was an in class assignment so we read thru it together. The 2 main characters, George and Lennie, go from town to town looking for work. most people think that it's weird that 2 men would travel together(not that way). Everyone thinks that George is taking Lennie's pay check and using to go to town and use it for the whorehouse. It had vivid descriptions and pictures that I had acutally thought I had lived and worked with them. It does have some foul language, but if you focus on the language then you will not be able to read thru it and feel the emotion. Also if a 12 year old could read it then most likely anyone could. The book covers the following topics: life in the early century (30's), racial prejudice, prostitution, and the all american dream. There's also a tear-jerking ending so be forewarned. Overall, (obviously) I loved it!!!"
2,"(...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource."
2,"I was buying this as a gift and I was looking for a zen garden that was big enough to be a decorative piece for a table, but small enough for an end table. It was also a very good price. I was very happy with this purchase."
1,"First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. Secondly, we've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring. We've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh. It's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all. Once it was on it really didn't do what it is supposed to do - it's more awkward than anything. Definitely would not recommend."
1,"This is a beautiful fragrance for those who adore something heavy, almost syrupy, to wear. It's a very deep, sweet and spicy scent, kind of like Estee Lauder's Spellbound, which is also too heavy for my own personal taste. But some people review this most enthusiastically, so it's worth giving it a try. The price is right, so not a huge loss if it doesn't do it for you."
2,"Although some of the chapters were redundant, The Greatest Generation is a great lesson in history and should be required reading in every high school and college throughout this nation. Then maybe...just maybe we Baby-boomers, and Generation X'ers and Angsters and Ganstas and the self-righteous, and selfish, and self-indulgent, and self-pitying might return to a value system based on responsibility, work, selflessness, fairness, commitment, honesty, and loyalty."
1,All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from.
2,"Very humorous, although I would have liked a little more between the sheets. Okay plot, but the characters were likable enough for me to recommend it for a ""quick"" read. Also, let me recommend one I just finished, The Color of Revenge. Hot, hot, hot!"
2,"This is used for when my older son has friends stay over night. It's easy to set up, and comfortable. Does the job flawlessly."
1,"When i received the movie, it wouldnt play in any of the dvd players that we have in the house,,i think the movie was a fake!!!!"
1,"I bought this box to store my old sketchbooks in. I was misled by another reviewer who claimed that the box was dust and water-proof, THIS IS FALSE! The cover is cheap plastic that pops into the base by two bulb-shaped hinges. There are large, open gapes between the cover and the base when it's closed, offering absolutely no protection from dust and moisture whatsoever. The handles broke the first time I lifted it (cheap plug-in type connector / hinge). The only thing this box is good for is a trash-can."
1,"I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new. If you read the book description that is displayed above, there is no more need to buy this book.Her point: modern judges are doing a bad job because the interpret the constitution instead of listening to the majority."
2,"For an album recorded nearly 1/2 a century ago (December 1956), Swinging Kicks doesn't sound outdated. The sound quality, while not up to today's digital perfection, is still quite listenable. The playing is awesome (lotsa power!), but what do you expect from guys like Maynard, Bud Shank, Ben Webster, etc. According to the liner notes, the tunes come from a film Buddy scored called The Wild Party (unfamiliar to me). Interestingly, some charts have 2 pianos (Andre Previn and Paul Smith). Originally produced by Norman Granz, 40 minutes. By the way, Buddy has a web site up with some interesting remembrances of his Songbook recordings with Ella - check it out."
2,"This was a very interesting book. As I read it I felt like Toad was a `Prodigal Son', who came back only far enough to receive acceptance, then returned to his bad habits till he was in trouble again.It reminded me much of myself, playing at being Christian before really giving Christ all areas of my life. Like Toad I would repent, but then not really change.Rat was wise and resourceful, Mole was tender and caring and awe-full like a child yet also very wise. Badger is like a wise mature old mentor or guide, sent to give direction, and lead one to find one's own purpose in life.Yet the mix of Animal and Human society just did not make sense to me. It felt like a badly planned Narnia novel. It did not explain how the animal and human worlds came to interact and share a language or culture.But over all it was a fun read even if dry in some spots.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"
1,"Amazon.com doesn't tell you whether or not any of the episodes you purchase contain the music performances, no matter how much i liked. i primarily downloaded the episode because i wanted the MUSICAL PERFORMANCES, not the rest of the show! I finally downloaded the episodes and i can confirm that it does not contain any of the music performances on that particular episodes, which is a great disappointment."
2,"Product as described and as assumed. Assumptions? Well, the build quality sucks but it looks that way in the pictures. Also, it does take 20 minutes to cook a hotdog but it cooks very evenly.Also one thing to note, when you pull the hotdogs right out of a package, they are squarish, not perfectly round. So they don't roll very well until the hotdogs heat and start plumping up. You sort of need to give the hotdogs a turn or two until they start plumping up and rolling on their own. I would suggest buying hot dogs in a different packaging.Overall, good product and makes good tasting hotdogs. Easy to clean."
2,"What a great movie!! Much better than the first, the action is awesome, the scenery beautiful, the music just wonderful, and the actors were, as always, brilliant. I just loved this film and how the characters came together at the end to fight the Talmarians. There were a few bothering scenes as when Caspian and Peter would fight, but Susan's character was great. At one point it reminded me of Legolas fighting and Lucy looks so grown up and her character's growth from the first film is very nicely done. Edmund fights more in this film and he's also great, his character comes full circle as you'll see and the horse shots were some of my favorites as well. A must buy for anyone!!"
2,My family and I listened to this book on tape when we were driving across the country. It was so fun we didn't want to turn it off. It's about a boy who figures out what's in your heart mattters most. It has a great moral and is very exciting. I recommend this book for everyone.
2,"Silkk should have named his cd after his ever popular song,""He did that."" The Cd is off the chain. The first single was just a preveiw of the great songs that awaited you on this cd.Popular cuts such as,"" He did that"",""That's Cool"",""Seem like a thug"",&""Theme boys"" make this cd a hit.And keeping in the same Silkk tradition, Silkk always offer a song on his cd that touches the heart. On this cd that song is ""What's Heaven Like"". In This crazy mixed up world It's good to know that rappers can relate to God, even though they always appear to be bad guys. That just goes to show the media is not always right, they have feelings just like everyone eles!!!"
2,This diaper is very thin but it absorbs really well. It beats Huggies and Costco brand. My son's diaper rash is gone after using this.
2,Sweatsuit was the best remake of a cd ive ever listened to. with fly away from the longest yard soundtrack Grillz feat paul wall ali and gipp .. Tired with avery storm.. a slow song in which nelly is talkin about a relationship. and nasty girl.. a little on the adult side in nelly's rap but its a great song dont get me wrong. and you can forget all the good songs like over and over my place na-nana-na n dey say and many more great tracks from sweat and suit. it is a great Cd. i gave it 5 stars because i think its amazing!
2,"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a short, but entertaining novel. The book takes place in the 1930's with the 2 main characters John and Lennie traveling to a ranch to work, save up money and live their dream. Lennie is a big guy that is a little slow in the mind, and has an obsession with petting soft things. George is a small guy that has known Lennie for a long time and gives him commands for Lennie doesn't know what to do by himself. Much like a Father-son relationship.I usually don't like fiction tales that take place in the past,but I enjoyed this one. The only problem is that the book starts out slow. It gives you clues that keeps you guessing and wondering.For all you readers that consider yourself a slow reader, this is a great book for you. It's exciting and short. Only 107 pages. The price on the book is 8 bucks. I think it's worth it."
2,"This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about ""Creatures Of The Night"" :)"
2,A LOVE SUPREME: an essential piece of recorded music that belongs in everyone's collection. timeless and sacred beauty in every note.
1,My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
2,The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
2,This hockey game actually gives the player a challenge. You will not be able to score all the time like other hockey games and sweeping teams through the Stanley Cup Play-offs will not be easy at all. Hockey fundamentals come into play with this game and you must know how to run a power play. Great game!
2,This is Bernie Taupin's second solo album and it is excellent.From the rockers Born on the fourth of July to his smooth ballads Venezuela and Love(the barren desert). This is a great album for anyone who has followed Elton and Bernie's career.
1,"Not being a woman, or a midwife, or a semi-witch, or a southerner, I'm sure I missed something about this book. It wasn't necessarily bad - I can appreciate the craftsmanship of the text - it just really didn't speak to me on a personal level. Still, not a bad read for a rainy afternoon."
2,"but we especially enjoy having our oatmeal ready for us in the morning--cooked prefectly. This machine is capable of cooking many types of grains, and it is very easy to clean."
1,"The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers. There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories. In a complete version, it's a four-star book."
2,Best game ever buy it fun caracter switch select button item select R button Password mondo mountain XGVXHQWS. If you want to win consantraitI have 10 passwords the mondo mountain password is above.The best game ever $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it now worth the $$$$$$$$$$$$ buy it when you can!!!
2,This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
2,As advertised. Took a half hr. to install. Nothing to it. My local car repair shops wanted $250 for it in addition $180-$250 in labor. Omg. I saved $300 doing the job myself and not paying the markup. Works well am I do not regret it.
1,I purchased this for my sony camcorder. I have windows XP on my laptop and this cable does not work. My laptop does not even detect my camcorder when attached.............Its a waste according to me
1,"The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
2,"I have two sandisk cruzer flash drives, and i have to say, they're great. The first one i got has been with me for years, and it's still working great.The retractable usb connector elliminates the need of a cap, so you never have to worry about loosing it. The materials are very high quality, and the U3 software is usefull for some applications.In my opinion, this is the best usb flash drive out there.I actually started trusting sandisk after this, and went to the store to buy a sansa e260, wich is great too."
1,"This junk really stinks (literally, it smells horrible)!! I've used better products and those other attractants did trigger responses in females. I've been INSULTED by the females at my job after using alter ego and been told things like ""what in the world is that new cologne you're wearing, it doesn't smell good"". I told my wife I was wearing a new type of ""after shave"" and she hates it so much I had to promise NOT to wear it to bed. Don't believe the hype of Alter Ego, there are far far far better Pheromones. It's apparent they tried to give it a MASCULINE tone, but they went too far."
1,"I have listened to it several times. Each time I read the reviews here people keep saying you need to listen to it over and over to like it. Well, I've listened to it over and over and I now have a headache. This isn't music folks and it is a sad tone-deaf society who thinks this CD is good. I want my money back!!!! I am beginning to believe that multiple purchase campaign thing about this CD, I hope to God there aren't 838,000 fools out there. Hopefully only 100,000 people purchased multiples with only a few suckers (like me) in between."
1,I was FORCED to read this book in school! It was pure TRASH! I thought I liked reading... well now Idont! Thanks a lot Ray Bradbury!!!
1,"The product is very bad. The spot weld connecting the metal hoop to the main upright failed, and one of the support rods sprung free when the connecting screw stripped the threads holding it. This all occurred after only using this product three times. The pieces are in my garage waiting to be disposed of. Don't waste your money.Joe G."
2,"This book was amazing. I found it when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes years ago. Dr. Bernstein has a somewhat radical idea that instead of letting blood sugar peak and then pull it back down with meds or insulin is dangerous long term. His idea of controlling and achieving normal blood sugar levels by controlling diet is very good. I have been able to control mine for a number of years, my A1C is 5.3, and excellent value. My doctor got this book after I explained the ideas contained and he agrees with the plan Dr. Bernstein promotes here."
2,The cord is long enough.It keep the water warm enough but not hot.If they redesign the design to an modern style it would be better.
2,"I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... ""Overkill"" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as ""Metropolis"", ""Stay Clean"" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of ""Overkill"" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover ""Louie Louie"" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice."
1,"The previews of this movie were the best things about it! The female lead's obviously surgically altered lips were distracting and the idea of people slamming into buildings and sliding through broken glass uninjured was laughable. The transformers were awesome but how long can you watch those scenes before enough is enough. So bad,so disappointing so save your money!"
2,"Since, I left the caribbean I have being looking for real West Indians recipes and this book did the trick . I have being trying to find a authentic recipe for Roti and this book gave me that recipes and many more. Excellent book."
2,"I have this album on CD and vinyl. It's a must-have for your Bonzo Dog Band/Neil Innes collection. All the CDs I have bought from Amazon have been in near pristine condition, if you choose the one with a good description of its condition. Those are Neil Innes' mother's Irish wolfhounds on the album cover. The American version of this album is ""I'm the Urban Spaceman."""
1,"First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash...."
1,"I purchased this amp based on the great customer reviews. It is the most frustrating piece of musical equipment I have ever worked with. I do alot of recording and it's impossible due to the fact that the amp does not turn on until there is a signal sent to it, therefore you never hear the first few beats of a song when you press play. It sucks. What a waste of $100. I guess I should have splurged on a higher quality amp."
2,I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it's difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. We used them over the holiday and they were a great hit.
2,"All history is subjective, of course, but here you get to see what historians are up against when they try to reconcile dozens of conflicting views to try and tell a story. Wisely the authors don't try to tell the story of Saturday Night Live - they let the participants' words speak for themselves, so you hear from those who loved it, those who hated it, and those who, as time has passed, see it with more objective eyes. I would have liked to have heard from some of the missing names: Charles Rocket, Eddie Murphy, etc., but I can only assume they chose not to participate. (The authors don't explain why they aren't represented, or what their interview methods were. I would like to have seen comment on both.) All in all, though, it's an excellent overview of the show's history in the words of those who were there."
2,"I purchased a Canon camera a couple of years ago and a Canon battery came with it. I bought a couple of generic brand batteries to use as backup. After a very short time, the generic brand batteries would only keep a charge for about ten minutes or less. Having learned my lesson, I purchased this additional Canon NB-5L battery for my backup. It holds a long charge and is very reliable. Don't waste your money on generic brands like I did, buy the name brand."
2,I would definately recommend this product to anyone with a Tivo set who wants to use their broadband instead of a phone line to update Tivo. It was very easy to install. Took me about 10 minutes and I was up and running. I've had it for a couple of months now and never had any problems. It always stays connected.
1,"This remake supposedly is based on ""The Haunting of Hill House"" by Shirley Jackson, but there is actually very little of her original novel in this version. In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it's an insult to say it's based on her work.The first film from the 1960's is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it's so scary.In this new ""version,"" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh! And the way it ends is just totally not right! Read the book! See the first version on film! Avoid this new one like the plague.(It's telling -- as of the today, the DVD of the remake is selling for less than the DVD of the first film!)"
2,"The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it was okay. But the more I listened, the more I appreciated it. I burned a bunch of my CD's onto my computer at work and included this CD in the mix. I've noticed that whenever one of these songs comes up in the playlist I always notice it. Clay's voice stands out and I think it will stand the test of time. I can't wait until his next CD!"
1,I hardly used them and they come apart at the seams and the gravel comes out. A waste of money. After using them maybe ten times I have to throw them away.I wish I had read all the reviews here of people that had exactly the same experience as I did! Hardly used and they already fall apart! Sometimes they already leak sand when they arrive!
1,"yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that ""tub thumping"" is okay, even if it ""gets old after awhile"". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel."
2,"I used to raise/sell Golden Retriever puppies, and this book I gave to my new owners for their own good. It's an easy read,and easy to understand. Margery West leaves out all the fluff, and gets to the meat of what you need to do, and what NOT to do to raise the model dog."
1,"We sent this unit out for testing at a leading test lab and they found that it would only be able to clean a very small closet - that is if you are looking to remove airborne particles like dust, smoke or pollen. It could help somewhat with odors due to the ionization process but that is very difficult to measure.I found more specific testing information at the [...]"
1,"Almond sings off-key, but that is a longstanding trademark , and, oddly, creates a weird appeal regarding his singing style. The songs however are a combination of irritating and boring, with the notable exception of his duet with Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. Their mutual effort is a winner and, if unavailable on other discs, makes this disc worth having."
2,"was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
2,I'm glad that L. J. Smith finally put a witch book in her series. I love vampires but it wouldn't really be good if that's all she wrote about in the Night World series. Now she needs to put in a shapeshifter novel and she'll be on a roll. The only thing I don't get about the book is why Thea got expelled with Blaise when she didn't do anything. I hope she became a famous vet.
2,"I love pampers...I have tried almost all the other diapers out there including huggies, luvs, and white cloud. Pampers are the only true leak-proof diapers made!! They also fit my 11 lb. son perfectly. I have no complaints."
2,"A well researched book, with loads of background about daily life of both the peasants and the nobility, this book was a fascinating read from beginning to end. The story line draws you in and makes you believe it could have happened this way, and brings an ancient time to life. I loved it!"
1,"Too bad this book wasn't included among Montag's targets during his career as a ""fireman."" He sure would have done us all a big favor by sparing us the agony of trying to trudge through this trash. Life is too short ... don't waste one minute with this no-brainer!"
1,I tried to give Kerouac a chance to revive himself after reading his most notable mess 'On the Road.' Now I'm thoroughly confused as to why he's so popular.
2,"With all the news of cloning humans lately, this book is timely, if not prescient. Jack Polidoro's scientific background and his expertise in reproductive biology show in this novel. His love of baseball is also evident. Jack has a writing style that keeps you turning the pages and will make the plot come alive."
2,"Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!"
1,"Having first viewed the TV version of this story, I find that the written version tends to be overlong and overdetailed. (I am not that interested in the brand of cigars that old Jolyon smokes.) I am only about 1 1/2 chapters into the book and hope it gets livlier soon."
2,"I am a HUGE Clay Aiken fan and I am excited to tell all the people around the world that Measure Of A Man by Clay Aiken is an AMAZING CD! MOAM is the ONLY cd where I liked EACH and EVERY song on the CD. Clay Aiken is THE role model 4 all children, teens and young adults out there, I know that he's my role model! :) Buy Clay Aiken's cd!!!!!!!!! This CD is TRULY worth listening to!!!!! I can't wait until Clay comes out with another CD. His voice is amazingly powerful and sounds great! My favourite songs are Measure Of A Man and The Way. All of Clay's songs speaks to you in a different way, and this CD gives personal inspiration to everybody out there. This CD reminds everybody of why they wanted him to win American Idol! But, true role models don't need a title in order to be the best! :) Bye Clay Aiken's Measure Of A Man! It will be the best CD you will ever have! :)"
1,"It is my invariably correct opinion that the so-called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed, with EXTREME prejudice, for crimes against humanity and the English language."
2,This cd is an eclectic mix of all different types of songs. One of the most original albums I've listened to.
2,"In November 1820 the Nantucket whaleship Essex was attacked by an angry spermwhale, 1,500 miles off the coast of Peru. This is the true story that inspired Melville to write Moby Dick. After the Essex sank, the 20 crew members took to the open seas of the central Pacific in three whale boats. In the Heart of the Sea is a historian's account of the Nantucket whaling industry, the personalities of individuals, the destruction of the Essex and the three-month open-boat journey plagued by thirst, hunger, cannibalism, and bad management decisions. The book reads as smoothly as any novel yet is backed up by the authority of years of research by a historian specializing in Nanctucket Island (off the Cape Cod peninsula in Massachusetts)."
2,"this cd mixes it up! hard, soft, exciting, mellowing, Blink 182 takes it all, rolls it up into a Cd, put it on the market, and it becomes a complete can of whoopa**!"
1,I am a dermatology practitioner and my own kids have sensitive or eczema prone skin- usually use sensitive pampers but out of stock-this diaper made my 12 month old break out within a day of using.
1,"Painful to watch. Hopefully, this will be the last Transformers feature, with future funding going towards far more worthwhile projects."
1,"I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars."
1,"I guess I downloaded this book by mistake. I got to chapter 6 and that's as far as I could take the unbelievable story. I could see nothing funny and I have a great sence of humor. I gave it a 1 star because there is nothing lower. Sorry, wish I could return the book, but it's been too long, just got around to reading it."
1,"I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better. I suggest to read this book if you feel like you have time. If your into all that science fiction stuff then you would probably enjoy this book much more than i ever will in two lifetimes. Goodluck, you might need it!"
1,"This is a collection of some computer geek's wet dreams. The stories aren't even stories, they're just sex scenes. They are extremely bizarre and took a lot of imagination to create, I'll give it that. But the only person I think who would really enjoy this book is the comic book guy from The Simpsons. If you want a real story with some steamy scenes wrapped in, try Laurell K. Hamilton."
2,"This was an incredible show. Ulrich Roth, Michael and Rudolf Schenker as well as Mattias Jabs kicked butt. No doubt about it. Klaus was great too. My PAL formatted DVD played well. It skipped very quickly about 4 times but it didn't interfere with the entertainment value. Whoever cut this show up though, did a very poor job. Too many 3 second close ups and then going from scene to scene. Too many crowdshots also. All these great guitarists and their solos were so poorly put together by the producers. Bad job. I still have to give it a 5 star because of the songs and energy. It's worth the [...]."
1,My son would love this toy if it stayed together. All the parts come off. It is constantly falling a apart and that is not because of rough play. We have even hot glued it together which works for awhile.
2,"I bought this book last year, and have used it over and over. I am not the most enthusiastic chef, but this book helps a lot. Dishes are not overly complicated, or time consuming, yet are healthy and filling. Most importantly, they are almost all delicious. My husband is thrilled that I bought this book, for now he gets to eat well prepared meals often, and lose weight to boot."
2,I originally saw this movie on TV back in the late 1970s. I like the cinematography and of course the acting is superb. However I think the beginning and intermission could have cut out where all you get is about 10-15 minutes of orchestra music with a still picture of Ireland's countryside. Especially at the end of disc 1 where the music goes non-stop and then you realized that the movie continues on disc 2.
1,"I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer."
1,"This 2nd one is definetly not as good as the first one. I'm big into movies and always buy blu-ray, especially when it comes to animated stuff. Younger kids might like it just as much, but I didn't at all. I was kind of lost in the beginning trying to remember where the last one left off, so it would be a wise decision to watch the first one right before watching the second one. Wish they would have made it more exciting and better overall."
2,"This book is amazing. Its year-by-year descriptions are historical and often suspensful. I remember the first time I read this book, before I knew the outcome of many of the years' awards; each year was a new drama with Mr. Wiley and company setting up the atmosphere of the race. Now, fifteen years later, I own the latest edition of Inside Oscar. It is a constant source of amusement and information. The writing is skillful and clever, and the categorical listing at the back is an invaluable reference. Every year during Oscar season, I will pick up an article by some journalist whose grasp of Oscar history is minimal, and I wonder why they don't just look up who REALLY won in Inside Oscar. I know Mr. Wiley is no longer with us, but I hope Mr. Bona and company continue the great work for future editions. I know I'd love to be a contributor to this tremendous work."
2,"I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. I was bound and determined to do a VBAC with my second, but didn't want to redo the hospital birth classes. Got these DVDs, watched them once with my husband and several times on my own. Extremely educational, entertaining and helpful. Had a successful, drug-free VBAC and used much of the advice and information DVDs while laboring."
2,"We love our smoker and we love the smoker chips/bisquettes! The Bradley Cherry Bisquettes add a great flavor to Chicken, pork and beef! They are cheaper on Amazon than at Bass Pro or Cabelas."
1,I ordered a BELKIN and received an AMIGO.Not what I ordered and when I complained...I was sent ANOTHER AMIGO.Get a clue. Don't shop Amazon!
1,"Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there."
2,"""Of Mice And Men"" is a terrific book! Especially at the end when Lennie gets shot. I just love the foreshadowing, for example, when Lennie kills the mouse, then the puppy, it leads you to beleive that he could maybe kill another thing, and then Curley's wife walks in. I also love the awkward pair,Lennie, the slow, large man, and George, the smarter, smaller guy. Altogether, I enjoyed reading this book and I will probably read it again! I give it four stars because I just couldn't put it down!"
1,"Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no ""grab"" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, ""I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.""Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel"
1,"There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
1,"The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
1,"Like the other reviewer, I began trying to make this thing work in December, for my grandmother. Since then it's been one run-around after another. The first had a broken screen; it took them weeks to send me a new one, then when I got that one and sent it to my grandmother, it didn't work. She spent all these hours on the phone with them trying to get it to work, and it wouldn't, so finally she sent it back to me. I tried to get a refund, and the Mailstation people wouldn't give it to me, because I was past the 30 day purchase limit. Terrible."
1,"I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me."
2,"It doesn't appear as though there are any scratches to the CD that I can tell. However, when I opened the case, I did notice that someone had thumbed it up quite a bit. There were fingerprints all over the top of the CD. But the bottom looks to be alright. I'm taking it to a friend in a shop downtown next time I go to put the CD through their buffer machine just incase, but really I think it's fine. :)The movie came in it's original casing. I'm pretty excited to own it!"
1,"This product came with a disclaimer that it contained substances known by the state of California to cause cancer . This disclaimer was not mentioned in the description, or I would not have purchased it. This is one of the drawbacks of buying online, a way of buying that I generally enjoy and approve of."
1,"I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."
2,"I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times."
2,"I have converted to Judaism in order to have a single faith marriage. Though this books additudes were a bit outdated towards interfaith relationships and does not recognize the wide spread intermarriage phenomenom, the author has a good handle on the issues affecting the Jewish identity. It is a very conservative approach to raising your child with a Jewish Identity, with a focus on early religious/cultural training."
2,"Haven't read all of it, but it is pretty interesting so far. Don't spend more than 5 bucks."
1,"Just FYI....the element heats up fine, but does not seem to connect to my mug/cup to heat the liquid contents. I use it at work to keep my cup of tea warm. A previous one I had (not same manufacturer) died on me and figured a cup/mug warmer most are all alike. I bought the one with the best responses, go figure. This one barely keeps the contents warm, heat is barely recognizable. Sorry does not work well for me."
1,"As stated in the subject line, this product may be a good fitness ball but not firm enough to be a chair."
2,This is a great video for children to learn the stories of the bible at a level the can relate to and in a way they can enjoy. I feel the spanish transaltions are great and accurate. My son even at 8 months enjoys it and is learning not only spanish but the word of God!!
2,"These ""reviews"" have turned into a Clay/Ruben forum..I don't think that should be allowed here. I love Clay and always will. Ruben did win the competition and that's that..Clay has a great future ahead of him.Sally"
1,"The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered ""dangerous"" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."
2,"Classic 3-disk Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian:I can only comment that the disk came 2-3 days after my order, so it was really delivered fast.Due to the combination of many situations over the past month we have been unable to watch the film, outtakes, etc. I'm sure the quality will be excellent, and I look forward to a breathing spell to watch it all."
1,This is an abriged edition (although it says unabriged in the product description) and the print is VERY small.
2,"The soundtrack for ""Kate and Leopold"" is an excellent one, and the beautiful and dreamy musical segments evoke warm and happy memories of the delightful film and the scenes which are represented by the music.I am very happy to have bought this CD."
1,"Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend"
1,The size ordered were what she normally wears--but were smaller than comparable clothes of the same type. Very disappointing.
2,"Still Listening to this CD nearly 2 years later. Great, memorable tunes that are standing up to the test of time for me. I'd say, with out a doubt, that if you're a rock fan who likes great melodies, this CD is a definitive must-buy for your collection if you don't have it already...as a matter of fact, even if you have it already, buy it again!!! It's that good. :)"
1,"Wow, this album is a HUGE disappointment.#1 This does not sound like the same Clay that we fell in love with on American Idol, He sounds like a half rate Boy George.#2 The production is awful, it sounds as if he is being backed by karaoke tracks.#3 Where is the soaring, clear and beautiful voice we know he once had?Shame on those who were in charge of letting this cd be released in this condition.It seems as if all the hype is put into the show, then all care is forgotten when it the time comes to record an album. Welcome to the real world Clay, I hope the next album supports your wonderful talent."
1,"I was surprised to find that none of the films have English Subtitles or closed captioning, even though when I look at single DVD's of the individual movies, they do have closed captioning. Useless to me."
2,If you liked Vanessa's first cd this will definitelynot dissapoint. There is absolutely nothing to beupset as a fan about. She stays along the same linesas the first one with San Francisco being as catchy ifnot more catchy than A Thousand Miles. If you take thesix best songs off the first and the six best off thiscd you have one heckuva cd. Would love to see hertake a chance of the next one and write a song pastthe formula 3-4 minutes. Her piano playing andorchestration would be incredible if allowed to be morethan just fill-ins for a standard pop song.
2,"I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
2,"I ordered this book for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet. It has the Shakespeare version on one side and the plain English translation on the other. It really helped some of my lower level students get involved in learning the play instead of getting discourage because they didn't understand the language. I highly recommend this product, especially for struggling readers."
1,"that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend."
2,"My ex bought these for me for $70 to get me into hiking here in the Cascades around Seattle (I have always hiked wearing regular shoes, but on flatter terrain in Northern California). I have always worn them with hiking socks and liners and they have been phenomenal. I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down. After two years I can still slosh through creeks and melting snow and I've never gotten wet feet. The boots have held up well and look as though they'll last another year or two of hiking and snowshoeing."
2,"Huff has found a catchy title to lure readers into the dry-sounding but utterly fascinating world of statistics.Packed with examples from the 1950s which seem as fresh as yesterday, this book shows how advertisers and others try to trick us by misusing statistics. ""Figures don't lie, but liars figure."" could be the unwritten motto of this book. Almost every day I see a Gee Whiz graph which makes something look like it's skyrocketing out of control before I check the scale. Then it turns out that a 5% or 10% bump looks like 600% to 1,000%. The trick is to abuse the visual impact of the graph.A company might cut wages 30%, then later increase them 30% and claim that they have restored the cut. Huff explains why this is actually a 9% pay cut! This is one of many weapons in the statisticulator's arsenal.Huff, aided by Geis's amusing and revealing illustrations, teaches us how to defend ourselves from statistical abuse, by showing us how the tricks are done."
1,"The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style."
2,The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring is a very fun and anticipated RPG video game. When I am bored I always play this great game. I can never get tired of a good GameBoy Advance fantasy RPG video game.
2,"The finale of the Icerigger series does not have quite the adventure of the other two and harbors a pretty silly villain and plot. None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran. There is definitely something wonderful and personal about this series. The characters are very rich and you really want to know more about them and share in their adventures."
2,"I bought this book from Amazon sight unseen because my 4 year old is now a big sister. I was very pleasantly surprised with the clever design, humor, and fun colorful illustrations drawn by 'Dilly'. It is really aimed at older children (maybe 7-11), especially the humor which is right on for that age. It is great for younger kids too if you don't mind your 4 year picking up expressions like 'gross me out' and 'punky' (which are now common expressions in our house). My daughter is an early reader and this book motivates her to read independently or at least pore over the pictures a lot. I look forward to the sequel re. Dilly's camping experiences."
2,"Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, ""Jean de Florette"", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!"
2,"I purchased this for my husband to load a recertification course on and study. He also has music on it and is enjoying it very much. It was a great price, especially for this much memory. And Amazon's service was great as usual."
1,"When you buy this book (10th edition), do not buy the one with the CD-ROM. It is not the right one (it is the 9th). All the books with CD-ROM have the wrong one. The correct one comes out in October. So if you want to buy this book do NOT take the one with the CR-ROM, because you're going to waste money!!"
2,I bought this book to compliment my Taber's Medical Dictionary. I'm glad that I did. I found that some of the diseases in Taber's were vague and when I looked them up in Mosby's I found easy to understand definitions with lots of pictures of diseases.
1,"This film tried to capitalized on the previously successful Legend of Boggy Creek, and failed horribly. It's nothing but a boring home movie. Other than a shot of someone prancing around a forest in a gorilla suit, the film has no perks whatsoever. Strongly not recommended."
1,"This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to. Bottom line (as always) ***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR***"
1,"its not that bad, but it is just nbot chrono trigger and it doesnt keep the feel of the chrono trigger music. BEWARE of this cd, i only ordered it because I though it was th OSV, WHICH IT IS NOT."
2,"Pampers Baby Dry are the best diapers hands down!! I have raised three 'lil ones, with my oldest I shopped around and bought the sale diapers and off-brands .. boy that was a mistake! I only trust Pampers with their delicate skin and big stinky loads :)"
1,"what the hell is it with americans? why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song on this and that's the anthemic live forever, which is about the closest they got to a decent tune. every other song is idiotic, bash you over the head with a repeated riff rock that shouldn't ever be compared to the beatles EVER. the gallagher brothers are crap, in their attitude, their look and their songs. this is crappp. morning glory is a good album i admit, and that will be the only reason people care about them,,,,accept and move on"
1,"I bought this in hopes to reduce some small bumps on my cheeks and even out my skin tone. What I got was horrible acne and sores all over my face. The very next morning after using it I woke up with zits on my face! I haven't had acne since I was a teenager. My first thought was, it must be cleaning out the pores, thus the breakout, but after three weeks of using it every other day, my face is covered in sores that won't heal! I don't want to say it's a bad product, because it obviously works for most of the people that have written reviews, but my experience has not been good. I will never use it again. I'm just glad I got it on sale for $45. C'est la vie."
2,This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline.
2,this is a old movie that shows how they did it years ago you can get lost in it and enjoy it verry funny a must see
2,"The shoe rack is good. It looks nice and easy to assemble. It is also easy to adjust according to the shoe sizes.I have couple of concerns. One - As other people have mentioned, it is not very easy to put on the big shoes. It is very comfortable to put in my kids and my wife shoes. However, when I hang my shoes, I have literally squeeze them in. Second - When you put all the shoes, you will see the back of the shoes for the ones hanging on the front. The pictures never show the tree with all the shoes filled in, so I never realized that it does not look as beautiful as shown in the pictures."
1,"I order alot of merchandise from Amazon. But will have real reservations about doing so again. This product I did not realize was not from Amazon and so difficult to return I said lesson learned and kept it. But I will think long and hard about using Amazon again. This product was marked with a sticker that said $0.75 I was charged $3 something and then $3 something for delivery and that was suppose to be free. So I paid $7 dollars for a $.075 book. Not happy next Christmas I will just hit the stores and remember this expierence. Before I told friends Amozon is great so guick and easy , now I say watch out what you are getting some things are a real rip off."
2,"This is a great movie and worth any price however, I was at a Best Buy store recently and paid $5.99 plus tax. (BTY: it was not on sale but instead the everyday low price.)"
1,I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.
2,I thought it was great...I actually liked every song track on it....What a great person & a wonderful voice...Looking forward to his next Cd....Finally a Cd where I can understand the words & one that I can listen to around anyone!!RLK
1,"Cassie is so bad, she has to resort to stripping down to her panties in her video clip to get music sales. You all know that she has definately got no talent at all, and you only like her for her looks. She is just a ashanti, but with even less talent. hahaha. Her voice sounds like she was raised from the dead, because her voice sounds lazy and her song is quite boring. She has got no vocal talent."
2,This box set is a must for people that love Toby Keith's old school music.It's got his first three albums.This is back when Toby Keith had some REALLY good songs out.I'm not much into his newer stuff at all.It sounds nothing like this.Buy this if you're a fan of his earlier music like I am.
1,"I often listen to the radio and don't know what songs are called so I could download em. I saw an advertisement for this product, and decided to try it out. Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks. For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up. I deleted them, but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker. I was very dissapointed in this product, espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it."
1,THE worst adiuo and bad story line. What'a waste of my hard worth cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Way too heavy to carry when full, Water doesn't shoot very far and you have to pump it."
1,"Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
1,"Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
1,"This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story."
2,"I love this series, at first it took a while to comprehend the plot but after buying season 1 and then 2, I really started to like this. It is good science fiction at the core.I hope that this series can go on for a many long seasons. I rated it at five. The only complaint I have is that there are not enough episodes per season."
1,"The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers."
1,"Backgammon Attache 18""Backgammon set arrived today. First inspection disappointing. It is poorly constructed, as follows: stitching is inconsistent; points are not sewed down; some side seams ""show air""; board border seams uneven as if not properly glued. The pieces are lightweight, not a good feel. Overall it's seems cheap. Not going to hold up. Does not have the tactile feel of a good procuct. Tactile feel is very important to me. I am disapppointed that the manufacturer did not have a sense of ethics for creating a good product, and that this piece of junk even passed inspection. It may be an acceptable board for a child learning to play, with the caveat that it will not hold up. I now start all over searching the internet for a well made board."
1,"I am Asian, cook rice every day. I am very picky on the rice cooker that I use. I had thought that Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy would give me the best cooked rice. However, I am very dispointed. First, this rice cooker takes forever to cook. I mean twice longer than a regular simple rice cooker. Why? Because it requires 120V while we all use 110V. I dont know why the manufactur does that since it sells to U.S. Second, the texture of the rice that it cooks tastes as good as a $30.00 rice cooker. Third, the cooker use battery. Battery will die. I regret I spent $150 on this rice cooker. I should have bought the most basic one, the one that causes about $90.00. The store doesnt' let me exchange either since I already used it. Well, I just have to live with it."
1,"I was expecting a more scholarly work based solely on the jacket design. Very nice design. I should have looked at the bibliography instead. I recommend you pick up a copy of ""Horton Hears a Who"", by Dr. Seuss instead."
2,"I, too, purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter. I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price. If you plan to leave this player stationary (on a desk, etc.), I think you will be more then pleased. Also, it's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player. The price is VERY reasonable, and the unit is straightforward and easy to use."
2,There is enough product on the mini pads to go over your entire face and neck. The fragrence of step 1 smells good.Overall this product does work. It definately clears up your face. I didn't use this product everyday since I wasn't sure if this was a product that contained 100% natural ingredients.
2,"""delirium"" is nothing less than a work of creative genius, and i personally would be reluctant to criticize it for being 'self indulgent' when reading it is the linguistic equivalent of dropping acid or shooting up. it is that intense. after you finish it you immediately want another book by reed, or at least i certainly did. the source of poetry is free subjectivity and imagination, and there are parts in this book that are truly transcendent poetically. reed is interested in rimbaud when he was the 'god of adolescence', the period in his life of total rebellion and artistic frenzy. he does a near flawless job of showing that while verlaine and his somewhat cruel and hateful companion may have had a physical and shallow emotional bond, rimbaud was far above him on the spiritual and intellectual plane. this is a necessity for any admirer of rimbaud and surrealism."
1,"At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300."
1,"Worst novel I've read in a long time, and I'm tolerant on sci-fi. No wonder it was rejected for years by editors and then, oh dear, downloaded by people by who have not read much when the author self-published it.This book is a piece of cr*p, with characters who mostly hate one another, and then most of them die. Much of story is these idiots who hang around a building, yelling at one another, then die. So you get to know a few characters, and then they're dead in a few pages.Gawd. There was not one single character I liked. I actually hoped they would all get keeled and recuse me from this poor excuse of a story."
2,"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories is a short but delightful book written by the world famous veterinarian. It is beautifully illustrated by Lesley Holmes.This book consists of ten stories from Herriot's previous books that feature dogs that he has treated over the years. It's difficult to pick a favorite as they all have amazing personalities. There is Brandy, who is such a scrounger that he gets his tongue stuck in tin cans that he digs out of the trash can. TrickiWoo, a Pekingese, picks winning horses at the races. And Gyp, an epileptic sheepdog, only barked once in his entire life. Although all the dogs have special characteristics, it is obvious that it would take a veterinarian with compassion and humor to see that these animals are more than just pets.I truly enjoyed Favorite Dogs Stories. However, if you've already read Herriot's other books (which I haven't), you will find that they're repeats."
1,"A few helpful hints among 160 pages of wasted space. Not a solution in the book. Nice pictures, but not practical for the family looking for storage and orgainzation ideas. Even the choice of font and layout make this one difficult to read. If you are looking for a practical home orgainization book (I was looking for a home office organization book), skip this one."
1,"I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."
2,This is an excellent read if you haven't already played the games. It's a great compliment to the Halo Game Series in that it provides more detail than what is presented in the games. This had a few spelling mistakes and mis-print/duplicate pages here and there.
2,"fantastic investigative reporting with compelling analysis. as easy to read as a good spy thriller and as informative as a good textbook. valuable reading for anyone interested in Japanese finance and the relationship between bureaucrats, politicians, and business.read the first chapter on amazon.com and you'll be hooked."
1,"I've used Pampers Cruisers and Pull-ups and both work great...but these Baby Dry Pampers are awful. They leak probably once a day. I've never had this experience before with other diapers which hold the wetness much better. I will be shopping for a different kind. This is ridiculous, no way should they leak as much as they do...very frustrating."
1,"I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time."
2,"To begin with, I LOVE this cd; however, when I purchased 'Toxicity' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey! and (the song) Toxicicity. That was not the case. Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy (at first) as the songs getting radio play.With that said, this is an incredible cd! It'll definitely be on your list of cd's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing. This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day. There's some serious intensity on this disc that I can't describe in words. I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks (Prison, Chop Suey!, & Bounce).If you're looking for somthing heavy, pick this up. But just know that it's not all ""Chop Suey!"" and ""Aerials""."
1,It may work for some but not for me. I used this product for about 8 weeks with no results.
2,"I liked this book , the story was interesting and it showed different sides of American culture from the eyes of an immigrant farm worker."
2,"100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel."
2,"My 4 yr old is really into hunting so this is perfect for him right now. Yeah, it's more plastic that will eventually break and the binoculars arent anything great but he doesnt know that. I think it will get lots of use especially from his own imagination. Cant beat that!"
2,"assasins really does develop the tarl cabot character. i felt that it was a timley installment in the gor series. as usual, norman dives into the natural male/female dominance/submission theme, but i like his opinion."
2,My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn't have worked. I figured the next best idea (and actually cheaper idea) was to get a DVD we could both watch. Sheri Bayle's attempt at humor is not as good as she would probably have hoped but she is still an informative and relaxing teacher. I would recommend this DVD if you can't attend a class or if you just need to save a little money for all the stuff you will need to buy your new baby!
1,I have just about every workout there is and like a challenge. The only workout I got with this video is from pushing the fast forward button because she puts a 2 to 3 minute break between every set. There are 3 workouts and each workout is only about 8 minutes if you leave out the breaks. PLEASE do not waste your money Please. I am sending this back. I have never ever done such a bad workout. It is really ridiculous that this ever got released.
2,"The DVD's were in great condition. The DVD box was a little beaten up around the edges and there was a little folder in the front of the DVD case that was empty so it looks like something that came with the DVD was missing, but overall the product was great. It's going to make a wonderful nostalgic gift :)"
1,"And I am a recovering Catholic now Episcopalian! Also,a registered Democrat with moderate to liberal views!Part of the argument we on the religous ""left"" as it were have with those on the far religous ""right"" is that they seem to want everything clearly outlined and defined. Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election. The stuff on St. malachy's predictions was interesting too althought probably a fraud."
2,"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"
2,"After listening to Mary's first release, Blue Skies Over Dundalk, I thought it couldn't get any better than that. Well, Mary has proven me wrong. Roulette Girl is a half hour of deeply emotional yet still witty songs. Anyone with a pulse should own this album."
2,"Clay has one of the best voices I have ever heard. He puts emotion and thought into every song on this CD. Every song is exceptional and different in it's own way. You could listen to this CD non-stop for hours and never tire of it... Here's to Clay's long, prosperous career, ..."
1,"I have a 1.7gig P4 running XP and found this product to be very unstable which is a nice way to say it doesn't work. The hardware would always hang my computer no matter which software I used with it. Also a note to their clueless tech support, my Maxtor hard drive was the cause for the sound and video being out of sync, when I reinstalled XP using a Western Digital drive the sync problem went away but not the instability. Believe Microsoft when they say use of an unsigned driver may make your system unstable."
1,"bought this book eagerly because I'm a Civil War reenactor and love the period. This book is a major disappointment. The hero and heroine don't get together until the last third of the book. The war is little more than a backdrop ""Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing"" over and over. Instead of real romance, we get child molestation, slave concubinage, the obligatory PC horrors of slavery....gag. I wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver. The author also made a few mistakes with her research and does a poor job of depicting historical figures such as General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and others. She tries to describe the heroine looking sexy in pantalets (which were out of style by the time of the war) and a camisole (which is an undergarment that didn't exist yet - women of the period wore chemises). If you want to read real Civil War romance written by somebody who really knows the period, buy Heather Graham instead."
1,"I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."
2,"I have alot of interest in the books 1984, and Burgess's 1985 who also wrote Clockwork Orange. This book was hard to read and really didnt make alot of sense most of the time. Is more Science Fiction than anything else-not a view of the future. The main character is found to have a ""soul"" which of course makes him mentally ill. Has alot of History to it but not much relevance. But Im certainly not the best one to review this book. I enjoyed 1984 very much."
2,"In all of television history, I can't think of a better love story than that of Angel and Buffy, the mismatched lovers on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" It has passion, sex, violence, all the angst of youth tormented by parents and a world that contrives to keep them apart. The episode ""Angel"" introduces us to that romance and it's a great way for newcomers to the series to catch up. ""The Puppet Show"" is creepy but also a real riot. The strength of ""Buffy"" has always been its knack for portraying high school as a horror movie. Sure, vampires are scary. But so are high school principals with Napoleon complexes. I only hope the WB releases more episodes on videotape."
2,"I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
1,"I got this for my 5 year old. I loved the concept, unfortunatley I never seen such a flimsy toy. We had to super glue everything together because pieces would fall off, this is because there are no snaps to keep levels in place but rather just fits together. Would not buy this toy!!!!!!!!!!! Would not recommend this toy unless your willing to super glue all parts!"
1,I bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine. The problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months. Will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair.
1,ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
1,"The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
1,"This a a huge waste of money. I am so disappointed in Mr. Coffee, I've liked their other products but this does NOT keep your cup of coffee even lukewarm."
2,"I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year."
2,"Fine item, does what it needs to, the wires are small but works just fine. If you need a long cable like I did for a chase pipe run, then it works."
1,I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
2,"There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well."
2,"This is too much like ""The Matrix"". For the first half hour, it was making me mad. All the same effects and even in same locations. Although some of the good/evil approaches were actually thought provoking, it wasn't really new. Not bad for a filler, but not a main event."
1,"I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."
2,"I almost didn't buy this book because it had Christmas in the title and I supposed it would not have much in the way of the pagan holiday. I was very wrong. This is the best book I have ever read on the solstice. It tells of celebrating Yule before Christianity abducted it. ""The Winter Solstice"" has the look of an arty, coffee table book but it is definitely worth the read. It offers a couple of small rituals and some great phrases for ceremonies. It is more of a scholary history than a magickal book. I cannot wait to read it again next December to get me in the Yule spirit!"
2,The book was a little slow being delivered but no problems! It also came in better condition than I was expecting! (:
2,I thought it was a great book. It's filled with a lot of very useful information and it's always great to get info direct from casting directors since they are the ones who we all need to audition for!
2,Works fine. Easy to install. Some reviews talk about not fitting wall plates. Designed for the plate supplied to fit over the existing plate so plate supplied is over sized for a reason.
2,"There are groups that rock and then there are groups that really rock. Little Charlie and the Nightcats do the latter. This ablum is a must buy. Take it to a friend's party and plug it in his/her CD player and watch the place start to jump. This one is definitely a keeper and there is not one clunker in the whole playlist. There are three must play songs on the album. These are That's Big, Coastin' Hank and Go On If You're Goin' I recommend that you check out the rest of their albums if you want to hear more of their stuff."
2,"This book is a great introduction to a fantastic author that is often overlooked by American readers. ""Zorba"" is fascinating, deep, and hilarious, all at once, and it's short and playful enough such that it won't turn off more casual readers. I recommend this title as a starting point for people who want to read Nikos Kazantzakis for his philosophical insights or for his moving stories."
1,"I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket."
1,The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend.
2,"Twisted view of a future world, even more creepy looking at it from a time 20 years after this imaginary future... it is interesting to compare and contrast this book with reality..."
1,"this movie was just plain bad. bad story. bad ""gore"". bad everything. don't waste your money or your time watching this."
2,This movie is a Classic! So Glad to have found it:) They just don't make movies like this any more.
1,"Got her fast, but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back. There should be a note on how to order Converse. One size smaller than your original foot size. Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big."
1,"There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon"
2,"Well, when you hear of an Adam Sandler movie, a natural reaction is that you think that the movie is a hilarious comedy, but in this case, that's not entirely true. Don't get me wrong, the movie is FUNNY, persay, but I don't think I would catagorize it as a true comedy.If you're looking for an Adam Sandler type comedy, I'd rather recommend There's Something About Mary, which is a comedy with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz, than this movie.But don't get me wrong, this is a good MOVIE, but not a good comedy. Rob Schnieder's role is just plain dumb, but Drew Barrymore is what truly makes the movie worthy of watching. She did an excellent job. You have to be a die-hard Adam Sandler fan for you to appreciate his performance in this movie. If you are watching this movie for Adam Sandler, then this is a pure waste of your time, but if you're watching this movie for Drew Barrymore, it's well worth it!"
2,"The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch."
1,"This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. I like some Live music but this is not what I wanted. Order a different one."
1,"I've lost all faith in reviews. I'm one of the most generous star-givers out there, and I could not find anything good about this movie. I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars. Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music. I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper."
1,"Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon."
1,I owned many models of Mail Station & loved them from the years 1999-2006 but since then there are no ISP servicers for this gadget. It used to be owned by Earthlink whom was then bought out by Cidco and now there isn't anyone providing service to send/receive emails with this thing which is too bad since it was easy & fun and a way to communicate without the internet without spam or any advertizing. Whenever mailstation has a new provider ( doubtful ) I will purchase another 1 year contract as my gadget still functions it's just that I cannot connect without an ISP. Everyone whom owns this thing knows what I speak of; it's obsolete so why buy one ? ( If you read the disclaimer below it states they won't supply service to new customers ; so what is the point in buying this ? )
1,"I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors..."
2,"This is an example of absolute perfect filmaking. If you read the book, you will know what I mean. It is probably the most true-to-the-original screenplay ever written.Slowly building on on how the everyday things we hear and see can turn into our worst fears, this film spells horror in it's most realistic form ....plain old paranoia. Or is it?""This is no dream; this is really happening!""Watch it over and over again for the view of NYC mid-sixties ... the bright cheerful whites and yellows everywhere... Christmas in the city ... and wow, can they be creepy!Amazing."
2,"This is such a grim, frightening and scary book by George Orwell. Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for ""thought crimes."" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, ""I love you"" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim. However, still a good book.*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
2,"I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla."
1,"Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked."
1,"This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."
2,"Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition."
2,I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font. Publishers-- someone work with the author to get a shiny new updated version please!
1,"Printer worked well for about 2 months with light duty printing. Now get constant ""Out of Paper"" errors even though the papertray is full. I've done everything suggested-cleaning roller, etc. After cleaning roller the printer will feed paper for about 5 sheets and then fail again. HP support site says contact them for free cleaning kit. When I contacted then on Online Help site, after a bit of useless troubleshooting, I was told that the printer was out of warranty and cleaning kit would cost $39. I estimate that I printed less than 100 pages of text with this pinter. Since I screwed up and bought extra print cartridges, my cost per page is probably around $2 per sheet. If you own this printer and are planning on upgrading to Vista-beware. There is a good chance the HP Solution Center will have problems."
2,My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. She has enjoyed reading it through out X-mas vacation. I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift.
1,I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole.
1,.....I own a VHS tape of this movie and the sound is about what you would expect from a 1947 Western but the quality of sound on this DVD transfer by Synergy Ent was poor to the point of being distracting ...in several scenes the sound was almost unintelligible ........In addition the DVD has no special features and just goes right into the movie as if it were a VHS tape ...if you must own a DVD of this movie I would suggest that you shop around for a better vendor.
2,"We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son's second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home. He would wake up in the morning and beg, ""Elmo Firetruck House?"" He learned all about firefighters and firetrucks. We bought him a firetruck and hat for his birthday and he plays with them while watching this dvd. The firefighters in the video are actual firefighters, and they did a great job of teaching what to do in a fire. We all love this one!"
2,"I'm a Brazilian train fan and I bought this DVD because Amazon said it was closed captioned... but not. No english subtitles for my better understanding and international customers.Positives: Image quality (DVD), DVD structure, good value.Negatives: No subtitles and too much narration... sometimes unnecessary.Obs.: A blue-ray version would be nice... with subtitles, of course!"
1,The copy recieved was not as described. I was expecting a clean used copy and I recieved a copy that was used as a text book and had yellow & green highlighter and hand written notes in the margins. I could not give it as a gift.
2,I love this cd very much it a wonderful collection. It I think a better collection then the other one because it doesn't have all of the english songs to see every time we look at a Selena cd. So because of that I think it wonder. The spanish song are the same way it got the songs that we don't see. I think this is a great collection because this is the true meaning of selena.
2,"""An Irish Christmas"" is Moya's 6th album and was released last year in the UK. This CD is a beautiful listening experience for Christmas in Moya's signature sound. Many will know Moya as the first lady of Celtic music, the voice of Clannad and older sister to Enya. ""An Irish Christmas"" is a collection of Christmas carols celebrating Moya's beliefs in the Nativity. The good thing about this CD is that there are two songs added that where not included on the UK release but the bad thing is Moya's two original songs from the UK release where not included on this CD. My favorite song from this CD is ""Carol Of The Bells"" which is perfect for Moya's haunting vocal style. Her song ""Oiche Chin"" Galic for ""Silent Night"" is sure to be a hit as her two children sing with her on it. This CD brought a touch of Ireland to my home last year with the UK release and I am sure will this year with this release."
2,"In this book, Thomas Hardy manages to cut deep into the human soul, and uncover to us a part of our makeup that though inacceptable in some cases, yet, very real. He talks of man's selfishness and desires. He presents his theory, which states that man's destiny is no more than the product of his character and fate. In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom. (check the death scene, page 123; it might be as well, the most elegant description of a human being passing away!)"
1,"I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!"
2,"Very simply, with few words, this book explains that there is a beginning and an end. In the middle is life. Beginnings and endings are going on around us all the time. For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point."
1,"Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."
2,I didn't want to risk a generic charger and got the Canon brand at the lowest price at Amazon.
2,This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know where the modern labor laws and labor unions come from. It depicts in stark detail the criminal acts against American working people that do not show up in many textbooks.
2,"This is a highly amusing movie shot and acted superbly. It reminds me of David Cronenberg's work. That and other reasons probably explain this movie's 98 reviews and 46 Likes vs 19 reviews and 5 Likes forMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?(cf my review). It is incredibly satisfying and must have been a lot of fun to make."
2,I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
1,"I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
1,"When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to ""right-sized"" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost."
1,"This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time."
2,This is a wonderful video. Teachings egyptian technique and combos- I love it. It has helped me become a better dancer.
2,"I spent literally years tracking down ""I Should've Known Better,"" the mid-80s Euro-hit, because I had never learned the singer's name. When I finally found the album I bought it just for the song, and was not disappointed. The rest of the album is good, but I Should've Known Better is one of the best pop songs ever recorded."
1,"I do not have this edition. I got from another publisher. Anyway, I will comment on the content. Really fragmented information. Gives only description of cards. The meaning is still very very vague. Any other tarot book will excel this."
1,"This book is a classic but suffers from any of the problems of antiquated sci fi. It is not character driven, but is more about the authors neat fictional idea and the character is more of an after thought."
2,"this movie was for both men and women. the shots in the movie were very well done, the music was cool and it is one I would be pleased to own. It had a style that made sex very sexy and not dirty."
2,"I've always had trouble reading but when I read this book for my English 2 class I loved it. It was a very good book. My fav line is... ""Ask not for sucurity, there never was such an animal, and if there was it would be related to the sloth which spends its time hangin upside down in a tree""""To hell with that, I say, kick the tree and knock the sloth on his @$$!"" Must READ! I wrote an essay on this book and got an A!"
2,"Seven words: ""I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.""Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly ""Push It"" and ""Special"", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: ""Temptation Waits"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Medication"", and ""You Look So Fine.""Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."
2,"I got this book for free as a limited-time offer for Kindle, so I might be a little biased. That being said, I still think it's worth either buying or renting from the library. What's unique about it is that it is largely told from the first-person perspective of Lewis, an American college student studying at Oxford University in the UK. Lewis, following after his friend Simon, enters into the world of Albion which is styled after Celtic history and mythology. Many people are opposed to the book because of its Christian themes but I would say give it try anyway. It's a refreshing and unique take on historical fantasy."
1,"If you want to play chess, go grab a real chess board.1. The two player mode isn't really two players. You have to share the same controller. Yes, you literally have to pass the controller back and forth for every move.2. No one plays this game on Xbox Live."
1,"With the cost of these bulbs I was expecting a WOW when I turned them on, but only got a very slight improvement from the previous bulbs. Maybe it's because their in an old Dodge Intrepid which are know to have poor light design. But I was really hoping for an improvement. I run them on high beam all the time just to be able to see at night, and no one has ever flash their lights at me."
1,"Well for starters monique's stand up always involve male bashing because by the looks of her I can understand and the other comedians were garbage as well (except for paul mooney). This was by far the sorriest shaquille o'neal comedy video in his production, I definitely do not think this video was funny."
1,"the movie was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks"
1,"I bought these little rubber mallets for my glockenspeil, it was a bad idea. The sound is muted and they do not work, stick with conventional plastic or wood."
1,"this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
2,"Peter Turchin's ""Quantitative Analysis of Movement"" is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns. Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques. Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared. Turchin is kind enough to provide a special appendix, ""Diffusion for Ecologists,"" for those with relatively weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself). Not easy to understand but well worth the effort."
2,"I have not read the book as of yet, but just wanted to let people know how substantial this book really is. It is about the size and weight of a large dictionary. While not the best for portability, it is definitely a keepsake or collector type of book. It even has it's own ribbon style bookmark built in. Can't wait to read it."
2,"I love this product and my 3 yr old has enjoyed playing with it. However, the case is difficult to open, even for me! my daughter will get frustrated and pass over this toy because of that."
2,Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!
1,I wish this was broken into sections like the copy I borrowed from the library. It's kind of overwhelming the way it is printed without any breaks.
2,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
2,"This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital."
1,"I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
1,"Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype."
2,"Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her track leads her to the Uffizi museum in Florence. There however, Anna is struck by the Stendhal Syndrome, which makes her faint, when among certain works of art, like paintings and statues. Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario.........."
2,"Thanks to this book, I am now an amateur astronomer. I have a lot of astronomy resources but this is the one I use over and over again.This book is designed for someone without any experience and is an excellent guide for showing someone where to look. Within just a little while the reader will be looking at galaxies, nebulas, and globular clusters...Bob Flater"
2,"Love the performance. Love the support. The only problem I have is with the durability. I've owned two. Ok only paid for one, and they were good with the exchange. But for some reason the right ear cup keeps going out about every 3 months with extended use. Don't get me wrong, I'm far from abusive to a 300 dollar piece of equipment. All in all, great if you want a name brand. Just don't expect to not have to use their customer service."
1,"When i bought this game, I thought Wow! I get to play Lord of the Rings! After a week I was bored with it. THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE!!!!!!!!! The combat is very slow and tedious, and the game freezes up to much. Do not under any circumstances buy this game. I gave it one star because it is Lord of the Rings."
1,"I was really excited about the product after I read some reviews. When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual. I am still using the product even I know my skin is the same. No more velvet skin or nothing. I do have Keratosis, I bought this product believing in the reviews that I got from people with the same skin condition than mine. I used on my face also to try to take off some dark spot from sun, it didn't work yet.So I don't like this product because did not do anything for me. I feel I thrown money away."
2,"Live in New Mexico and have a summer mountain cabin at 8500 ft in Cloudcroft--brrr. Usually 15-20 at night in January. No other heat source. Got the new Dyna-Glo 23,000 BTU Portable Kerosene Convection Heater up there yesterday at 130 PM and it was 30F in the cabin. it has a 400 sq ft main room and a 280 sq ft upper sleeping quarters. Temp went up to 40 in 1 hr; 50 in 2hrs; and it was 65 in 4 hrs. It was 72 degrees at bedtime, 1030PM, and I filled the tank and went upstairs where it was 58 degrees. Put a CO monitor at the stairwell to go off so I wouldnt die of CO poisoning in my sleep. It never went off. By morning, it was 61 upstairs, and 80 in the main room. The full tank had gone down by just over 1/2 by 7AM. No stink at all and I am sensitive to that. Had to shut it off to cool it down in there for morning coffee! The low outdoor temp only got to 28F, so not sure how it would do in lower temps....will update if/when we try it. GOOD heater, albeit a little slow to get there."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
2,"I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is ""When I Grow Up."" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."
1,"First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this movie is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph! Plus the dvd features are limited and there is NO ""Making of..."" feature, only a theatrical trailer and some production notes (too short). Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD."
2,"I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled ""Deep C Secrets"" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level."
2,"You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a movie or tv show or commercial that you like? Well, take all of those and put them in one movie and this is what Run Lola Run is - and they made it almost 10 years ago! If you haven't seen this, treat yourself and get it."
2,This was an amazing collection of British films. They were all very well acted and played out. I prefer British film over Hollywood because the actors in British cinema are REAL people. There isn't all that Hollywood glamour!.All in all well played.
1,"This has got to be one of the loopiest films I've ever seen. Does it work? Not really. Is it fun to watch? With these women, how could it not be? But don't expect logic in any way, shape or form. (Keeping track of who is or isn't a lesbian alone could make your head spin.) Unfortunately, don't expect good songs, either. Why make a musical with such paltry material? I guess the director's answer would be ""why not"" -- which is pretty much the feel (and philosophy) for this entire film."
2,"Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action. It is not an ordinary scary movie or thriller - definitely, it is more... Try it and I think you won't be disappointed at all."
2,"I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
1,"Wow, truly how many plot lines can you put into a single movie? We start with the creation of the 4th Reich by escaping SS troops and scientists. Then we get zombie super troopers, forced abortion as a cure, a nazi spaceship, robo-hitler, etc... Don't pay more than $5 for this movie, that includes shipping. It had a few funny moments, but not many. The special effects weren't too bad, at least it wasn't a rocket on a string with a fire cracker in the tail. The actors were mostly supporting actors tossed into leading roles, or more like co-leading roles."
2,"This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun."
1,"A question, why would Engelbert sing old songs, when the are so many new ones are written? Why would he sing Beatles song and destroy it. A man with such a great voice, sings songs that don't match his personality. Please make your next CD more original. Thank You. Your fan."
2,"It works like a charm. Well, it won't work over the more secure WPA encryption, but it works great with standard encryption.My complaint: It's clunky. On a computer desktop, it's alright to have something that needs to sit on the desk and connect to the PC with a USB cord. My TiVo, however sits stacked between my DVD player and my XBox. The USB WiFi adapter is forced to perch precariously on the back of the shelf. It'd be better if it was designed to just fit right into the USB port, like the one I bought for my girlfriend's computer (which cost $10 less).The TiVo is supposed to work with other brands of wireless network adapters, but I figured the safe choice was to buy the TiVo brand. Overall, I'm not disappointed."
2,"Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel books exist for the country? Because it's quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. In Living Abroad In France, author Terry Link begins with the dream and offers a step-by-step progression to achieving its reality, with chapters surveying all aspects of living in France. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted."
1,"well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
2,I enjoyed this dvd it was amazing to watch I would recommand this dvd to any and all WWE fans.
1,"I detested this book. I felt the actual story never quite matched up with its admittedly interesting premise. The character of Patty Bergen seemed feeble and weakly developed, and I never understood the inexplicable hatred the entire world, excluding Anton and Ruth, seemed to have for this girl.The whole ""love story"" plot was laughably unrealistic, due mainly to the age difference. The most frustrating thing about this book is that it could have been so much better. The whole irony of a Nazi and a Jew falling in love during World War II has so many options for a good plotline, but instead the story seemed to spend a good majority of the book wallowing in self-pity."
2,This toy is amazing! It guesses what you're thinking every time! I think this is a fun toy for people of all ages! I love it!
2,This book provides an another resource in addition to the PCI Express Specification. This is helpful since I'm at a small company where no one else is working on PCI Express at the moment. The book is well written and well organized. It is useful to me as a system architect as well as the other guys in my group who will be the designers on our next ASIC project.
1,"This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
2,This is a very fascinating book that lets you see inside the minds of five unique characters (plus Swan herself). It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring! The characters are written with excellent detail and realism and the story has lots of twists and turns. Impossible to put down!
2,"Lingle has again written a book far more valuable than its price.For those interested in Asia,and the econo-politics of the region, this is a must for any library, private or public. It is easily readable even for those not initiated in the arcane language of economics. His initial beliefs were manifested in the last year and a half."
1,"I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it."
2,"I just finished reading When ALl Hell Breaks Loose, and I must say I was deeply impressed with the writing and creativity displayed by Ms. Spencer. Her characters were exciting and three dimensional and her words seemed to leap off the page and electrify my mind! I particularly loved her male character Greg, and the fact that she wrote so well from a male perspective. I predict great things are on the horizon for you, sister Camika, and I am happily spreading the word about your talent and strong literary voice. You were wonderful to indulge us with a few paragraphs in Philly, and I look forward to reading CUBICLES. Peace and blessings!"
1,"I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
1,"As a math major, I am of course interested in the subject of Real Analysis. But I cannot agree with the other reviews in that the book is very UNACCESSIBLE to undergraduates! I have poured through the first 3 chapters until I almost have them memorized and the concepts are NOT CLEAR. Instead of explaining what is going on, the author rambles on about the ""beauty"" of his subject and how ""we"" as students should ""carefully"" digest the ideas. The examples and proofs are NOT clear and are NOTHING like the HW problems! In fact the proofs are so incomplete, that proving them in the fashion that the author does, does not convince my professor??? This book is a BIG waste of over $100 and a class that I might have enjoyed if the author could see outside of his ego and stop trying to show off to undergraduates who do not know the subject yet!"
1,"While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children."
1,"I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product..."
1,"I buy Amazon Prime products quickly because I trust the service to offer really good prices. I admit I did not notice that this bottle had only 2oz in its description. I just looked at the price, which was just like the price of a standard 4oz bottle and clicked Buy. I was really surprised when this tiny bottle arrived. Mea culpa I guess. So the bottom-line is: always watch for the downsized products even on Amazon.com!"
1,I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement.
1,"My shirts arrived today.Thin, ...an understatement!I've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said. These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing. You know, like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies, selling off their name. I wouldn't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS! Back they go! I'll suffer the shipping."
1,I bought this for my brother who is an architect. I thought the picture was really cute. I was really disappointed with this when I got it. It's made of hard plastic and there is a weight inside that bangs around when you move it. Completely not what I expected.
2,Dr. Lewis Sperry Chafer was used by the Lord as a champion of grace. And I have no doubt that this continues even today....long after Dr. Chafer has gone to be with the Lord. I recommend this book both to unbeliever and believer alike. I have never read a more comprehensive book explaining the marvelous salvation that God offers the whole world through simple faith in Jesus Christ!!!
1,"A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."
1,"I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
2,I've seen several of these books and I think this is the best of the lot. I was very impressed with the total vision of the book.
1,"I just purchased the SRF-M75PM and have had the same problem as everyone else with the belt clip coming off. I was jogging and the clip separated and the Walkman hit the pavement!As far as the unit as a radio is is awesome. Especially with the mega bass and pulse monitor.So if you run or jog, don't buy this unit.I called Sony and they have no fix for the problem. This Walkman is going back to the store."
2,"The BD version takes the SD version to a whole new level! The colors are brighter, the clarity even better and the audio is fantastic - just as you would expect with a great movie in a full HD format. The only flaw is that this disk starts up rrrreeeeaaallllyyyy slow - so slow that I was all ready to send it back to Amazon for a replacement when I tossed it into our player (Samsung BD-P1400, firmware dated 09/08) one last time and then got distracted by a phone call; when I returned, the movie was up and running like normal. Our family estimates that it takes about 3 minutes to bring up the main menu... Outside of this flaw, everything else is great."
1,"I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress."
2,"I am pleased with my Umbra tension rod. I needed a rod with no hardware, because my new house has concrete block walls and deep window wells. This tension rod fits the bill and is a very attractive too."
2,"We first checked this book out at the library. My child, 2 at the time, giggle and laughed, especially when the dog licks the boy's hand. We had to buy our own copy. I later used this book with a neighbor boy who was terrified of dogs. It showed him that the little boy in the book gave the dog a chance and so should he. It helped a bit. The writing in the book is easy to follow, on a child's level and the pictures are darling. Highly recommend this book!"
2,"I'm not much of a ""hard rock"" fan. I enjoy it from time to time, but I mainly listen to Radiohead, older hip-hop, etc. But this album got me hooked.One day, many years after the release of Toxicity, I decided to check it out. Right after the first track, ""Prison Song"", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was. Serj Tankian's interesting [but awesome] vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen. Check it out.-Jeff"
1,"After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned."
2,"I really appreciate how Philbrick writes his non-fiction. I have read four of his books now and they read like historical fiction (but they not...). His ""Notes"" chapter is very complete and the bibliography is excellent."
2,"Enjoyable ride through time from modern ages to the far far future of the universe. The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies."
1,This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.
2,"This is seriously the neatest office gadget I have. I have switched from stainless steel coffee mugs to a porcelain mug with a lid because I do not like the taste of my coffee/tea in the stainless mug even though the stainless mug keeps my coffee hot until its gone. The problem with a porcelain mug is that it doesnt keep my drinks hot for long. I can take as long as I want to drink my coffee/tea now, and it is still the perfect sipping temperature even after an hour. I think I may get one for home on my coffee table for when I get discracted with the kids and leave my coffee until it is cold and then have to throw it out."
2,"I am 26 years old and I still remember reading this book as a child. I have always loved castles, so the castle layout diagram at the beginning of the book really made me happy and drew me into the world. The cover is different on my edition, so I hope the diagram is still there in this latest printing. I was an avid reader as a child, and I highly recommend this book!"
2,This is the same as playstation2 verison i love all ov the 2K's this has better graphics then playstation2 but this is a good gane overall.
2,"Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!"
2,"After reading this book and playing with the included practice test you will be in great shape to pass the 70-228 exam. That's assuming you already have a working knowledge of either SQL Server 7.0 or 2000. If you are not a DBA this review will not do the trick.One other note, while the practice test does not include many questions they will prepare you well for the exam. I found them as helpful as any of the more costly test prep products."
2,"We use Subscribe and Save to purchase our baby's diapers. What a great service! The price is very competitive, and usually beats the local store prices (even with coupons). We use the Pampers brand because they absorb well -our baby is a heavy wetter. We also collect the Pampers Gifts to Grow points and redeem them when we have enough."
1,"Boring, dragged out, thought it would never end! This movie is terrible!!!!! NOT fun like the other Batman movies!!!!!"
1,"Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
1,"I used this product for less than an hour a day, and the band broke within two weeks."
2,"I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. It was not cartoonish like the previous series of Batman movies had become. After the first batman with Jack Nicholson, it was all downhill for Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie."
1,I found that story line too predictable. I felt that the author made the female characters in the novel nothing but ...air heads. She made no effort to prove that a woman does not need a man to complete her as a person. I am just very disappointed that a sistah feels so lowly of her own kind.
1,"Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title."
1,"I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft."
2,"Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to ""all the Photos"" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."
2,"I was completely lost in this book, the storytelling was captivating! A wonderfully written book that made me want to read Chronicles in the bible! Excellent!!And so now I find I NEED to get the next in the series... I can't handle knowing there is more and not reading them! Good job on marketing - give me the first one free, sell the other four! :) But, if all four of the next as as good as the first - it'll be money well spent."
2,"This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
1,"My HONORS 9th grade English teacher made us read this incredibly boring story. Here's a hint, when you make a book called ""Summer of my german soldier"" INCLUDE THE DAMN GERMAN SOLDIER. I'm telling you read something better like ""When Zachery Beaver came to town"" way better. This book is pointless and boring. undefined characters, pointless details, FICTIONAL information on WWII."
2,A great read for any Minnesota sports fan. Extremely interesting approach with a number of authors giving a lot of local information about small town teams and how black baseball players were accepted...or not accepted...in rural Minnesota. I found the articles dealing with the small towns much more interesting than the big city articles. I remember watching one of the games many years ago and found some new information that I did not know.
1,"NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****"
2,"I liked it overall - always great Mikasa quality, just wanted to warn others, that advertised ""crisp white background"" came in rather milky-creamy-off-white color. Definitely not white."
1,"Poor production from the early-mid 80's cannot be corrected with a ""remaster"" attempt. I purchased it directly from the company a few months back. With the greatest respect for the lady giving the sewing instruction who can be your best friend's mom up the street, the production values are so low and filming techniques so outdated as to be useless to observe. They make use of a mirror on her work surface, a camera does not go right into her work much of the time and contrasts are low. Editing was also very choppy at times. The resolution is so poor that I could not see critical details. It just isn't easy to see what she is doing half of the time.Good solid information is given for beginners but I cannot recommend this product. Not good value for the price. I honestly believe the company should scrap it (and the series assuming the rest are like this) and start over."
1,"It does keep the mug warm. The coffee? That's a different story. My old warmer died after years of service. Apparently the lawyers became involved in the years between purchases. This warmer doesn't do the job but it probably won't generate any accidental burn lawsuits.""I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me."" -Banksy, street artist."
2,"After reading the novel of Mice and Men, i gave the book four stars because it is a very interesting. This book always kept me entertained. In my opnion the whole book was the climax because therof the novel. George and Lennie are two great characters that protrayed a great friendship. Although Lennie was slow, you got a sense of how protective George was of him. There jounray across the country to find there dreams by getting a house together, thought would have come true but was tragically ended."
2,I really enjoyed this book. I'm always interested in learning about the Holy Spirit and this book was somewhat of an eye opener. I would definitely recommend it.
1,"I really wanted to like this CD - and I even bought it at retail to support Dez - but...it's rather unlistenable. Flat. Unmemorable. Rote. Why not just finally release his amazing MODERNAIRE track from Purple Rain? After hearing that song back in '84, I waited patiently for the Dez solo CD...and waited and waited and waited...this ain't it."
1,"This is a perfectly sized steamer for a pound of shrimp or veggies. The quality is good as well. I really thought I had a winner with this steamer. However, the steamer basket did not fit well into the lower pot--seemed too big and sat up on an angle on one side. You'd think quality control at the manufacturer would catch something like that. I promptly returned it for a refund."
2,"Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"
2,I have four children and this is the only diapers that did not leak or cause my child to break out in a rash. I believe it is best for the skin if you can do cloth but if you are using diapers this is the one to pick! I only buy pampers baby dry (the other pampers cause my babies to have rashes). These diapers will hold all the pee and runny poo=) The price on subsribe and save is great and with no tax or shipping how could you go wrong?!
1,"This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!"
1,"Yes, I fell for the marketing. I saw it spotlighted during the Christmas season and I thought why not. Well before you make the same mistake let me tell you how incredibly annoying this toy is. It is loud, frustrating and has no obvious on/off switch. Therefore my kids refuse to have it in their rooms because it will unexpectatedly go off in the middle of the night. It will play your ipod or simaler mp3 player but it adds so much noise that it really isn't worth it. It does not dance like it was advertised to do. In fact it will hardly stay in the position that it is pictured in. I will say that this was a complete waste of money and is about to be donated."
1,"After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!"
2,This book should be required reading in all schools. Not onlyas a tribtute to his remarkable efforts but to further the moral and social education of all races.
1,"This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blas film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying ""who cares?"" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."
1,"The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!It"
1,"While I expected the CD to occasionally skip, I was disappointed in how low the volume was.I had a Sony Discman and the volume was low on that, but with this player it's ridiculous."
2,Lewis explores the human psyche in this literary masterpiece. You will go away with insights that you might not have considered before after reading this wonderful book!
2,"the 400 blows,hiroshima mon amour & l'annee dernier a marienbad,pickpocket and a bout de souffle (breathless)are, somehow, a new way to look at things and how to express it to anybody else, on a screen. the edition and the shooting of this film is one of the countless virtues it conceals. belmondo & seberg actuations are superb, as well. they create a couple and their story -it is a film noir indeed- is being told in a completely different way. he's a thief who meets seberg, and a crazy and naf love affair begins. he, a modern tough but tender guy, wants to find his way out of his enviroment by mockering every law, while she reveals as a chic, short-haired femme fatale who'll carry everything to tragedy and betrayal. the final shot is pure poetry. this movie changed everything and it still remains inimitated, even for godard himself. breathtaking music. script by franois truffaut."
2,This movie is better than I thought .... It's more Kung-fu comedy than anything. Usualy the charactor Wong Fei-Hung is a bit to serious and stiff. To see him in a comedic setting is quite refreshing and him dressed in a chicken suit fighting the centipede was hilarious. I enjoyed it so much that it's now a part of my Jet Li movie collection. The man is a versatile actor and very good martial artist.
1,"I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
2,"I was a little concerned about buying this item by the Internet, but everything was really easy and the service was perfect. The items arrived in very good conditions and on time. Wonderful service!"
2,I still can't believe that this is a used book. I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O
1,THIS WASTE OF TIME COST ME TWENTY BUCKS FOR A VIDEO THAT WAS NOT EVEN THIRTY MINUTES!! YOU CAN NOT EXPLORE ANYTHING IN THAT SHORT OF TIME!!!! YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON YOUTUBE FOR FREE!!! DON'T FALL FOR THE SAME TRICK I DID! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,"I like these diapers, they're easy to put on a squirming baby. I like that the swaddlers have a wet indicator, but those aren't available for Amazon Prime, so I went with these. No real complaints, I can usually tell when my baby needs a change without a wet indicator."
1,ok clay has a good vocie but come on hes ugly in the songs are the same'ol pop songs just think of him as another ruben good vocie but to ugly but one thing ruben can sing better in is a real singer with good song but clay sucks big time he wont be big so trust me on this one i know music in i know when i say this cd ant worth it dont buy it ant worth the money theres not even one good song on this cd this whole cd sucks so DONT BUY IT
1,"i got a pair for my daughter. however, when she tried it on, we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight. though it fits her, it was not comfortable. she ended up not wearing it at all."
2,"I loved this book in high school, and I love it now. A tale of a strong woman that doesn't let society bring her down."
1,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the ""New Testament"" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the ""guilty until proven innocent"" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."
1,"I read the reviews before purchasing this adapter, and I guess I simply got a dud. That happens, but the tech support is horrible. The support staff was very unhelpful and told me it would take weeks to replace.The other adapter replacements don't seem much better, given the poor reviews for Kensington's model.Just hope you don't get a dud."
1,"This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read."
1,I was enjoying this series until the HORRIBLE Bollywood episode when the solution to the issue of a huge Abnormal who could move sections of the earth was a Bollywood-style dance. That ended it for me.
1,I ordered this DVD since I loved the Trinity movies. The picture was horrible. It was as if Fellini was on acid. The dubbing was terrible and the story was uniteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,"We were very excited to give the Titan Tower to our son for Christmas...and are now very disappointed. This toy is of very poor quality. The pieces will not stay together and my son has no interest in it, saying it is not fun because it keeps falling down. I wish I had kept the receipt so that I could return it."
1,"Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
1,"I was expecting a lot more humor. Actually, the last 5 minutes is the funniest and only made me grin."
2,"This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the ""family"" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."
2,"I collect Jim Shore cats, and I have to say that this one is just amazing. The colors are so beautiful. The figurine is also quite large. Such a great purchase! Buy it, you won't regret it!!!"
2,"I had been buying Huggies diapers until I ordered size 3, which when opened were the same as size 2. I switched to Pampers and the sizing has been consistant.They are also a better fit for a chubby baby and do not leak."
2,"I loved this book so much that I read it straight through! And then I read the rest of them in succession. Austin is a great author, bringing the Biblical characters alive in a way I'd never imagined. This book series will expand your understanding of this Old Testament story of Hezekiah, and it is fascinating!"
2,"This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss."
2,This beautifully illustrated children's book introduces some simple but important ideas. It's not about the family that a child will one day have; it is about the one from which the child comes. Children don't pick their families; they have to make the best of what they've got.Youngsters from non-normative families may see themselves for the first time in this book. Youngsters with friends from non-normative families may even learn a little sensitivity.
2,I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx.
2,"This is a highly entertaining show that you can watch over and over again. It deserves an Amazon.com double five star rating, it is that good. Think, if you will, of the Velvet One's rising to the top in spite of her talented and tabloid catching siblings and in spite of the emergence of girl groups who are flooding the airwaves and CD displays with soundalike claptrap which has only a catchy phrase or a man-slam to its merit. (Pay some dues, girls.) Look at the Velvet One's performance in the concert showstoppers--""Alright/I Get Lonely/Rope Burn"" ""Black Cat"" ""What About That"" ""Rhythm Nation""--I mean...is she great or what? And look at how many of the Velvet One's tunes you know by heart. There ain't that many performers out there of Janet's calibre at all these days...well, maybe a few of 'em. They seem to be calling themselves ""diva"". Oh well. Thanks, Velvet One, from saving us from an entertainment void."
1,"The 1 star is for the DVD not the film. Roger Rabbit is EXCELLENT, but the DVD is very poor. The menu is borning and rushed, the conversion from video to DVD is not amazing and you can see a lot of grains of dust on the film which cause the blobs you associate with old movies...The sound is excellent and colour too. No extras, no trailer, no good as a DVD. I would wait for Disney to make a 'Collector's Edition' which to you and I is what we expect of an normal DVD. 5/5 for the film, 1/5 for the DVD!"
1,In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.
2,let me start by saying i am a massive fan so my thoughts are one sided okbut if you can lay your hands on this cd do it stand out tracks wellthey all stand out but instant funk crying bunny sigler by the way you dance & of course inner life aint no mountain high enough & sparkle handsome manif you are serious about quality dance music it doesnt get much better than this collectionits not easy or cheap to find but get it & play it for someone not aware of this music i assure you they will find something in this to move them its worked for me
2,"Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved. He has expressed a preference for 'The Autumn of the Patriarch'. But for the rest of us '100 Years' opens up worlds, opens up minds and opens up literature. If you haven't read it you are missing a dazzling milestone in 20th Century literature."
2,those damn bastards that rated this cd 2 should be burned. they dont know what they are talking about.....sdre is the best band ive heard. well ive only heard about them a few months ago but i love their songs a(space)lot
2,"This book is for older women who need to ""find themselves"" all over again and use as a tool to journal thier thoughts. As a woman in her 20's I still found it to be most helpfull in conjunction with my regualar Franklyn and Palm pilot as a way to organize my thoughts and goals through journal writting. It's a great gift for a woman of any age!"
1,"Wow! It's like they transplanted someone from Kansas to the epitone of hip cities. There is no sweat, no sips on a hurricane. There is no funk! This is not a city that can be described from the passerby. You might know the names, know the places, but you ain't experienced a thang. You gotta step on a Coke cap and do a little soft shoe. You gotta bar hop, swipe your brow with a hanky in a smoky club where the jazz is the only thing hotter than the weather. You gotta suck a neck of a crawldaddy, eat rice and beans on laundry day. This is a city of great storytellers, and this ain't one of them!"
2,"Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy. Almost four decades of the drug war have produced no discernable reduction in drug use, but loads of folks in prison and a steady erosion of our constitutional rights."
1,"I purchased this item last year and have used it about 5 times. While steaming some tamales last night, not only did the pot turn my oven covers completely black (currently soaking in baking soda and vinegar) but upon further review the bottom lip of the pot is completely separated from the remainder of the pot. What the heck? I am going to throw this in the dumpster now. Unless you guys will refund me. * After posting this I got a positive email from the company. Thank you guys"
1,Just got mine today and found out that BOTH sequels are rated R and NOT unrated as the packaging says it is!
2,"Ecological understanding is a must for all generations. For those with the courage to think through the implications of an ecological world view and want to learn the scientific concepts which help facilitate greater understanding of natural systems, leading to (hopefully) better decisions regarding resource use, this is a great book. By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet. Rigorous and enchanting cognitive medicine for all those working to make a better world."
2,"Defintley Maybe is not like any rock album I've ever heard. Liam's vocals are the kind that linger in your head for a long time. ""Rock N' Roll Star"" and ""Married With Children"" are the best songs on it if you ask me. ""Supersonic"" is also a good song. Defintley maybe sounds like someone took the talent of Jimmy Page, Elton John, The Beatles, mixed it all together in a big pot, then molded it into a CD. Yes, this CD is THAT good."
2,"The story is an ode to optimism, in spite of all. Is everything that happens in this world for the best? This is the main philosophical question addressed in this book, and Candide will try to prove you that."
2,"Really like using landscape plastic versus the landscape fabric sold in home improvement stores. The plastic does a much better job of killing the weeds below while preventing new weeds- the fabric sold in stores is more expensive and the root system of weeds actually thrive along the material. 4MIL black plastic is my favorite to use with stones especially. Product well priced, good quality, great shipping and made in the USA."
2,"This thing arrived five days before the original estimated delivery date and even one day before the Fed-Ex date. Rolled nicely in the box without folds or crunching that would cause roll marks in the nap. Fits great on the dash in my 96 Camaro. The only thing to mention would be that where the dash drops to the right of the instrument panel the binding sticks out slightly further than anywhere else. Could only be on my particular piece, as I do not know if they are bound individually or machine run. Overall a great buy and worth every penny. I purchased this because my main dash plastic has several cracks and the dash mat was less than half the price of a new main dash panel and of course, less work. Best improvement to the car to date!"
1,"No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."
1,"I was expecting this movie to be like Eternal Sunshine or Garden State, a youthful drama. The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school. Give me a break. I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view. The movie was not believable and the characters were not developed well at all."
2,This book categorizes many true and false reasons one might find himself unemployed. The book then gives commonsense directions to overcome the perceived inhibition. Great book!
2,"My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. This set of books is unbelieveable in the sense that Schwartz's storytelling knows exactly how to get to you. I'm a senior in college, and yet I still remember quite vividly reading the stories and being afraid to go near the back of our yard because it backed up to a field. In book two (I believe) the story of the thing in the mirror STILL gives me chills at night (my dorm room has a full-length mirror in it, and I hang my robe over it at night!)And, of course, my father knew just what to do to make me really remember the stories...like sneaking up behind me when I was feeding our rabbits at night at the back of the yard (next to the field, of course)I would highly recommend this collection of stories to anyone who is young at heart, or just wants to scare the pants off of their child (or sibling). The memories are well worth the cost of the books!"
2,"This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!"
1,"My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
2,"Despite some less than stellar reviews I bought this book. I got a chapter or so into it and thought it sounded familiar. I had seen the movie. I really liked the book. I liked that it moved slowly. I think if real people faced such a scenario, they would experience the same disconnect: disbelief in the situation and the idea that rescue would come if you just stayed put and waited. Deciding on your own what to do would be a difficult decision, especially in the face of pressure from others.Moody's story slowly built up to the final confrontation. Anticipating some horrible climax is, to me, good horror. Even after having seen the movie, as I read the story I wanted to put it down. I couldn't. I wanted to see what would happen.I'm hooked. I'll read more of his books."
1,These pampers are not good quality as compared to same brand product available on any other retailer store. The problem with these pampers are the poor absorption and also the velcora waist is not good quality. I would not recommend for future buy.
1,This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).
1,"Poor acting, silly plot, and bad writing! The first one was not so bad...went down hill from there. Not worth your time."
1,"Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this."
1,"I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree."
1,Horrible movie. I didn't even finish watching it. It reminded me of a low-budget B-movie and that is being charitable.
1,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
2,"Action, suspense, politics, social commentary, great writing, great characters, great acting- there's nothing to dislike here.Any recounting of the plot would spoil the pleasures of watching it all unfold for the first time. And the pleasures hold up on repeated viweings- I've watched this 4 times in the last year.I highly recommend this DVD- and though I've not seen the truncated and Americanized remake, I know it can't compare to the original. So watch this one!"
2,"The price is right and the holds the bike for repair, cleaning, or just parking. Does not hold the bike very tight but for the novist repairman, it is great."
1,"It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I ""skimmed"" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."
2,"I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
2,"My sister, Joette Zitwer Wolf Alkire read this to me in 1965 and I still remember the vivid descriptions that the author, Jules Verne, was able to impart to the gentle reader."
2,I thought that is book was very good. It was mostly about friendship between two friends name lennie and George. Lennie is the retarded one and George takes care of him. Cause lennie mom and dad die when he was a little boy. They both have a dream to own there own land. There dreams very come true because George shots lennie. If George didn't shot lennie then the police would kill him because he hurt a girl in the weeds. Weeds is the name of the town that they use to live. But they had to move because what lennie had done to the girl. Now they work on the ranch. Lennie can't talk that well but he is strong like a bull. George is the smart one he takes care of lennie. George gets mad lennie cause George buys lennie a puppy but lennie is so strong that when he pets the puppy they puppy dies. At the end of the book George shot lennie for lennie good. There dreams never came true.
2,"Another installment in the Texas Cattleman's Club series - Silhouette Desire #1547 (November 2003) - ""Entangled With A Texan"" by Sara Orwig. Book summary from back cover:Tied up in knots! How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."
1,"This ""Mug Warmer"" did not work very well. The warmer turned on, heating surface got hot, but did not create enough heat to keep my coffee hotter then lukewarm. Additionally, I had to down size from a Mug (Starbucks '92 Chicago Skyline) to a cup (blue) since my favorite mug wouldn't fit on the heating surface.I normally heat my mug in the microwave, fill 3/4 full with tap water, set on high for 2 minutes, 3 in the winter. Then dispense right into the cup from the Keurig which is set to 192 degrees, 10oz of liquid. In this case, I drank half and left the cup on the warmer.Upon my return, 30-40 minutes later, the coffee was not cold but saying it was warm would been an overstatement.I would have expected a little better from a Mr. Coffee branded Coffee ""Mug"" Warmer. On the other hand it was only $9.Get what you pay for, but I returned mine."
1,"I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :("
1,"I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next....."
1,"This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. I got into the second mission and thought, ""Is this it?"" From what I can tell, there is only 5 missions. I couldn't take anymore past the second mission.You can't scroll around like in SimCity, Restaurant Empire, etc. It just very one dimensional. If you are looking for a game that doesn't have all the bells and whistles, then this is the game for you."
2,"Every so often I find a story that is so authentic in the revealing of its characters, that I find myself wondering about them when I'm finished. ""How is Francie?"" I think to myself...""Is Katie happy?"" I wonder...""Does Neely sing just like his father?""...as if they are real, and their lives continued somewhere in the cosmos after I finished the last page. This is one such book. Although I found the everyday drudgery of the Nolans just trying to survive a bit tiring, I would often chastise myself with the thought that ""This is very real for many people, even today..."" The crisis of poverty and hunger remains with us, and I was struck by my own frivolity as I watched the Nolans struggle to save every single penny. I wonder if I had read this book at a younger age, would my lifestyle have been any different? It is well worth the occasional struggle to complete this novel...for I believe it will impact you internally."
1,"After trying to work around the issue for days, I got on line with HP customer support. This printer will not print a pdf from acrobat. If you want the ability to print a PDF, you have to download a third party program (FinePrint) set it as your default ""printer"" to which you ""print"" all your documents, and then print to the printer from FinePrint. As I work in a business in which a LOT of documents are electronic, and in PDF format, the printer is worthless. Even on the HP website, on THIS printer's data page, there is a ""Printable Data Sheet"" in PDF format. Well, on any other printer in the world, it would be ""printable."" Not on this little paperweight."
2,"This program is as wonderful this year as it was the very first year I saw it. I watched it on my Kindle Fire last night and could not get over just how clear the picture was and how crisp the sound was. I enjoyed and appreciated the extra programing after the main show, but the newer shows will never be as good to me as the original! I actually missed the advertiser and advertisements that sponsored the program in the first years ;-)Streaming this from my Kindle to my TV will allow for the rest of the family to watch...and did you ever think, when you watched this for the very first time, that you would watch this on your own personal TV (tablet/android/phone) and then stream it to your big screen TV? I know I never would have dreamed of such a thing!"
2,"I was looking to hook my computer up in our kitchen/dinning room and wanted the option of watching TV when not on the computer. This monitor works perfect. We do not have it hooked up to a HD broadcast, so it looks better from about 4 feet away than right up next to it. But either way it still looks good. I love surfing the internet and watching the basketball game in the PIP. We don't haver it hooked up to a stereo and use the TV speakers and it sounds GREAT! It has a lot of set up options to get the picture looking its best. And the remote has gread functions and is easy to use.The monitor, itself, looks great. We always get great compliments from our friends!"
2,This is the type of pitcher use at the coffee house where I work. It does a good job. Low involvement purchase.
2,"I've been using the foot cream and foot wash for a little more than a year now.I have some foot problems that just won't ever go away, but this helps a lot. It still won't go away, but it's much more manageable than it ever was.Great product and I haven't found anything that's worked better yet."
1,"This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags. Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard. Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of ""The Incredible Journey,"" the one they only have on videotape."
2,"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"
2,"I'd seen all 3 movies prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it. My only commentary is, ""It's Spiderman"". I think that says enough. I'm well pleased with the delivery terms, condition and quality of the products."
1,"I ordered a ProTouch keyboard protector from amazon for a macbook pro. I received a cheap, no name brand clear rubber keyboard cover for a macbook white. it came in a bag that said ""Wireless Accessories"" on it. that's all it said. the same bag that the no name brand cell phone cases come in. certainly not a presentable package. I was displeased to say the least, and no company name was available for me to ship it back to, or exchange."
2,"Although the shoes were exactly what I wanted, I think the price is considerably high for canvas-topped shoes."
1,"This series is my first experience reading Moorcock. I am usually an avid reader, but I kept finding myself making excuses to do anything except get back to this book. The characters lack sympathy and depth. There are plenty of battles, but the plot stringing them together feels stale and sketchy. I'll probably finish the series out of sheer stubbornness, but I wouldn't recommend this book or the series to someone who is not already a fan of the author."
2,"My son loves these kinds of movies. He says it is awesome and said, If you love gore you will love these movies."
1,"I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."
1,"I guess I was like 13 when I first saw this movie. Even then I was smart enough to watch this tanked piece of garbage, and say to myself, ""What the hell is going on here?"" Bob Hoskins was okay, as Mario, but John Lequizzano as Luigi? Tear out my eyes, would you please? I'm so glad this film bombed. It would have been excruciatingly painful to watch a sequel. It was a disaster and it looked nothing like the game."
2,I ordered this book for school and expected to get the book within a few weeks. I received the book less than a week later! The book was in the same condition that was listed. I would recommend this seller to anyone needing textbooks at a good price.
1,I can't rate this item because I have not received it. I have had this problem when I tried to order the toy story pack of one and two.
2,"The music is ok on this, yes her voice isn't what is was in the past but everyone gets older. Still wonderful to hear.I saw Barbra on her first night in Chicago on the 2006 tour and although this fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing her in concert, I was not at all impressed with her choice of Il Divo. They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows, I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for. An entirely different experience and as she will most likely never tour again, there went my one chance to experience Barbra as she should be."
2,"Mary Prankster may offend the meek...but they can go elsewhere, 'cause Mary scores another hit. It's great!"
1,"My GF bought this amp as a present for me, and now she's very unhappy. We opened the shipping box, which was 5 times the size needed, removed the amp and hooked it up. We couldn't get it to do anything advertised! Nothing hooked up to it produced any sound. Only the green ""ON"" light and the red speaker lights worked. I called the 800 number for tech support at the mfgr. of this AudiolessSource Amp 100, and, after the normal recorded voice menu, when transferred, the phone just rang and rang. No support or customer service!! It went back today!!"
2,"really like this item. Very durable and strong. Had other ball before but this one is very nice. Ball does not lose air, is strong and can hold significant weight."
2,Simpletech's 256MB CF is very fast. I use it with my Canon camera and love it. It gives me quick transfer rates with high resolution. Same time and money and any headaches.
2,"I really liked this book because I like animals, and I really do want to be a veteranarian! READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,The seal was broken and some of the product had been used. Because I was afraid to use it I tossed it out.
2,"paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%"
2,"To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the ""later 80's action film ara"" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no ""Condemed"" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars"
1,"There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down. If it's a lightweight drapery panel, you may be in luck. Otherwise, forget about it."
2,I'm not very old ut I think that this is by fare the best book I ever read.
1,"I was expecting the usual prime 2 day delivery when I ordered this package of diapers over a week ago. I guess I have become so spoiled by Amazon's 2 day delivery that I just expected it to be here, and have been anxiously awaiting its arrival everyday until I had to breakdown and go to Target for diapers yesterday to avoid a complete crises....I will read the fine print next time or make sure I am getting the fast delivery schedule that I am expecting"
2,"It's really my pleasure to cook with this rice cooker. I always set the cook time as 6:30AM, the tasty smell just sweetened my dream, I love it.I rank it as the best rice cooker ever in the world, I marketed this product to all my friends, it worth of the money if they knew how beautiful the rice is cooked.I am very critical on food, but this rice cooker just broke me down, I don't have any negative words on it. O...hold on....there IS ONE - the price.I can use it forever, and will buy a bigger one when I got married.Jessica Liu"
1,"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."
2,"I use this ball as a desk chair and it meets my needs perfectly. For some context, I'm 6'1"", 200 lbs, and my desktop is at 30"" with 25"" clearance underneath. I inflated the ball to almost exactly 75 cm without any concerns. The included pump is adequate, but you'll pump for 15 minutes or so. The plastic plugs seal up the ball just fine, and come out easily enough with the help of a pointy object. I haven't had to do this but once initially to adjust the amount of air. It has held the pressure pretty much constant for 5 weeks now. The ball does not pick up lint and dust, so it stays looking clean. I like that it's rated for so much weight--it doesn't feel at all vulnerable to bursting, even when I bounce on it, which is a nearly automatic reaction to sitting on the thing."
2,THIS GROUP HAS EVERYTHING A YOUNG CHRISTIAN NEED AND WANTS. HIP-HOP MUSIC BUT STRESSING THE LORD'S NAME. I RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE GET THIS CD.
1,"Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers. ""plug and play"" install did not work. downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC. attempted to contact vendor,no email was available, only a long distance phone number. Threw it in the trash."
1,I agree with the woman who reviewed this album. It just sounds like Backstreet Boys and Nsync music recreated in 2003. Been there done that. Clay needs to step his game up if he wants to last in the music industry any longer.
2,"Though one reviewer felt the format of this book was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for ""cooked rice"" or ""cooked peas"". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth."
1,"Poorly made, washed out stones. Cannot use for gifts because the quality is so terrible. Would have returned but missed return deadline due to travel. Stuck with them."
1,"I am writing this review based on the words of my 4th grade son. He was really excited to get this book as he thought that it was going to be a great story. His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend."
2,"It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real."
1,the book was easy reading with some interesting facts.But...the recipes were not very palatable. I gave the muffins I baked to the birds because they tasted like bird food and the rest of the dishes I tried to feed to the dog.I do not recommend this book.There are more out there with more information about diabetes and better recipes.
2,"Face it, Annie Trevelyn is a spoiled brat, progessive thinking for her day or is she trying to rebel by being shocking. She is very naive or just ignores her father's knowledge that actress usually end up being kept by some man. He didn't want that for his child.The problem is that she is not a very lovable brat at that. And Colin McBride or ""Laddie"" as Trev knew him wasn't exactly interested in that kind of wife. Colin, at thirty two, should have been a bit smarter than to trust her. And to get into trouble by befriending her actor troup, wow!But let's face it - she is the personification of many of todays kids - I guess there are some in all generations. [grin]I will admit to being supprised at who turned out to be the villian - I never guessedRecommended --M [with questions] but I did love finding out about Kate and Trev's extended family."
1,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
1,who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
2,"Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
2,loved the dvd thanks Amy!! Hoping to be toned and firm by the end of this Summer!! If you enjoy step areobics you will enjoy this DVD check it out!
1,"I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt."
2,"This is a qood quality vest, and it will work for a festival. I would say that it's more costume quality than I expected, and the gold grommets are pretty noticable. The vest doesn't look as much like suede in person. But my husband really likes it, and he will be wearing it."
2,"""Death defying comedy"" best describes this very fine example of Harold Lloyd's genius! Great comedy dialogue and a fantastic story are combined with the wild stunts that are the trademark of this superb comedian."
1,"Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
1,"...except it's not! This film is supposed to be an uplifting comedy, however I found it painfully predictable and a bit sad. Keir Gilchrist was great, playing Craig, a young mental patient who wants to kill himself. Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a ""comedy"" in which no one really says or does anything funny. I was hugely disappointed with it."
2,"i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish."
1,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's horrible. That's a particularly sad thing to say after Heroic Trio is one of the best Hong Kong movies in a long time. I'm not sure if I'm annoyed with Michelle Yoeh's prolonged death or her prolonged presence with nothing to do for the rest of the movie, or the fact that the husband is killed 20 minutes into the movie.It's not just that this is one of the dumber Hong Kong movies I've seen, it's also that it had a potential to be really great. It has great stars, it's a sequel to an amazing movie and it just falls flat. Too many places where nothing's happening, dumb jokes, awful musical montages and the fight scenes don't excite me.Nothing really to recommend in this movie. I suppose if you are a diehard fan of Anita Mui, Michelle Yoeh or Maggie Cheung (whose better in Green Snake) watch it, but be prepared to be disappointed."
1,"Let me give you some advice that will keep you from pulling your hair straight out of your scalp... stay away from this game. Don't take just my word for it... alot of folks here feel the same way. Do not listen to those that tell you that all this game needs is a killer machine to run. Believe me, I have a good machine and the controls are still awful! You get tired of yelling at Lara, telling here to get her butt up them stairs! People around you will think your nuts for screaming at the screen. Laura has never looked better, that is true. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's sure nice to look at, that is for sure. But, even if had a ghost of a chance of making Laura go were you wante her to go, you'd still have to deal with bugs, freezes, Laura walking on air, and attrocious angels. Do yourself a favor... stay away."
1,"Your money would be better spent on a book that teaches you grammar AND vocabulary. This set comes with no directions, just a bunch of CDs in a box. Using the software isnt explained, the games are useless as you can win just by clicking all over, you dont have to learn anything.Learning phrases isnt helpful for any language if you dont know how to take vocabulary and form your own phrases.Honestly this is a waste of cash. Get a book. If you need pronunciation help buy a book with an audio disc included."
1,"The machine was great while it worked. Just after the warranty expired my ""Ionic Breeze"" completely stopped working. For [the price] I expected quality!"
1,"I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either."
1,"I could really use this Item but I won't order it if I cannot order the color that I want; guess I'll have to look elsewhere.....sorry, this company seems to be losing a lot of sales with the 'let us choose for you' policy."
1,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
1,"Please. Save your money and don't buy this or any other book by Gail Howard. The entire premise of number combinations that are more likely to hit is bogus. It sounds good but its not real. Do some research online about statistics and probability. Each remaining ball has the same odds of being drawn. There is no skill to these types of lottery games-unlike say following the remaining scratch ticket prizes available for a certain game online and seeing what is the best buy. She has her success by people randomly winning with her book. Those that win are publicized. Those that don't are quietly forgotten. Seriously, youll win more money by taking the money you would have spent on this book and buying lottery tickets."
2,"This is a fantastic life after death experience written by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it encouraged me tremendously after the recent death of my son, who had also proclaimed his faith in Christ before God took him. I enjoyed the book so much, I read it twice."
1,"I ordered a hardcopy of this book and was sent a paperback. The seller did not even have a hardcopy in stock event though the item description explicitly said that it was a hardcopy. Had to send it back, waiting for refund - this is a hassle and I still don't have what I wanted."
2,this is a must have book for people who are attracted to the moon energyI find the moon spells in this book make magic look easy
1,this game will never earn akklaim ne sort of money except for ppl who like these kind of lame games it really isnt gwd really the cameara angles really bad too the grphix ok but who care bout grphix when u cant even get a good view of ur character nd the surroundings u will get bored of this game fast dont buy dun ever rent it im serious this game is so confusing too when u collect hearts it doesnt even tell u information on how to get the heart except a wierd riddle they give you that doesnt make any sort of sense plus once u manage to get a heart u get too strart over isnt dat fun u loose all ur extra life u earned and all the heart pieces u earned u need 100 to get a heart wow say u got 99 heart pieces then u pik up a heart guess what u get to start all over collecting the heart pieces dont even rent this game this game is so sorry i bought it and it took me forever to trade with my friend for one of his game i had to give him 5 games for 2 games
1,"Fast deleivery as usual from Amazon, but don't waste your money. This coffee warmer doesn't keep coffee more thann lukewarm at best. Spend more on the Norpro and you'll be very satisfied. I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."

2,We really love the Pampers baby dry for our 13 month old. We can't really think of any significant leaks be it during the night( when we don't change his nappies cause it disturbs his sleep)or during the day. Also with Amazon's great prices it is a good buy...
2,"This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the authors experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management."
1,"I purchased this a month ago and found out this was not working correctly.I had it pugged in and it went on by itself, then another time I could not control it with the remote....Not happy in Lynn, Mass"
1,"After picking up this book and trying to follow along, I found that there were several innaccuracies in the steps. Add to that the confusing layout and miniscule screen shots, and using this book became an exercise in frustration. I've just gotten a copy of the Illustrator Bible, which appears to be much better organized, readable, and useful."
2,"8 volumes of christian principles that have guided our lives in today's modern world. You will be amazed with the wealth of information, leadership, guidance that these 8 volumes provide. A must for anyone to read or have as a research source."
2,"Each month I scan the ""new"" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?"
1,"OK I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS BOOK AND I COULD BELIEVE WHAT I WAS READING. I THINK THAT IKE IS TRYING TO MAKE ALL TINA FAN BELIEVE THAT TINAS BOOK IS A LIE IN IT SELF. BUT I DONT THINK SO BECAUSE WHAT REASON WOULD TINA HAVE TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO TO CLOSE THIS REVIEW I WANT TO SAY ""TAKE IT FROM ME THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH 1 RED CENT""."
1,"Although this has a better story than Robocop 2, there still isn't anything special about it. Totally forgettable. Appealing only to 6yr. olds who have real low attention spans. It also lacked violence, the key ingredient from the first two."
2,"I remember seeing the feederz at Ruthies Inn sometime around 1984. The singer walked in with a shaved head, long fur coat and a dog collar, jumped onstage and played an outstanding set. As a 16 year old kid I was in awe of their music. So I would purchase this cd if you want to here some outstanding songs."
1,"This book will tell you that six sigma is an excellent quality improvement program, (You probably heard this already) yet authors won't equip reader with the tools that six sigma offers. I read this book twice with a strong desire to understand the principles of the six sigma, but after reading it cover to cover twice I got nowhere.I like to read, and through the years I read a lot of books, but consider this to be the worst business book I read so far! Jack Welch, in his book Winning (which I strongly recommend) dedicates one short chapter to Six sigma, and it covers everything you will learn from this book. This book offers no substance what's so ever!!"
2,"This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable."
2,For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
2,There should be a warning label cautioning drivers not to listen and drive. You'll get lost in the beat and end up with a ticket! FIVE STARS ISN'T ENOUGH !!
1,"System of a Down's debut album seemed hopeful. An unique sociopolitical hardcore album with a bit of room for improvement. Unfortunatly the improvement never came. The follow up album, Toxicity, contains a few singles and simple filler tracks. The political lyrics suggested by the band title have been toned down (probably to broaden the audience) as well as the rock. Very disappointing."
2,"Clear the Decks!""Salty, irreverent, highly amusing"" -- New York Times""One of the best adventure tales of the war."" -- Time Magazine""A book you don't want to put down once you start reading it."" -- Our Navy""Clear The Decks... has an authentic, briny tang to it. And the climax, the tale of Admiral Gallery's brilliant capture of a German U-Boat, is breath-taking.... Anyone who wants to know the real reason why our Navy wins wars ought to read this book."" -- Herman Wouk""As an action-packed account of a baby flattop's campaign against U-boats in World War II, this is a corker. The author writes with warmth, understanding, clarity and rough humor."" -- St. Louis Post Dispatch""A good deal more than a series of belly-laughs."" -- BOMC News""You do not need to be a lover of the sea to enjoy this splendid and humorous."" -- Columbus Dispatch""A RIP-SNORTING ACCOUNT!"" -- Los Angles Mirror"
2,"The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
1,"This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information."
1,"One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."
2,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those ""coolparts"" pay off big. Just saw them for ""Pledge Of Allegiance""and they were outstanding live."
2,"I liked that these were a lot softer than the Huggies Snug & Dry. The Huggies feel stiff and too much like paper.Absorbency wise, I tried both of these overnight and the Huggies had better absorbency.Overall, I like these diapers. They are soft and absorbency is pretty good. I'll keep using these since Amazon has a great offer. Can't beat this price."
2,"This is the one of the few books of poetry I've read that actually means something! Discovering this has really changed the way I think about verse and books in general. The best thing about it? NOT boring. I'm so sick of the innocuous, adjectival, over-written, meaningless poems in so many journals and ""literary"" magazines of our time. David Trinidad is smart--read for pure pleasure, and then read again and look for the subtle tricks and talent he employs to make these poems truly great art! Truly fresh, too. No one else is writing about our tarnished culture like Trinidad. He is truly unique, and like I said, the best compliment I can give is that this book is not a bore--something that 98% of all books of poetry these days are! Thank you Mr. Trinidad! You've got me reading and enjoying poetry again!"
2,"For a long time i've been waiting for this dvd, it becames my way of life, i bought a CB750 and a F-100 V8. These kind of vehicles really amaze me."
1,"I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
1,"Don't bother reading this book. Brokaw's sham will teach you nothing about the Second World War. Instead, read Studs Terkel's THE GOOD WAR or anything by Paul Fussell. Better yet, go talk to a veteran...We're lucky they're still around."
2,Very interesting. Recommend. Enlightening. One of the first I have actually read and will look for more. Very interesting personal life facts given.
1,"Don't waste your money. This is the worst printer I have ever owned. If this is an indication of other HP products, no wonder HP stock is tanking. Paper doesn't feed, display screen doesn't work, error light blinks continuously.I'm taking this into the back yard and going ""office Space"" on it."
1,"The _not_ Cobain character rambles, mumbles, stutters, attempts to write music and finally manages to kill himself, about five minutes before I was ready to kill myself.Avoid."
2,"This would have been a good season finale and season start, but to do it as a farewell episode. I liked the Ark of Truth better. This episode had a lot of concentrated action and a lot of wasted time. They could have made it longer with a bit more of what happens to them when they are not involved. It was not their best effort but it was still Stargate."
1,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
2,I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
1,"This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords."
1,"I gave up on this thing halfway through. I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though."
1,"The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining."
2,"Loved this book; I have read it, taught 2 classes from it and it has transformed my life and the lives of my students. \I highly recommend this book and Her TAPES to anyone and everyone interested in spiritual growth.Rev.JudyCockeysville, Maryland"
1,"Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
1,"As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning."
2,"If you are looking for something fun for any age, look no further. You simply must play it, you will be as addicted as we are."
2,TAFFY OF TORPEDO JUNCTION is about a 13 year old girl who lives on the Outer Banks off the N.C. coast during World War II. This book was exciting and easy to read. I would recommend this book to a friend because it gives the reader a chance to see how rough it was to live during a war. Taffy uncovers a group of German spies living on Hatteras and reveals their location.
2,"Finally a head harness that is meant to hold some weight!very sturdy construction, padded and adjustable!"
2,"I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product."
2,"I gave this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie. However, it is quite depressing at times. Diane Lane just can't catch a break. It is kinda slow, but I'm very pleased to have seen it."
1,"Just as the title says, book of nonsense. A book of poorly written rhymes, lacking even a hint of smutty humour."
1,"This is a Bad movie from start to finish.Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screenmovies has begun to play itself out. And its time for Hollywoodto find some fresh material to use.In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They arefairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!)But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really goodon film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine.Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix.I have two suggestions.1.Save your money and buy or rent much better movies.Such as the oringinal 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harrisand Claire Bloom. or ""Rosemarie's Baby"" with Mia Farrell.Or the overlooked mid 70's flick ""The Sentinal"".2.Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get outof the ""Matrix""!"
2,"Mr. Aiken's AMAZING VOICE and the beautifully written SONGS make this a MUST HAVE CD for everyone...There is a little bit of everything on this CD from upbeat love songs to moving ballads...Clay's voice really shines on ""I WILL CARRY YOU"", ""INVISIBLE"" and ""TOUCH"" have great upbeat tempos, ""RUN TO ME"" and ""NO MORE SAD SONG"" prove CLAY can really rock, and you just can't help but sing along to ""WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME"" which is my FAVORITE song on the CD... I recommend you BUY THIS CD TODAY!!"
1,"If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend ""The Night Lives On"" by Walter Lord."
2,"Well, I really did not know exactly what to expect from this CD, but, being that I am a Clay Aiken fan I had to have one. Not to mention the one that I have bought here at Amazon.com.. I played the CD and then played it again. And I have to say that I am happy with all the tracks on it. As a matter of fact I am having trouble deciding which one I like best. I did decide however that I would like to give this CD to a few friends of mine for Christmas gifts, so it was back to the store for me. I think that this is probably the best value for my music money spent in a long time. I thank you for the opportunity to express my opinion and review this CD. I hope all that purchase Measure Of A Man will enjoy it as much as I am."
1,"I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
2,"This is the first book of short stories I read by this author, I enjoyed the twist in all. I always loved reading him and cannot wait for another book. I have almost his entire collection."
1,"What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I read. I guess I should have read more of them, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie a total bore.I was hoping it would get better, maybe a surprise scene in the middle or the end of the movie but it never happened!That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back."
1,"I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not. I suggest you pass, unless this is a required movie for your Film 101 class."
1,"This movie is 2 plus hours of wasted time. Let me tell you the movie in one sentence: Mia Farrows husband in the movie is a struggling actor, who makes a deal with the Devil in order to procure more work. As a result, Mia Farrow's child becomes the son of Satan. That's the whole movie! There is absolutely no suspense, terror, horror...nothing. With the exception of a tense moment right before the 2 hour mark, this movie is boring and bland.Our DVD case states ""Roman Polanski's Award-Winning Film"". It's hardly award winning! The only winner was actress Ruth Gordon, who won for Best Supporting Actress. Other than that, I can't say what is so award winning about it. I will say that in my book, it is award winning for being one of the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen."
2,"I happened upon this product at Nordstrom's Rack and picked up one. Boy did I wish I had grabbed a handful. I have been buying Origin's automatic lip liner for about $22.00 a pop and these are just as good, if not better. On a lark I searched Amazon to see if they had them. Yep! I use the Black Berry as I like to wear dark and wine colored lipsticks. I am going to grab a handful this time. The liner goes on easily and keeps my lipstick in place. Makes a nice frame for the lipstick."
1,"This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it."
1,"i love this movie, but when i watched this dvd version of it, i thought for a moment that my tv was playing up.the sound and image are dreadfull !!!! adjusting sound and vision on tv doesn't help either, i prefer copying a video tape on dvd myself.that's not all, nowadays we expect a dvd to come with trailers, documentarys etc.. you know some extras to enjoy the whole surrounding that made the movie. here: NOTHING ! nothing at allcompare this with dvd of ""mildred pierce"" or ""straight jacket""they come with FAB extras.this dvd version is done with no effort at all."
1,"the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate. I'm going to stick with the chest strap for accurate readings."
2,"Kingsley interprets the writings of Parmenides and Empedocles in a different way than the usual mainstream traditions. Easy to follow and understand without all the intellectual jargon, also very enriching. I enjoyed this book and think it deserves the 5 stars. Some philosophers will disagree with his handling of the texts and interpretations but he shines a new light on a tradition that has otherwise been stagnating, and one that is refusing to accept new fresh ideas or theories. I would qualify him as a ""modern"" philosopher and his writings as ""modern"" philosophy. A definite read for all those with broad minds and horizons."
1,"Without going into detail about the movie. Which was great. I have to say Warner is horrible at Blu-ray transfers. The picture is very soft through out the movie. And Dobly Digital? Come on Warner. Thats good enough for your cable/dish box, but not blu-ray. This blu-ray does not take full advatage of what the technology can achieve. I would like to see a remaster of this blu-ray."
1,"I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay. I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive. It sat in an unoccupied room for one night- no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air. A serious amount air leaked out- it was visibly noticeable. I cannot imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it. This is a horrible product. It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep, I gave up. You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item. It was never slept on- period- and is unusable."
2,My husband took his LED Fan Light on RAGBRAI (Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) and was really impressed with and so were all of his friends. It withstood his tent blowing down and being ruined in a storm in the middle of the night.
2,"I have yet to receive my MOAM + 1 but since I have heard all the songs, I will give this cd a 5 star. I have listened to this cd everyday since its release and I have over 3000 cds. It says something about this cd and that is, it is that excellent."
2,"NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network.Didn't even need the enclosed drivers. Vista 64-bit connected the device without a hitch and it's been working flawlessly for about 1 year.EDIT 09/24/2011This device also works great with Linux Ubuntu 10.04..."
1,"This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
1,"I've had this amp for a few years and have been satisfied for most of the time, but it just quit working so ... now not so happy.I'm actually on my second one because the first one I received only worked for a week before failing. It was replaced under warranty and the second model worked fine for a few years.I've been using it to power several sets of speakers throughout the house. I recently moved some components around and after plugging everything back up the amp no longer worked. I checked the fuse and it was blown, so I replaced it but the new fuse blows as soon as I turn the amp on even though I don't have any inputs or speakers connected.So, now I'm shopping for a new amp."
1,This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
2,"Martnez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalb evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure."
1,"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a ""must read"" for women as young as 10!"
2,"I feel very lucky to have found this book. Though i am not as psychically gifted as the author describes some folks, this book has helped me tremendously. I have learned to meditate and do now appreciate its importance. I have learned where the help i have received is coming from. This book has helped me understand a lot of important things and i'm very greatful. Thank you Sonia!!"
2,"SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
1,"Never was I so worried and scared in my life than when I read this book. I hope and pray that I will never have to use most of the information, because it only deals with the problems, not the pleasures. And I cannot believe the book emphasizes using a midwife for multiples!! I'm happy with my experienced and knowledgeable physician!!"
1,"I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
2,"This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work."
1,"Carlton thinks she is so damn profound, oooooo you came up with one of the most self important pseudo intellectual album names ever in ""Be Not Nobody"" Be Not Nobody? Try ""Be not educated."" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real ""intelligent"" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."
1,"This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."
1,"I think the plot of this movie was the difference between being loving and being selfish in an unberable and confusing situation. The plot and Christian perspective was a bit limited and could have been further developed. There were a few special effects that occured with more frequency as the movie progressed. These were better than I expected, but could have been better. The whole movie seemed a bit amateurish but I appreciated the Christian perspective it portrayed."
1,"Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on."
1,"I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."
1,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you....Jack Wagner reincarnated. Or is it Michael Bolton? Either way, this sound should have died with the 80's. For those who claim Clay is a boy band extension, may I respectfully say: PUH-LEEZE! The kid has a nice voice, but this is not pop music. This is your mom's Kenny G with vocals."
2,"It's a literary masterpiece, realistic as it can be, Goodbye Columbus makes you feel as if you were 19 again. Neil's way of looking at life makes him a very interesting protagonist.Roth really scored a hundred whit this book, he makes the reader relates to the selfish feeling of a typical collage student, like Brenda. It makes you laugh going into two different mentalities such as Neil's and Brenda's.Intriguing enough not to let the reader know every detail, but to give him the opportunity of drawing your own conclusion."
2,My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
1,"David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades."
1,"The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."
2,"Philbrick's award winning non-fiction retelling of the Essex tragedy captured my attention as a tale of family tragedy. As a father of teenage sons, I kept trying to imagine the lives of those families torn apart by the whaling industry and the misfortunes of the ""family"" of men on this whaling journey. Though Philbrick paints an oversimplified picture of the Quaker village life of Nantucket, once at sea, this book is hard to throw overboard.For two other non-fiction books on the family, take a look at THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME (winner of the national Catholic Press Association ""Family Life"" Book Award 2000), by David Robinson; and also by Robinson, THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY TOOLBOX: 52 BENEDICTINE ACTIVITIES FOR THE HOME (Crossroad, September 2001)."
2,Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years.
1,"We use a lot of diapers and frequently go back and forth between Pampers and Huggies as our child grows. Our 18 month-old son definitely wears size 4 but this version of Pampers seems slightly too small. Worse, the stick-on flaps are much less sticky than most diapers we use. Several times his diaper has actually come loose because the flap unsticks during the night resulting in a wet boy. Not sure if this was just a bad batch or there is something different with this particular model. We have not had problems with other Pampers in the past."
2,This book made me smile and made me cry. I now have a much better appreciation of my parents generation. My generation and the ones following should learn a valuable lesson from these people. We have become a selfish and lazy society and should be ashamed of ourselves. Thank you Tom Brokaw!
2,"the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
2,I ordered for my son who doesn't like to read. Because of these books he is now a reader! Thanks so much!!!
1,This game is based on the movie but is not much like it as far as exciting goes. Don't waste your money on such a buggie game! It would be worth buying the two towers instead. The two towers for GBA starts early in the movie so you won't miss the some of the first seens in the Fellowship. My advice is NOT to buy this game!
1,"This book is repetitious and after several episodes, boring. Tom Brokaw should stick to reading the news on NBC. If you want a good book on this subject, read,""Citizen Soldiers."" You will not regret it."
1,"This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
2,"I worked on this puzzle on a cruise and just had to buy it when I got home. It's a hard puzzle, but a wonderful scene."
1,"We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again."
1,"Did you know that the writers/performers worked all night on Tuesdays? Or that Lorne Michaels was a dysfunctional father figure? Well you'll be reminded about every fifth page of this yawner. Sure there's some interesting gossip and sniping, but save yourself some time and get the cliff notes because this is about 100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book."
1,"Sisterchicks on the Loose by Robin Jones Gunn has got to be the worst book of 2011 for me. Yes it is ""fluffy"" but also just plain boring. Most of my fellow readers in ""Friendship Sisters Bookclub"" thought it was an ""ok"" story. I just did not appreciate the story and thought quite frankly that it was slow and boring."
1,"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."
1,"Made the mistake of buying an after market part made in China, thinking I could save some money. That was a mistake the part arrived on time, the fit was correct, however, the two mounting supports that receive the screws cracked right away when mounted on the truck one breaking off completely. I ended up ordering the Ford part and had no problems."
1,"Well after my printer almost lasted one year, and completely became useless just out of the warranty time...started searching the web for the 1020 support group.I see probably what we all see when our wonderful 1020 dies.Well, it doesn't DIE, it slowly comes apart, the piece of gray film, called TEFLON starts coming apart. Your printing will be sloppy, then your printer will start eating paper. Then you will look on here and see that you shouldhave bought the DELL monochrome, OR you SHOULD DEFINITELY BY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. Buttttt,,,,what is up with those laser cartridges. They do notlist any yield size. I'm not happy with HP right now, can you tell?"
2,Great factual read. Very similar to dan Browne style novel. If you like dan Browne you'll love Steve berets well written to the point novel. Great read.
1,Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Don't waste your money. It's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared. Doesn't heat up to any degree that will be helpful. Still waiting to hear back from the supplier (two weeks now) to return this item. Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $10.... Enough said
1,"This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."
1,I have bought four boxes of this product in the past year and had been very happy with it till this latest box. We had to throw away a number of the diapers because the elastic is loose and doesn't conform to the baby's thighs at all. The waistband also tears if the baby moves a lot. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
2,WOW!!! Liz keeps you rockin' with guitar licks and a great voice. The only thing better than seeing her perform in person is rockin' along with her in your car. GOOO LIZ!!!!
2,"I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old."
1,"As a Noni user for many years, when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni. When it arrived was disappointed to see not PURE Noni juice, but rather adulterated Noni with fruit juice. I use NONI not for the taste, but the health benefits, yes NONI tastes bad, but I want the benefit of the NONI not additives to make it taste better. Can't recommend this product."
2,Sea Runners will etch the coastline of British Columbia in your mind. An awesome tale.
2,As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.
1,"The swaddlers are wonderful diapers, never had any problems, however, the Dry Baby diapers are terrible. We have gone though one box of them, and still have another one to go before we switch over to cloth (this is not the reason we are switching to cloth). My son has woken up several nights in a row completely wet and we've been having to change the sheets. They leak horribly. Even daycare hates them. We've had so many blowouts as well. They are incredibly thin and cheap feeling."
2,"This is truly a timeless book. Great for young or old. The illustrations are beautiful and at this price you won't be disappointed. My wife and I shared this book with our granddaughter and she would ask us over and over ""let's read Ratty and Mole"". We are so happy to be able to find this edition again and share it with our great-grandchildren."
1,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
2,Receiving this product was right on time. My opinion of the book was very informational for me.
1,"""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."
2,This cd really rocks. SOAD has such a unique and energetic sound. If you like Tool you'll love this cd. I also recommend their debut cd. buy it!
1,"This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH"""
1,"I opened the box, took them out and immediately ran into problems: the attachment to the headset was way too tight and it was impossible to sit them all the way in. This is important because you want them to sit as close to your eyes as possible. After using considerable force, I was able to clip them halfway on....and then it stuck. I didn't even bother buying batteries before sending them back."
1,"This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!"
1,I didn't realize this book was written in such small print. This is the only thing I don't like about it. Sorry!
1,"I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book."
1,"There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape."
2,Why?Because of Colin Firth and Maggie Smith and Judy DenchAlso My daughter in Germany only has her Video Library for entertainment so I send them to her
2,"If you are willing to try just 1 CD of Pete Seeger to get an idea about his music, listen to this. It has almost all his hits.I especially loved -GuantanameraLittle Boxes,Where have all the flowers gone,We shall overcome"
1,"I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
1,"After taking an internet perfume quiz and falling into the 'Bohemian' catagory, it was suggested I may like this scent. Oh God... it is horrible. It doesn't just smell like ""Dirt""... a nice earthy ""I've been gardening"" scent... it smells like dirt from a landfill. The clerk laughed when I actually gagged."
2,"I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun."
1,This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one.
1,"Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
1,"I was very excited about reading this book, especially knowing it was a series. The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting. If you agree with this review and have read the other books and Mr Moody's writing style has changed please let me know."
2,"Tried many brands, Pampers is always the best. Soft and dry. Baby loves it! Especially in summer! From 8 month, my baby started to use size4. No leaking."
2,"I read this book about a month ago, and I have to say, it's... okay. There are some really good stories in it, some that really made me say, wow, who is this new guy. But then there are other stories where I wonder agin, who is this guy (but in a weirded out way). I really liked the comedy stories, The Art of Romance, and How To Make A Man Cuddle were pure genius, I literally laughed out loud. Some of the sad stories are a bit schmaltzy, but decent. The one I didn't really care for was Bunjiro. NOt that it was a bad story, I just think that he needed to make this its own seperate book. All in all I recommend this book the stories are so diverse that I feel that this author is worth a looking into. This book seems to be his way of testing the waters and testing his abilities as a writer. Would I buy a second book by him. You bet!"
1,"Though this work excellently represents the history of a madman, it is missing the necessary evidentiary links which tie in the suspect to the facts. There is nothing which, in a compelling way, brings the suspect even close to the victims and the evidence which is well documented. It was an enjoyable read nontheless."
2,"My 16 month old has been playing with this off and on for about a month, and she can now put every single number in the correct place every time without a second of hesitation! Because the numbers are written below each space, she now even recognizes the WORD for each number! Am I ordering the alphabet puzzle immediately."
1,"I wish I could give this game negative five stars! Whoever gives this game five stars is a complete loser who doesn't have any good games. This game is not really fun and it has major glitches in it. Why get this game when there are games like Super Mario World, Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2, or a Pokemon game! And I am not biased against Lord of the Rings games or anything like that because I enjoyed playing the Two Towers and Return of the King for the Gamecube. This game is fun for the first 15-30 minutes though. My final words are DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!"
2,"This may be my favourite Mayhem album of all. As opposed to the crude ""deathcrushing"" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of ""De Mysteriis,"" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before. Usually very fast, sometimes atmospheric (all done w/out synths, except for the ambient intro track), and always hellish - every aspect of this music is absolutely insane, and it definitely gives hope for a grim future."
2,"How good looking and how thin, it can stay in the laptop when you finish working on the Apple.Also hard to buy if you are ordering it in the Netherlands.Amazon.com blocked the buy and didn' make clear why I couldn't order it from the Netherlands!Maybe one day I will receive an answer?"
2,"I received a TiVo box for Christmas and hooked it up in January. Instead of running wires all over the place I purchased the TiVo wireless USB adapter to connect the TiVo box to my existing wireless network. I simply actived the TiVo service online, then plugged the TiVo box to my home theatre, plugged in the TiVo wireless adapter, and followed the on-screen menu instructions. Everything worked perfectly, the first attempt. How many electronic / computer products do that, do you think? By the way, I am just an average computer user with few networking skills. I chose the TiVo brand adapter instead of others available to assure easy software compatibility."
1,"Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it. Like i said, not much to say....i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 3.99 back!!!!"
1,"With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music."
2,"While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library."
1,I ordered the headphone extension (1 male end/1 female end) and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug (2 male ends). I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back.
1,"Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing."
1,"Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
2,"These are adequately absorbent, no offensive scents from the diaper material (before being used). Easy to use restickable tape. I have used these diapers in varying sizes since day one without any problems (except that they cannot handle all the urine of a 2 year old overnight). I never had rash problems that I can attribute to these diapers."
2,"Was introduced to the lads by my daughter, Lindy. They performed in Cheyenne, Wyo last summer (looks like they'll be back this year too (can you see me smiling? ) I saw them last September in Estes Park, and they are brilliant ! Their upbeat numbers will get your feet tapping, your hands clapping and your heart pounding. My favourite, however, is a much slower one: Men of Erin,, it'll give you goose bumps and bring a tear to your eye,,,, We love ya, lads,,,, Slainte !"
1,"Wouldn't it have been nice if the _not_ Kurt had gone with Kim Gordon? He could've been a member of the family. How cool would that be to have Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents? Kurt could have sat on the floor surrounded by kittens,making drawings of sperm and embryos with crayons.this over indulgent pile might as well have been about nothing at all, instead ol' Gus decided to cash in on Kurts name. the real question is, why not? everyone else did."
1,"Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
2,"Where George Orwell's 1984 was an attack on Stalinism, We is an attack on Leninism. This makes it particularly uncomfortable to Communist apologists who like to blame the brutality of the Soviet Union on Stalin, while freeing Lenin of any respondsibility. Zamyatin contradicts any such whitewash; the ""Welldoer"" (Lenin), is still just a dictator. A prison, even a comfortable one, is still a prison. Individuality Zamyatin argues, is too high a price to pay for security. The writing is excellent, the story is timeless, and the novel is a triumph of both Science Fiction and political satire. This is the book that made ""liquidation"" a euphemism for murder"
2,Most of these herbs have sprouted. I was surprised at how tiny most of the seeds are. They are difficult to only place a few in the soil at a time. (not anyone's fault) I will update when I transfer to the garden this summer. Shipping was fast and included was a direction sheet for how to grow this medicinal garden. So far So good!
2,"I was prepared to love this CD before it came out because I love to listen to Clay sing anything. It's one of the few CD's/albums I've ever heard that I don't want to skip any songs, and have several favorites that I think would also play well on the radio, if given the chance. I've heard other reviews of ""too sappy"", ""vanilla"", etc., but I don't see that. Just good songs (don't all songs have cliches?) catchy tunes, and of course, Clay's powerhouse voice, which always makes me smile. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is not Clay's fault. It's because on a couple songs, such as ""Run to Me"", the background music tends to drown out Clay's voice, and THAT'S what I want to hear. Other than that, I would tell everyone to buy this album and I would gush about it, and Clay as I always do when I get the chance."
1,"Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
2,"I don't care about all the hype, I dig this record a lot. I play it, then I play it again. it's almost always in my head. I wish I had four more of her records. the performance is very loose and the production is really tight. rollicking, rowdy, catchy as hell. she's got a great spark."
1,"Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"
2,I bought two of these; one for an office colleague and one for me. Everyone loves playing with it; they can't help but stop by my office and draw in the sand. It's pretty great for the value. I'm getting ready to buy another one for home.
1,I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
2,"This version uses footnotes too much. Every little unclear word is attached to a footnote. It's very distracting when reading and takes you away from this book. A lot of the words don't need to be footnoted, I guess the editor thought that the people who would read this would be idiots."
1,"The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"
2,"A very, very long movie that will hold your attention with some of the greatest cinematography, ever, and a well-told story of passion, intrigue, and haunting evocation of what is truth? One of the ten best movies of all time. Extraordinary!"
2,"The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star."
1,Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same.
1,"I find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff. He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of mid-air, supposedly based on the brain research. If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this, read it carefully. He jumps to conclusions with little to no evidence to back it up. Plus, he is neither a teacher nor a neurologist. He just found something he can write about and sound like an expert. Plus the writing seems written for, we'll, let's say, young readers. Very simplistic, which is not always bad, but in this case, it is.Again, read carefully. Analyze his statements and look for the actual scientific proof for them. You will be hard-pressed to find any, either in his book or elsewhere. Total fluff."
1,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
1,"Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she read a few pages and quit because it was too sad. I told her it had a good ending but she won't try again, be prepared for tears when you read this one."
1,"I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says ""for novelty only"" which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people."
2,"I originally bought this game after reading reviews on Amazon. It states ""ages 12 and under"", but play it almost every day with my 6 year old daughter. While she needs coaching from time to time, this is a strategy game that a young person can play that will adults will also enjoy. All but one or two of the times I have played this game it has only been with one other player, so I cannot talk a whole lot about how good the game is beyond two player. But in the two-player game, even a novice player can pick it up after one or two games and be very competitive. This game requires each player to adapt strategies to his or her opponents moves, so each game requires original thinking and planning. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a quick, competitive strategy game."
2,"I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
2,"The film is great in every way. Truly a prison ""film noir"" classic. But everytime I watch it, I always, wonder ""Six guys in a cell and no toilet."" Must have been quite a problem!"
2,"We have enjoyed all of the Rudy Maxa DVD travel series, especially in BluRay. The programs help when viewed prior to travel and are most enjoyable post-travel. Rudy captures and best of every location. He also enjoys food and beverage, which we appreciate in our household."
1,"Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
1,I thought that because the DVD stated Season One that I was getting the entire season one. Much to my surprise it only included six episodes. I now know that unless it states COMPLETE season it isn't. I was quite disappointed and feel that the advertising is misleading.
2,Excellent book for those among us who are working to integrate the Reggio approach into our U.S. early childhood classrooms.
1,"Although The Third Secret is the first and only book I have bought and/or read from Steve Berry, I was not impressed. The first two thirds of the book was written well. The book bviously puts the Catholic church in a very bad light. The mysterious untold portion of the third secret (which is what keeps you reading the book) was so bizaar and completely rediculous that it blew away any semblance of believability that the reader may have had up to that point. What a severe let down. Fiction of this type has to retain some trace of believablity even to the end. I can not recommend this book."
1,"This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
1,"I found this book to be extremely boring. While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like. The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes."
2,Really like this product and love the price. My daughter is expecting her first and am getting ready for the new baby. Love it!!
2,"Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands."
1,"I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. The gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. These may be OK but not for my application."
2,"I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles."
2,"This CD proves without any doubt why Clay has his popularity. He is an amazing singer and true entertainer. People may be jealous, dazed and confused but Clay is a winner no matter what you people may say. Hell, Clay has gone triple platinum. Can Ruben say that, I think NOT! Ha! Ha! Who did you get your info. from. Jealous Mother Fu*kers trying to have you cake and eat it too."
1,"Diaper didn't last through the night. My 2 year old woke up multiple times needing to be changed (totally unusual for him). The gel beads inside the diaper became really cold when wet and the diper completely ripped open, allowing the wet, cold gel beads to spill all over the place. I'm going back to my normal pampers and just getting the next size up--hopefully that works."
1,"Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry ""Forever February"" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Don't Mess With Mr. T"" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances."
2,For the money this is the best quality sound and options. You can have 5-10 people all in the same office using at the same time with no feedback or echoing.
1,"Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
2,"Herb and Jan Conn were amateur climbers in the 1930s who fell in love with the Black Hills of South Dakota. At a friend's suggestion, the Conns began moonlighting as spelunkers in winter. When they first visited Jewel Cave, it was a tiny cavern with an intriguing unexplored passage. Luckily for the Conns, that passage led to a mile of unexplored cave passages, then two miles... and exploring Jewel Cave became the Conns' life's work. They describe the exciting exploration (which is still ongoing, with more than 100 miles of passages mapped) with just the right balance of action/adventure, science, and humor. This book is a pioneer of the outdoor/geography genre and is readable, fun and fascinating.-Review by David Bezanson"
1,"Very disappointed by this movie. The book was great and so I anticipated the movie would be as well, especially after seeing who was going to star in the movie.Very disappointed. Slow moving movie - lots missing..."
1,"John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
2,"I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie."
1,"It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets."
1,"I saw this billed as a ""super hero"" style movie. I read the description, and was hesitant to watch it, but it had a fairly high rating, and I could sort of imagine a guy with ""super powers"" to kick some demon tail. What I got instead was a rather depressing, horror flick. To me the story line stunk. This could have been fun. It had good special effects, yet it managed to depress me and bore me. Really disappointed!"
2,This CD is one that you will never get tired of. Jennifer's talent and sound are incredible. She is one of the most gifted artist's I've ever listened to. I would recommend this CD to anyone and have already bought it as a gift for most of my acquaintances.
1,"I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
1,CRAP!The original Haunting from 1963 has long long been my favourite ghost story....So I was excited tho needless very apprehensive about this remake. Somehow I knew modern Hollywood would mess it completely up. And they did not disappoint me.Completely changed the whole background and story line. Instead of the subtle and eerie horror...you get the gore and obvious.Don't waste any time on this junk. Of course if you are like the majority of clueless americans...this might be right up your alley.
1,"it amazes me that after so many years and so much exposure that this book is still in print. the only story i have ever read that is worse than these is Moby Dick. the only thing worse than those 2 books are the movie adaptations. i'd rather pull out my own fingernails with red hot pliers than to read the cave bear again. a insanely long and over written pile of trite tripe.'a festering bag of fish entrails' is too kind a review for this load of sewage. if anyone tries to make you read this book, slit your wrists and fling yourselve from a cliff first - it will be less painfull."
1,This book was an alright book. It starts out with Lennie and George in a town called Weed. Then Lennie's obsession with soft things gets them in trouble. They go to another ranch where they meet a few people. Then Lennie gets them in trouble with these new characters. I didn't like this book that much because I don't like to read and it was a boring book. I would only recomened this book to people who like boring books and people 13 years of age and older.
2,"Asimov wrapped up the Foundation/Robot/Empire saga quite well in Foundation and Earth. I must admit I was a bit confused by the book as I read the Foundation series starting with Foundation before I read any of the Robot/Empire Novels or even Prelude to Foundation or Forward the Foundation. Despite my confusion, I was impressed with the book even then."
2,Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role.
2,"The only information that should be corrected, is that JEAN lived in Temple City and not Arcadia. The house is still there, on Golden West, about a block north of the park and City Hall!"
1,"I bought this first alert CO alarm for my home in Wisconsin.When I started to read the instructions I found that this product is not UL list! How can a safety item like this not be UL listed.I did some research and found out first alert changed testing labs to save a few bucks and do not use the most well known UL. What's up with that...So I returned this CO and purchased the Kidde KN-COB-DP-H Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm. The Kidde unit cost less too, so I saved a few dollars! Always pays to READ THE FINE PRINT."
1,(...)! Where was Sandy and Gary?! I watch this ocassionly and hate it! Sponge and Patrick go on an adventure to save the world! Already done! Two best friends on a journey to save the world! Best Part was when...wait no best part!Worst Part: When Spongebob was on David hasslehoffs leg!I reccomend Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events coming to DVD April 26!
1,"This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying."
1,"I have flowen model rockets for over 40 years now, and the parachutes that Estes is making currently are an embarassment to the company! They are made of cheap plastic instead of nylon. The plastic often tears away from the cloth cords, and the cords tangle easily. Added to these problems, the chute often does not fully deploy if the plastic chute is not powdered to make it less ""sticky"". And forget about launching in cold temperatures as the plastic has a ""memory"" and often fails to open in cold weather.Estes plastic parachutes, no matter what size, are a disaster to be avoided. Pay la little more money for a nylon parachute and it will last as long as the rocket.Jim Konedog Koenig"
2,"Chumbawamba is an underground British band that has been around for almost 20 years. They had a stroke of surprising luck in 1997 with the infectious dance/sports anthem Tubthumper. However, that song is not a good representation of their sound. Musically they remind somewhat of Scissors Sisters with a little Frankie Goes to Hollywood or maybe a rebellious Abba with a few shots of whiskey in them. Their lyrics are very political in a very abstract way and written for a British audience at that. The CD is also filled with many anarchist spoken-word soundbites. I checked out their very active website and they are selling t-shirts with George Bush's face above the label TERRORIST and the back of the shirt says ""You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs"". Even Tubthumper is about ""shouting to change the world, then having a drink to celebrate""."
2,"This is one of the best Barbra has ever done, I have listened to it in full probably ten times since last week when I bought it. It is so incredible. I am waiting for the day that this is out in DVD to see her in action while I listen to her. God has truly blessed her with unbelievable talent."
1,"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an ""and"" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."
1,"The only good song is Grillz, Nelly strait up bombed on the sweitsuit cds plain and simple. Nelly sells to female fans period. He needs to get some country grammar action again. Paul Wall, ALi and Gipp saved that song Grillz."
1,"This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ..."
1,"As person who recently realized they have a problem with quiet anger I was heartened to find this book. The Description on the back cover seemed to describe a good methodology to work on anger management and the first chapter was encouraging.However, it quickly became evident that there was a lot of religious content in the book and in some cases it was counterproductive. Not all of us can simply believe that God made this so and we need faith to press on.There is a lot of good material in this book. However, after progressing a third of a way through it I simply couldn't take the religious references and leaps of faith the authors used to dilute what was a promising way of handling anger.An actively practicing Chrisian would probably find this book helpful. Anyone else should keep looking."
1,"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,The costume was perfect for my daughter and the best part is the costume came with every thing you need to be a very adorable batgirl. The quality was good as well.
2,"Thomas Beecham (1879-1961) is not thought of today as a major Wagner conductor, but he did conduct a number of Wagner's music dramas at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and has recorded a number of Wagner overtures and preludes, including this collection.Although the early- mid 1950s sound will be an issue for some, I urge serious collectors to consider this recording, as it shows Beecham's mastery of Wagner. A great alternative to other Wagner collections of Bohm (DG), Karajan (EMI), Furtwangler (Naxos Historical and EMI), Bernstein (Sony) and Ormandy (Sony).Highly recommended."
1,"My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"
2,"I've never been a huge fan of Voivod, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Very raw and over-the-top, with raspy vocals and plenty of energy. I'll definitely be checking out some of their other stuff as well, as this one is really growing on me..."
2,"This is probably the most important punk album since Never Mind the Bollocks. It combines a unique snarling rage with true wit and intelligence to produce this masterpiece. Political (or as they put it anti-political) but not preachy. But don't worry - you won't find the naive politics of bands like the Crucifux, the Dead Kennedys or Crass here. The impact of the songs of this album can't be overstated. I just wish they were still around. I wonder what they would be like now."
2,A real page turner. Andy is great. See that your friends don't steal this book from you.Thejendra BS
2,"Very catchy, ambitious and intelligent lyrics. This guys are awesome, with tight musicianship and perfect vocals. My version is without de DVD, and i'm a little dissapointed about that, just for this. Recommended if you like Gamma Ray and Primal Fear."
2,"Arrived in a very reasonable amount of time. Connection and set up was very easy. This is my third one of these for three tivos, and I've yet to have issue with any of them."
1,"One of the bottle leaked. Fluid all over, contaminated almost everything, including some other items in the same delivery package."
1,1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
2,"Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more, the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain, their joy, their search, their honesty, the lies, the hopes, the hot , out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears, and compassion, and much, much more. Hot, hot, hot."

1,"Wait for the paperback. This book is a rehash of earlier works. It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as ""absurd"". His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot."
2,"Unlike the other reviewers, i'll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. I got BOTH!GRaphic-NBA2003 had better graphics, smoother movement and brighter textures.Sound-NBA2k3, cuz of ESPN!!!Value-2k3 hands down. I don't know why... but it last longer. and Online Play nuff said....Gameplay- 2003 is more casual friendly, which means even if you're not into Basketball you could still find some fun here. And with their innovative Freestyle right joystick control, its deffinitly funner.While 2003 could be funner for a shorter amount of time, 2k3 is the real winner if you took your time for Seasons.... Which one's better is really a matter of taste."

1,"i bought the DVD because i though they wouldn't just give the blue collar name to anyone... turns out they did.Caparulo was okay but the other 3 guys were not as good as i would have hoped. I think maybe i have been spoiled by the likes of bill, ron, jeff and larry."
2,"This little card installs flawlessly on Windows 7 and then just works like a champ. Great connectivity while connecting to a Linksys WRT54G from a fairly difficult location (downstairs and across the house!). Very happy with it, especially at this price,"
1,"It was great at first, but after a few weeks of light duty, it will no longer feed the paper. It keeps saying it is out of paper, but it isn't. If I ""nudge"" the paper with my finger, it will print.Oh well, I should have known better than to give HP another chance."
2,"The Pyramid Bottom Bracket bike stand is a great option to take along on those overnight rides. For example, when I do the DALMAC ride it allows me to stand my bike up during the overnight stays instead of laying it down on the ground or trying to find a (scarce) tree at the campground. With my bike standing I can then hang my riding clothes on it to dry in the sun. For these reasons I highly recommend this portable bike stand."
2,"Masterton has done it again. This book surprised me and also scared the hell out of me at times. People in the reviews are complaining about this book being a rip off of other books...give me a break. This has a HP Lovecraft twist but in a Masterton way! He brings out the FLAVOR of it all. the ending was a disappointment with what the character does, but hey, that is life in the real world. If you enjoy a really creepy haunting tale, this one is for you...."
2,this product is awesome. it hide all your secrets. I would recommend this product to all women and men. I will buy product again.
1,"I bought this software one month ago. I was required to immediately update it to fix problems that existed with the version I bought. I was able to navigate the program with ease and build a slide show with-in minutes. Now, for the bad news. It would not burn onto a cd-r as described. I contacted v-coms tech support and received a response within a day or two. The patch did not fix the problem and now after several attempts to reach them again, it seems I am stuck with another neat idea that doesn't work. Still waiting for help."
1,"how can anyone with half a brain not see through this viper? not only is this book a farce, just look at him on tv, CLUE > he does NOT EVER SMILE, he just peers into the tv like some WWE Wrestler.another clue, he and his ""brethren"" are all peeps in the south, they believe just about anything.Matt 3:7But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ""Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Matt 12:34Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.Matt 23:33Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?"
1,"I find it very frustrating not to be able to choose my own color! If this practice was changed, I might order this product!"
2,This is an amazing book with ideas for ways to celebrate the winter holidays in old traditions long forgotten yet brand new for those of us who have did not know. To entertain without it being entirely 'commercial' is exciting and spiritual. I'm buying a few more copies for gifts!
1,"My Dad bought a Tivo for my Mom for Christmas, and we were all very excited about it. However, eventhough it was easy to hook up, as soon as it was it started conflicting with our HD channels and it messed up our sound. Also, it goes on rampages taping shows at random and quickly filling up the given 80 hrs. I figured the sound problem was probably just loose audio wires which I checked time and time again. I called the tech support where I waited on hold for almost an hour then they told me that sometimes the audio feed would fragment and they offered to replace the Tivo if I shipped it back in its original box... More effort than its worth.. Should've gotten the Charter DVR. I dont recommend this product if you have a cable box."
2,"Prince Caspian has everything you want in a movie. Action, drama, suspence and even an unexpected romance. But the thing that really blew me away was the originality.It wasn't The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe all over again as most sequels are. It is so much more intense and in-depth than the first one. The feeling, aroma andpresence is a whole new concept. Even the majority of the charaters we've never seen before (with the exception of the Pevensie children, Aslan, Hunger, Thirst,and yes, the White Witch). Now I know the producers didn't write the original story, but isn't that the delimna of all modern age movies? C.S. Lewis deserves much ofcredit for this masterful production as he was the one who started the legendary chronicle. Prince Caspian was definatly the best movie of it's time and I give itfive stars as it deserves. After all isn't Narnia supposed to be magical?"
1,"Worst thing ever... I don't know how anyone could even wear this thing... It is so uncomfortable, and it hurts to sit down... and it makes you look lumpy. It's in my drawer collecting dust. I've owned it for almost a year, and gave it many chances, and I still can't get comfortable with it. I'm better off getting the cheap one at the local mall or some plain ole spanks!! Kudos to anyone who can wear this thing all evening under a beautiful cocktail dress or gown... not me!!! I wouldn't recommend it to family or friends... it is overly priced."
2,I used Pampers for my 1st child and doing so again with my 2nd. They fit great on kids who are wider through the hips and behind.
2,"I bought this CD without even previewing it, as I'm a Moya fan. Even still, I was blown away by the beauty of it, the simplicity of the vocal lines, and the intricate way in which the tunes are arranaged. This is not your ordinary 'holiday' clone CD; with one more boring recording of the same dozen or so overdone Christmas carols! All of the tracks offer refreshing new 'advents' into the wonder of the Winter Solstice Season. A haunting, blissful album!"
1,"The illustrations are great, but the text is too small. There is no way to increase the size of the text. Get your magnifying glass out."
1,"I was expecting the author to continue with some Dickensian darkness and magical whimsey. The darkness was certainly delivered...and with heaping doses of vulgarity to boot. A dry read most certainly NOT reminiscent of the tone of ""A Christmas Carol""--as one is led to expect by the book's abstract--I stopped reading it after the fourth chapter and haven't missed it at all!"
2,"I've been an enormous fan of Yoko Kanno for over a decade now and just now bought my first Escaflowne soundtrack! I own the show and am familiar with the music, but decided to buy the third one first to get past some of the more listened-to background music. This works with most OSTs for anime and Escaflowne is no exception, these songs are wonderful and most are full length 3-4 minute songs. This is a sound track for any real anime/Kanno fan out there."
1,"There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than ""we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm."" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."
2,"Equip yourself with this handbook of New Age facts, doctrines, comparisons, and rebuttals. This manual will help you educate the precious souls that are being blinded by the dangerous New Age movement. Learn the difference between the Jesus they preach, and the Jesus we know."
2,"this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile."
1,"I was a HUGE Clay fanatic throughout all the AI hype. I fell in love with his voice and his personality and dashing good looks. However, this CD disappointed me. The voice that I fell in love with was his ""live"" voice, and I don't like his ""studio"" voice very much. I like 2 or 3 of the songs on the cd, but it makes me sad to give it a bad review, because I was looking forward to this cd since May."
2,"I really enjoyed being able to listen to a CD for a change and actually be able to understand and relate to the words of the songs. At times, unfortunately, Clay's voice seems to be obscured by the music----too bad, his voice is phenomenal! Great job Clay! Keep up the good work!"
1,"This book and the setting seemed to have so much potential, yet Gloss failed to give soul to her characters. I never identified with any of the characters or cared about their future. The bad guys were evil, the heroine heroic, the cowboys shallow but no characterization beyond the stereotypes. Page after page of obstacles to overcome, yet no insights to be gained. If this book hadn't been a selection of my book group, I never would have stuck it out to the end."
1,"This cd should be burned. any record from no limit should be, they can't rap at all. if you want real rap, listen to talib kweli, chino xl, big L, mos def, etc."
1,"I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."
2,"I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price."
1,These diapers fell apart and left a huge mess of falling apart diaper. I now know I need to use a different kind for overnight but then they shouldn't be advertised as baby dry.
2,I am a big Clay fan !!!! I traveled over 1000 miles to see him at Memphis and I was at the Charlotte concert. I have been waiting for this CD. I bought 4 copies and i LOVE it. I have just about wore one out already !!! I have also purchased 2 Christmas CDs. I would buy anything that has Clay in it.. He is a true American Idol!!! Keep up the good work CLAY!!! LOVE YOU DEARLY!!!!!
1,In early December I ordered products from Sharper Image as Christmas gifts. Half of my order did not arrive and I never received notice as to why. Turns out I had to call them to find out the items were on backorder. I finally cancelled the order and a month and a half later THEY STILL HAVEN'T REFUNDED ME!Do yourself a favor don't buy from these guys they're comepletely disorganized.
2,"2006 has been packed with PG-13 horror films, lots of them. Then are the gore flicks (TCM the beginning), and other stuff. Finally, a good horror movie comes out in august: THE DESCENT, a British horror film with a good twist.STORY: One year after a car accedent, 6 women reunite in a cabin in the Appilachian mountains to Go on a caving expedition. When they arrive at the cave, the descent into the cave begins, and their exit is blocked. They keep praying and pushing, hoping for another exit, but a bunch of deadly creatures attack...THOUGHTS: THis is a cool movie. Good music, great s/fx, and great lighting, I thought it was cool that the only light was natural.SO see this film!"
1,"Great, another socially aware electro-dance record. I can't wait for the an Iraqi to come out with one about the current US led invasion."
2,"""The Mission"" provides an excellent high-level overview of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While the book doesn't address doctrinal-related issues (nor should it, as that's not its purpose), it does provide the reader with a foundation of some of the Church's key teachings.I found the book thoroughly enjoyable to read and re-read, as many pictures prompted a recall of my own experiences."
1,"I have a strong connection with excellent speed. The show stopped at least 4 times due to signal disruption. I have no problems with connection at any other time. When the video did play, the video was high-def half of the time. I purchased high-def, but it was not good sound or video quality. The price and availability are the advantages."
1,In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
1,"My son got this last year for his fourth birthday. He only played it a few times when it slammed down and somehow pinched his fingers hard enough to make him cry. He never wanted to play the game again, I ended up getting rid of it. There are too many other fun and safe games out there to bother with this one."
2,Is a great bed for the money!!.our son loves it!!! Easy directions for assembly and seems durable so far. Bed time is not a problem in our house!
2,"I recently got done reading ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"". It was well worth my time. I would reccomend this book to anybody and everybody. I liked this book because it was very easy to understand even though the story took place a long time ago. The author ""Speare"" made this book enjoyable for all ages. I really liked this book because ""Speare"" made the book believeable and down to earth, it wasn't anything wild or outrageous. You could tell that ""Speare"" put a lot of time and effort into the book. I also liked the book because it was a real PAGE TURNER. Page after page the book left me thinking what's going to happen next. The book was just so un-predictable!""Elizabeth G. Speare"" did a really nice job on this book. Even if you are reading this book for the first time or the fith time I think you'll enjoy the book ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond""."
1,"For a Finance Professor at NYU this book should be an embarrassment. It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."
1,"This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock. I'm loving Bjrk's vocals, all though over-produced to an inch of her life. This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic. Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons. The LP feels forced."
2,"Wow! I cannot say enough about the features that are on this recorder. Every thing that I can ask for in a hand held full size cassett recorder / player. The variable speed is excellent for long lectures or events. On a standard 90 minute tape you can set the recorder at half speed and get 3 hours on it! Good quality play back, voice activated, tape counter, mic / phone jacks, AC/DC, etc. My only concern is the long term quality - made in China verses Japan. For the money impossible to beat this deal. So good that my wife took it away and uses it!"
1,"This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
1,thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
1,"I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk."
1,"The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground."
2,"Don't expect any bat junk like ""shark repellant"" in this one. It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.Still all in all, this is a great picture - one that you can easily watch over and over."
2,This was a GREAT book! I typically am not a fan of alternate history (AH) but I could not put this book down what with the plot twists and a great surprise ending.Buy this book!
1,"I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic ""grit"" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!"
2,"1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending."
2,This book was very encouraging and an easy read. A must read for those who want to be encouraged in their prayer life.
1,"I was pleased with the quality of the pet stroller. It even has places for your water bottle, cell phone, purchases (bottom tray). Rec'd in perfect condition, and delivery time was quick."
2,"I was hesitant, at first, but being a great fan of Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant, how could I not see this film?!? Once I decided to rent ""8 Femmes"" I was not disappointed. In fact, I was most pleasantly surprised - the music, too, is a nice bonus. Isabelle Huppert gives a scene-stealing performance, and there is nothing bad to say about this film. See it, and enjoy!"
2,Great product and will continue to use this over the Dry Max! I would recommend this product to any mother! Will continue to order this brand until my son grows out of diapers!
2,"This is a lovely little book. It is filled with contemplations on the importance of simplicity and balance in one's life.A busy woman who has focused her life on success becomes enamored of Amish quilts. Her admiration is so great that she takes time out from her life to go and live with the Amish. There, she reflects on her own values and comes to realize that the act of doing is as important as the outcome. She also realizes that being a part of something, rather than standing out from others, is a more cooperative and giving way to live.How the author juxtaposes the meaning of things with the sentiment reflected in the quilts is very lovely and meaningful.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever had questions about what is important in life and their own core values."
1,"The Asylum has the reputation of putting out quickly produced rip-offs of major studio movies. Well they have gone across the Atlantic to ""borrow"" their next production. A Finish/German/Austrailian co-production called IRON SKY in which as a last ditch effort to save the 3rd Reich in the form of a base on the moon comes to fruition in 2018 when they return.The Asylum moved the new base to Antarctica and into the earth,added Josef Mengele,some flesh transplants and flesh eating bacteria bombs to this mess. I like some of the Asylum films because they are fun and SOMETIMES are pretty good. But after recently seeing IRON SKY this was painful to watch.The sets were pretty much non existant using warehouses for all the interiors( don't think a cinder block wall would be found inside a UFO).The only effects that worked were the air battles at the end and the ""machine"" Mengele is trying to get to work. This one is best LEFT at the center of the earth!"
2,"This is a classic, great movie. It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."
1,"I purchased this toolkit from Amazon along with a very high quality Wiha nut driver set (26592). As others have stated, the nut driver is not reversible. It looks to me like the single nut driver is designed to fit both a 2.2 hex nut and a 2.2 - 2.5 star hex nut.However, the Phillips screwdriver is a size 0, and the Costco reading glasses I have that have screws takes a #1 Phillips head screwdriver. The one in this kit is too small.In addition, the Costco reading glasses that I have which have a nut (Design Optics Slim Elite), use a 3.0 mm nut.Don't purchase this for Costco reading glasses.I gave the product a single star because of the misleading description which implies two nut drivers. The single, combo nut driver looks very roughly made compared to the Wiha tools."
2,This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
1,"I couldn't wait to get this CD,being a guitarist myself. Just give me straight Jimmy Ponder, not horns and other ""jazz types"". I am disappointed. Cuts two and four are the best. They are Jimmy. Too bad I couldn't have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :("
1,"There is some documenting of the workings of the US State Department - but the vast majority of this ""documentary"" is putting Mrs. Clinton up on a pedestal. I am very disappointed in National Geographic. Their documentaries are normally more substance and less propaganda."
1,"This is a reprint of the 1906 edition. Linotype and monotype were recent technological innovations. The Helvetica typeface was 50 years in the future. No one had yet thought of using endnotes rather than footnotes. A hyphen is recommended in cases such as: ice-cream, wave-length, common-sense, fountain-head, and view-point.A mildly amusing antique, but not useful for anyone actually doing writing, editing, or publishing."
2,This is a perfect story of everything working out in the end. Im getting married and so decided to watch all the wedding movies I could find this didn't disappoint at all. It was great to watch a non-american film gives you an eye into other cultures.
2,"I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders."
1,"I bought this book anticipating another great read like: A Good Walk Spoiled. What I got, however, was every tiny, irrelevant detail about every person even remotely involved with the US Open. For example, do we really care that the superintendant's son played junior golf at... Or do we need 10-15 pages on the Shinnecock Indians and the 1995 US Open at Shinnecock? Or that the workers at Bethpage enjoyed eating sandwiches at BK Sweeney's??? Or that the guy who caddied for Tiger in his practice round was frome Ireland and his family, blah, blah, blah... Come on. It was just too much clutter and noise.This from an avid, single-digit handicapper, from Long Island, who played Bethpage Black and went to the Open on Friday in teh pouring rain!I had every reason to love this book, but instead threw it away. Save your money. I wish I had."
1,Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
1,"This story was meant to be Jean Giono's gift to the world, but the publishers took over to make money. There are certain places on the web where you can still access this wonderful story the way in which the author intended."
2,This product works well and the seller shipped it in a reasonable time. I used it to repair two pairs of expensive shoes and the results are good.
2,It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good book. The portrayal of a working first time mom and the two different worlds is insightful. There were a couple surprise twists.
1,I bought this to replace an almost forty year old cup warmer. I wanted a black and more stylish one and this one looked good. Any good reviews about keeping their coffee warm with this warmer must come from people who drink quickly. I take about a half hour to drink my 8oz cup and that's why I need a warmer. The longer my mug sits on this warmer the cooler it gets. Don't be fooled by it's looks.
2,"Before I begin I must say that I'm a fan of Idols. However I only watched the final show of the American Idols in which Clay was a contestant, so I really didn't know much about him.Why did I get this cd? Well from what I saw he had potential. And I must admit that I was right. This cd is perfect for a gift for someone who is a fan of Idols. Clay has an amazing voice. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Well it's a good cd and all, but it doesn't have that gold quality. Don't get my wrong, I play this often when in the car but there's not a great variety between all the songs. 'Measure Of A Man' is definitely my favourite!If you're into this light-hearted, catchy music then you'll be right at home here. However if you want something deeper I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I don't regret purchasing this cd."
2,"This is a very good album. It's just difficult to pick up a vibe from it in my opinion. It is hypnotic and I find myself listening to it time and again. Although I can't get the idea out of my head that it's an album made up of afterthoughts.Some think it's more upbeat,I say it has more of a somber feel to it. The standouts for me are ""Farewell To Annabel"", ""That Same Old Obsession"" and ""It's Worth Believin'"". It has it's high points, but again, to me it's difficult to nail down a vibe."
1,These are the worst diapers that I have ever used. They leak after only 2-3 hours of use. If someone was to give me a case of these I would give them away. I have used no name brands that have stood up better than these. Do not waste your money on these diapers!
1,"I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book."
1,This thing is horrible do not buy it. Only one episode with Curly all else is terrible. Old clips and movies not funny at all Do no but this you will be very disapointeed as I was.
1,"Ohh come on, tell me, how many variations can he make when he hits the high pitches? 1? Put the lousy production of this album aside, he sings worse than an amateur. His voice is sonorous, but the only thing he's good at is to show it, without any feelings whatsoever. Analogy: a fish that doesn't know how to use its fins to swim."
2,"I have never read a book anything like this before. Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars."
1,"This printer is inexpensive and fast but does not seem to work with either Linksys (WPS54G) printservers, DLink printservers (DP-G310), or Hawking printservers (HWPS1UG). I went through several phone calls with excellent support people at both Linksys and Hawking Technology to no avail. I upgraded firmware and installation programs but as far as the printservers are concerned the HP does not exist on the network.I have no idea what the problem could be but the HP1020 is not printserver friendly as far as I can tell. It is not as if I am running some obscure printservers either. The printerserver's company's products are well known and stable."
1,"This is a good product, but highly over-priced. $10 for FOUR pieces of track ???????"
2,"If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in ""Australian language"" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing."
2,"This is a wonderful second chapter to the Narnia series. The choice of actors is excellent and the CGI mixed with the live action is completely cool. This is one of the few fantasy movies that makes for beleivable looking characters out of the non-human races. The first movie was great and followed the orignal story so well, and the follow-up did not fail in its mission either. The children have grown as have their characters and it is wonderful. The story from begining to end is intrigueing and again, follows C.S.Lewis' story so well, that I would defintly tell anyone to get this for their collection. A wonderful movie for anyone of any age."
2,"A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!"
1,"...I thought it was going to be another film like ""the Incredible Journey"" or even like ""air bud"". My son loves both these pet films and I thought this one would be cute like those. But, I actually found it to be alittle long and 'draggy'. I didn't really feel like it ever enticed even my attention. I just couldn't develop the love for the animals and characters in this one, like i did in ""the Incredible Journey"" and ""Air Bud"". Anyway, For [the money], I really can't complain. Maybe we'll give the movie another try in 6 months. I'll keep it in the video cabinet for now."
1,"Despite being a very well writen work, this ebook is over priced for the length and content. I have a paper copy sitting next to me, and even it is less expensive! I am disappointed."
2,This film is thoroughly entertaining and full of laughs. Cher is fantastic as well as Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast. Very funny and sensitive as well. Brooklyn at it's best! Loved it.
2,"This bought back so many memories of sitting down on Saturday evening to watch this series. The haunting soundtrack music of Clannad, the wonderful atmospheric forest and castle scenes, the good acting (on the whole) and overall entertainment value on a TV budget makes this a fantastic series.The quality may not be HD but overall it is very watchable and replaces my worn out VHS copies."
2,"Dr. Jeanne Shaw is an outstanding mentor and guide in the area of human relations and relationships, as reflected in her handbooks. From her decades of experience of counseling individuals and couples come the vital lessons that she has compacted into this handbook.I have learned so much not only about relationships, but about life and living from Dr. Shaw, that I remain eternally indebted to her."
2,"This sample test provides the look and feel of the actual PE exam.Amazon, I love your company, but your price can't compete in this case (almost $200 as I write this). I purchased this same book on the NCEES website for a small fraction of the price you charge here (around $40 plus shipping)."
2,"Though not strictly an historical piece, not a documentary, Zoot Suit shows an entertaining and engaging storyline. It does this while revealing an historical event and how it is indicative of the unequal justice of the past and present for non-whites and those not fitting the social norms set by white society. It is truly worth seeing but I have had to explain the Edward James Olmos character to several people. He is voice in Henry Reyna's head, the image of what a Zoot Suiter was seen as, narrator of the story, and a few other things all put together. See him as a shadow more than an actual character that all others can see."
1,I thought this book was overrated and disappointing. The plot was undeveloped and lacking and the characters were not lifelike. the ending was abrupt and silly. Overall the book was a major disappointment and not worth my hard earned money.
1,"I loved the old Jenga game and Uno and thought...wow...a game that has both! After receiving it, the tiles were made out of cheap plastic and when the tower collapsed, it was extremely loud. I ended up donating it to Good Will."
2,"This book helped me a great deal, when I was ready, to deal with my anger problem. Realizing that I had a problem was the first step. The authors take you through steps that really opened my eyes and made me aware of my choices. I love the spiritual aspects!"
1,"i have bought several of these types of camera's form other sellers that work way better. spend the extra couple buck for something reliable. now saying that, with the cost you can't be picky if you are willing to gamble.SECURITY - DON'T BOTHER ( the tuning is way to sensitive, whereas it it really hard to get a constant clear picture.I would not use it for home security of any type as i live in a townhouse, and when set up it literaly make a cracking sound on the monitor when the unit transmits through one wall. )the range is not 200 feet..... maybe 10 feet line of sight. the advertising is false and i think this is why it was a dissapointing buy. i spent $50 bucks on the same type of unit several years ago and it works through the entire house and outside with no problems. this one has trouble transmitting clearly in the same room if large.Sorry to the seller for the bad review, but people need to know the truth about the item."
2,The Tivo adapter is so easy. All you have to do is open the package and plug it into your tivo and your ready to go (just make sure you change your tivo settings). Great product
1,"At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!"
2,"Love this little warmer! It's great at keeping bottom of the mug warm, keep in mind you might have to shake the cups a little to warm up the whole cup. However, don't expect to warm up a cold drink."
1,"I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney."
1,"I despise this movie! Well, first off, my sister made me go to it. This movie takes soooo long to get going! There are a lot of flash backs. The last bit is the last 15 minutes of the whoel thing. Do yourself a favor and go see War of the Worlds instead."
1,"WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"
1,Pros: The concept is very good.Cons: Is over priced The ladder is very heavy and hard to adjust to certain positions because of the weight. Weight hampers carrying it around easily. If I had it to do over again I would not buy it.
1,I was mislead! This was marketed as the old style can. You even said people that bought this bought the old style pour spouts! THE OLD STYLE POUR SPOUTS DO NOT WORK WITH THE CAN. IT HAS THE SAFETY SPILL PROOF SPOUT AND IS ABSOLUTLY NO GOOD TO POUR GAS INTO AN OLD SYLE VEHICLE. IW WAS DELIBERTLY MISLED. This was a totla rip off.
2,I love Pampers Baby Dry. I've tried other brands but nothing compared. These are soft and hold up well for long periods of time (12 hours overnight). Highly reccomend!
1,I always read Belva Plain's new books since I have enjoyed her previous books very much. I found this book to be predictable from the onset. I looked at the front of the book twice to be sure I hadn't inadvertently grabbed a Danielle Steele book from the library shelves. The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative. I am certain that Belva Plain will return to her previous writing style with her next book(s)...please.
2,This is perfect for the twins I have we go thought the smaller amounts very quick but I buy a couple big boxes and I'm covered for a while
1,The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film.
1,I thought pampers were the best until I bought these. They are definitely economy. My son wet through them every time he slept. Size 2 should work fine for a 3 month old but these did not. I am back with huggies!
1,"The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."
1,"Up until now, I have never been disappointed in a book by C.S. Lewis: fiction, fantasy, non-fiction-all top-notch, gripping and beautifully told. I found the first person narrative of ""Till We Have Faces"" to be thoroughly unconvincing-it never rang true to me as a story told by a female protagonist. The language seemed unnecessarily stiff, even allowing for the style being imitative of epic prose. I would discourage anyone from reading this book as a first contact with C.S. Lewis (it's probably interesting as an anomaly for readers who are well-acquainted with his work.)"
2,"This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of ""boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married"" this movies looks at the question of ""then what?"" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better."
1,"The amp arrived and looked great for a refurbished unit. The price could not be beat. However my unit only ran for about ten minutes before the circuits began shutting off and on. So I let J&R Music World know about the problem and was told to return it at their cost. I received an emailed ups label and dropped it off to go out next day. I got a fast response from J&R and a proper credit was made. So although I didn't get a working amplifier, I did get the kind of service that would allow me to shop with confidence on Amazon.com ."
1,This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market.
1,"I watched as much as I could of this dreck, wondering why Jake Busey and Dominique Swain would waste their time working on such nonsense. Bad acting, poor effects, silly dialogue, and a totally improbable scenario here."
1,"Much to my chagrin, my new HP s7320n desktop computer began locking up as soon as I connected this printer to it. After two working days of diagnostics, restarts, and even taking the computer back to where I bought it for an exchange, an arcane service bulletin said that this printer is not compatible with this computer.A sign of how far down HP has slid...an HP printer (which is otherwise a pretty good printer) that is not compatible with an HP computer.Seriously.So, before you buy one of these, make sure it will work with your HP computer..."
1,"Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad. Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge. Seems there's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge. I've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge. Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times, power cycle, and even sent new cartridges. Analyst at HP very nice, thought... still the display flashes ""Color Cartridge Failed"" and ""Replace Color Cartridge"". Won't even print B&W. Dumb thing..."
2,"This toy is sooo cool!When you think of an item in your head and answer yes,no,unknown,or sometimes it eventually figures it out!I was playing it for an 1 hour and it got it right every time.It's amazing how it figures it out and it's great time consuming toy for travel and stuff."
1,"Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days."
2,"It's a good movie. When I saw previews, I thought it would be stupid and a waste. But it wasn't. Well, I've seen better movies, but this is pretty good. I say you should rent it."
1,"I bought this to keep the inside of my RV from freezing up during the week (we use it on weekends). After a power-outage of about 30 minutes, the unit failed to come back on so everything froze up. Since we are prone to brief outages, this was not acceptable. I replaced the Delonghi with a $20 space-heater and have not had another problem."
1,"I purchased this product and the DVD's don't even work. I can't even use them. I get nothing,no picture,nothing."
2,"Absolutely charming book, great for all grade levels. I usually run for the gory, werewolfie or anne boleynesque books, but it was refreshing to pick up something sweet AND interesting for a change. Buy this for the MG reader in your life, but read it for yourself first!"
1,"The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge."
1,"You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes."
2,"Pastor Mark gives us exactly what the title of this book implies. This is a devotional, but it reads more like a series of true mini-sermons that present biblical truths as well as practical applications of the subject matter. Many of the devotionals have a relevant story with them, and they all turn your focus back to the Bible. In a day and age when things aren't so hopeful, this is a blessing from God that really delivers what the title promises. Highly recommended!"
2,"Brought back so many wonderful memories of Christmas past!! Wonderful music and singing, top notch! Children love this, and so do grown-ups!! ""This is my box, this is my box, I never travel without my box."" :)"
2,For great advice on what to expect when you work with a executive recuiter read chapters 7-10. Its worth the price of the book alone. Out of work high-level executives and those who want to make a solid change in their career need to read this book in order to sound smart and learn what to expect from good and bad headhunters.
2,"I have seen all 4 Batman films prior to this one and this one BLOWS ALL OF THEM AWAY (even the still classic 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson)!Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating! I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an ""Adam West"" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" by Joel Schumacher! Otherwise, I'd skip this one because that style of Bats doesn't live here! For everyone else, get ready for great ride! :D"
1,I bought this book because my 8 year old daughter wants to be a VET. She actually did enjoy the book but she also finished it in under 10 minutes. There is almost no text in the book it's mostly pictures with a sentence or two at most.This book reads a lot more like a free brochure you pick up a kids fair rather then an $8 book. For what you get I would say this book should be free.
1,This game looked great on the box and that is all I got out of it.Due yourself a favor and check to make sure your system can handle a game of this high speed and graphics.Called the game company waste of time then checked with my computer manufactor another waste of time.If you think you got a old system then stay away from this game unless your looking to waste a day trying to install and it will never happen.
2,"Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."
1,"Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
1,"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
2,I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it
2,"I LOVE CHUCKS. Have them in many colors and styles! Have been buying them for years, and know what to expect. Sizing differences can be handled if you pick one size, usually one half a shoe size for tie ups, and one shoe size for slip ons."
1,"i like everything aphex twin has ever made (with the exception of ""elephant song""), but this album is a piece of poo covered crust (thats right ""crust""!). i think mr. smiley here is just releasing the stupidest stuff he's ever made as some sort of artsy fartsy nut chunk because these songs stink flamboyantly. the first song features a reggae ""artist"" who has too much self esteem (if your gonna get excited about something dont make it reggae lyrics). anyway i hate lyrics, so i'm a little biased. the other parts in the song consist of drums...and some other insignificant effects. the other songs consist of only the latter; no music just stuff (which i know is arguably music also, but jeez 9 minutes then the next song is the exact same stuff). now i've gone and soiled myself i hope smiley mcgee is happy."
1,"The Bottom Line:Repeating the formula of the moderately-better ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise."
1,first of all Clay Aiken has a decent Voice but make no mistake about it Ruben clearly was the Man Vocally of the two.Clay has this Safe run of the mill Material which He shouldn't be doing so soon.but then again considering what Rod Stewart has been doing with His Last two Projects then I think Clay should have done that instead.Rod needs these Songs&Clay needs to do what Rod is doing.nothing on here has Knock Out written on it.very Bland&dry.Clay deserves better than this.
2,"Was hesitant to purchase because of the price. I was not expecting such quality for the price. I am very very pleased with the fit. It came with a matching shawl and satin straps that I can attach to the dress myself, which I thought was nice because I don't really feel comfortable wearing strapless dresses. I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion. I was pleasantly pleased with all of them. They all fit well. I purchased Mediums (my measurements are 34-29-41, pear-shaped) and this dress flatters my figure. I will be purchasing others. I found that the dresses fit according to the sizing chart that is one of the pictures shown."
2,"Can not beat this item for the price, hands down!Excellent product with all the features you could want, period."
2,"As the author of [...] I recommend Your Child's Self-Esteem with all my heart.Until my book was out I told my clients, readers and workshop participants to read Briggs book. Although I treat tantrums differently, I find most of what Briggs said over 30 years agostill in line with my own guidance. She was way ahead of her timeand for the most part the book will give you everything you needto know about your child's self-esteem and more."
1,"This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
2,If you have Reiki or even if you don't - and just want to come up with a self healing practice - this book is really great. It goes over energy healing and moving Ki - before ever starting on another person. The breathing techniques alone have refined and enpowered my Reiki. The Western tradition has lost something in the translation and this book has filled in some of the gaps.
2,"Candide, is a satire, irony, sarcasm and hyperbole. In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it."
2,Talk about reviewing our roots. I'm the same age as Tom and from S.D. so it was a pleasure to revisit my childhood.
2,"My son loves the video game Halo, and when I found these books, I thought that maybe they would get him to read. Well was I completely CORRECT!! He loves the books. In one day he read about 40 pages. That usually takes him a week to do. I recommend these books to any kids that love that video game. My son is 14 and is really enjoying them."
2,The size of the book provides a fast and convenient reference to muscle anatomy. Its valuable to have.
2,"I ordered this air mattress because I have a bad back and was getting another procedure done and needed a place to recover. We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well. I can think of many reasons why this would be a purchase that is more than worth it for people of all ages (I am in my forties)."
1,"This is the kind of record that gives jazz a bad name. Russell Gunn, a young trumpeter of note, here offers a set of mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given a fresh reading. Instead, what we get is esoteric, virtuoso, insider treatments. Yes, there are some stunning moments, yes, the fine assemblage of 20- and 30-something jazzers play their butts off, but it generally comes across as cold and academic: ideosyncratic, listener-unfriendly set-pieces. Where's the warmth, the vitality, the craziness that make jazz such a surprizing and engaging music? Not here on this disc, I'm sorry to say."
1,"The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."
2,"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives."
2,"This is a great MP3 player, and costs a lot less than an Apple equivalent. Shipping was fast. In case you want to sync some tracks from your computer to the Sansa View, connect it to your computer and call SanDisk support and they will ""activate"" the player remotely and you will be able to sync ever after. I downloaded to user manual. It is much more detailed than the skippy little guide that comes with the player. All in all I am very happy with this player."
1,Product recieved doesn't look nothing like the photo shown. It's full nylon and the quick link doesn't even fit on the chain. It doesn't even come close to fitting.
1,Tivo is a big rip-off. I purchased a TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80-Hour Dual-Tuner on line and hooked it up for 1 month at $9.95 and after a week I found it could only record 1 channel at a time so I called and canceled it. So for that one-week they charged me $109.50 and said it was an early termination fee. Even the Cable Company is not that bad beware of the moneygrubbers. Get you DVR from your cable or sat provider their Dual tuners are real dual tuners not pretend tuners.
2,this book works great for teaching the song. The hardback cover is great for multiple uses.
2,"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
2,"A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)"
1,"It is an average action movie. People that give it 5 starssubmit to mass hypnosis. Fight scenes are very choppy andugly shot - Chris Nolan could learn a thing or two frommovies like ""Hard-Boiled"" or even ""Kungfu Hustle"".Dialog is juvenile and boring. Parts of the plot areutterly ridiculous - as a boy Batman was scared of bats sonow he travels to Tibet to confront his fears. Cinematographyis pretty good - that and few SFX saves that movie - otherwiseit is pretty empty shell of action movie."
2,"I had a Terk indoor/outdoor antenna installed previously. It pulled in most of the available HD channels, but not all of them. I put it in my attic and got the same performance. I set this one up in my living room and it pulls in all of them. And the closer it is to a window the better it works. It's an eye soar sitting here though. I want to see how it works in the attic, but haven't gotten around to getting up there in the summer heat. Since it pulls in signals through windows I don't know if it will work well behind a roof. It's too unsightly in the living room, so if it doesn't work in a hidden spot, I won't continue to use it."
1,"The diapers design has a big flaw and when we tie him up, those ties ups are of plastic and very think causing rash to infant son's weights. I hate these diapers... Thanks."
2,"All right, I do admit a like for the first four, but this one knocks them all out of the running. This is how Batman was meant to be seen. It is the closest thing to the dark cartoon series, and the comics, I have seen. The size is giagantic, and makes you feel surrounded as you watch. Christian Bale is perfect for this role, he has an underlying tension, that makes all of his characters verge on psychotic, and a few actually were, but for Batman, it was perfect. The ability to get so many well known names to come across as these characters believably is wonderful, and makes you care about all aspects of Gotham City. As long as Chris (Nolan) stays on this same wave length with the rest, Batman will never die."
1,"Don't belive the hype. 2 good tracks, one being the single Bridge Over Troubled Water. He is so talented but this cd is baaad. What happened? I loved him on the show, but the song choices are lame to say the least. Maybe the next one will be better. Better to burn than to buy this one."
2,"This is a great shoo rack. It organizes my cluttered shoes and with its revolving functionality, I can easily find my shoes whenever I need them."
2,"I had already got about four different versions of the Goldberg Variations - it's my favourite piece of music.But then I heard this CD played on the radio - and I knew I had to have it! The transcription for string ensemble is flawlessly done. The sheer quality of the sound is astounding - hear the last variation, for example.It really brings out the best in this magnificent composition by Bach. I really recommend it."
1,What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
1,"I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee."
2,"This is the second in the Tempe series, and it was not quite as good as the first. The story line tying where she worked in the winter to where she worked in the summer was just too coincidental for my taste. Made it unbelievable. But her forensic writing was still on top. Nobody does that better. No gratuitous gore! Overall, still a good read."
2,"What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Well-crafted songs with clever lyrics and talented musicianship make for a 50-minute delight. ""At the Bottom of the Sea"" has clever word-play, ""Surfin' in My Imagination"" has some fine surf guitar and inspires some uninhibited dancing, and a great rendition of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" should have you singing in no time with your child. Each song is worth hearing over and over (and over), and this CD is money well spent. My son laughs and laughs at Eighteen Wheels on a Big Rig,"" and I am partial to and extremely appreciative of ""The Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song)."" After all, four bananas make a bunch and so do many more!I am incredibly impressed with Ralph Covert's abilities to reach a child's imagination without shutting out the adults. I am going to buy this as a gift to all parents I know, and I also plan to purchase Ralph's World's first CD. This CD should be at the top of anyone's Wish List."
1,"I had the honor of reading this book in my 9th grade Advanced English class and while I am an avid reader and love all different types of literature this book still makes me cringe when I see it on summer reading list.While I've read review and I wish I read what they read because it seems like a very good book, but I could not make it through this book to save me. It was 10years ago I had to read this book and I often wonder if I picked it up today would it make any sense? But out of all the books I read throughout highschool and College this book is tedious and very difficult to read.Even with a tutor and note taking I still did not pass the exams that were related to this book."
2,"We bought this rise cooker to replace our old one and were a bit disappointed. First of all this devise takes much more time to cook and there are too many settings for us, you have to know the exact kind of rice you got in order to make it perfect. But when you do know it makes the best rice!"
1,"I LOVED the iSkin for the first 2 months. Then, it stretches, bubbles over the keys, and doesn't give a good fit. I'm very disappointed. The Apple Store has returned mine a couple of times now and have deduced it just gets heated and stretches. They will take it back now and offer a store credit. I would love a skin that works."
1,"Is there anything worse than to be up at 5am with your infant, waiting for your morning coffee to brew only to find it all over the counter, cabinets and floor! What's worse than having to clean an enormous, scalding hot mess?--> Having to do it first thing in the morning before your coffee!!!I've owned this coffee maker for a year.... Found out about this 'little' design flaw early on. I know how to align and check everything and this still periodically happens. Nearly every time we have houseguests, if someone else makes the coffee, it happens to them...poor things. Anyhow, there's gotta be a better machine out there and I will find it..I'm not drinking my a.m. coffee at 3pm so this machine is NOT WORTH THE GIGANTIC pain in the a$$ of cleaning the mess!"
2,"Great fun. Cher really shines in this movie, plays a great average woman. Not to mention nicholas cage is such anAdorable wako in this movie u just can't help but love him."
2,Seventh Generation wipes never cause allergic reactions in my children's sensative skin. The price is excellent and the delivery time was spot on! I will certainly continue my subscription for this product.
1,"[..]Let me warn all potential customers that this book is all about quantity of material instead of quality. While the book does cover such advanced topics as Fourier Analysis and intro to Partial Differential Equations, the book lacks sufficient examples about what is being said (a number of sections have no examples at all).I did find the most well-written sections to be the application of second-order differential equations (applied to spring oscillations etc.) However, as far as getting a bang for your buck, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Morris Tennenbaum and Harry Polland's Ordinary Differential Equations Dover edition (cheaper, and MUCH MORE effective. Trust me)."
2,"A sad tale for anyone to read - for a feminist like myself, it was heartbreaking. A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy."
1,I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
2,"This was a hard one to put down. In vivid but tight language, the story of the Essex is gripping and the details of the culture of whaling and the hard life at sea are intriguing and informative. In the end we get to see how religion, social position and greed play together to tell the grim sort of story we rarely acknowledge as part of our American history. Well worth the time and suitable for non-historians for its high adventure. It made me want a big steak."
1,"The first few chapters were original in content and writing style. I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high ""original"" adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much."
2,"This is an excellent film, with more twists and turns in the plot than a snake in a pretzel factory. Highly recommended!"
2,I am 26 years old and I have been a fan of Depeche Mode since I was about 10 years old. I remember listening to this tape with my sister in her room and thinking how great this band is. I still love their music. I listen to them every day. I have all their CDs and I got to see them in concert during there Exciter tour. I guarantee that you will fall in love with Depeche Mode and appreciate their talents and Martin Gore's song writing skills.
1,"My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough."
1,"You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product. This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair, so beware."
2,"WOOOOOOWWWWWWW. This is THE PERFECT BABY MAKING ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS THE BEST ARTIST AND MUSICIAN OF ALL TIME. HE MAKING HIT ALBUM AFTER HIT ALBUM. And TP-2.COM is THE BEST R&B;/SOUL ALBUM EVER MAKE. It has what every person needs in his life SATISFACTION. THIS ALBUM MAKES ME FORGET OF ALL PROBLEMS OF LIFE. Also makes Me feel more strong and passionate person. I don`t know why it has the ""Parental Advisory"" sign, IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING. ALL the 19 Songs are the BEST I HEARD IN MY LIFE, LISTEN CAREFULLY...IT`S MAGICAL MUSIC BY THE R&B; KING. A UNBELIEVABLE, PHENOMENAL CLASSIC.EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THIS MASTERPIECE...ESPECIALLY TRUE LOVERS.THE BEST SLOW JAMMING ALBUM OF ALL TIME. BUY 3 COPIES OF IT !!!"
2,"I always get size 4 for my little guy, and so I ordered size 4 in Pampers Baby-Dry. I can barely fit them around his waist. My friend and I compared Pampers size 3 and 4 next to each other and we couldn't tell any size difference."
1,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
2,Just read this book for the first time as a 40 something yr old and wow. This is what a classic is suppose to be. Thanks John Steinbeck.
1,"The first one we received was dead out of the box. It made a loud grinding and sounded like a fan hitting metal. We assumed this was due to shipping damage and received a replacement. The replacement worked fine for six months but suddenly the display panel would go blank and the clock would reset after a few minutes. The microwave has now ceased functioning altogether. The warranty states ""in-home"" service, but there are no local service facilities."
1,"I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice."
2,"The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. I loved following the budding romance."
2,"I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
2,"after five awesome years of owning toxicity i still consider this to be one of my favorite cds. i also find that other people who usually cant stand metal/hard rock have enjoyed alot of the songs on this cd, especially songs like ""bounce"" and ""prison song"" which are very fun and catchy. If you listen to the radio you have probably already heard some of the best songs on this album like: ""Needles"", ""chop suey"", ""toxicity"", and ""aerials"" which are all very good. Toxicity as a whole is very easy to listen thru entirely without really getting bored. and unlike the radio version of aerials the cd version has a 1:30 ending of indian chanting with flute which is kind of wierd... but interesting! so before buying any other s.o.a.d. cds i highly sugest toxicity first. its the most original, most enjoyable, and most unique metal album i have ever heard."
2,"The Beta Band was such a refreshing discovery for me ina time when I feel like sounding the death knell of rock and roll. Don't ask anyone to pigeonhole this band. It can't be done, as they truly have an eclectic style. It is risky to put such a catchy, brilliant song at the beginning of a CD the way they've done with ""Dry the Rain"" and then have more exploratory stuff for the duration, but the Beta Band has pulled this off nicely! The rhythms and instrumentation are fantastic and unusual. I can't recommend this highly enough to the both the weekend music fan and also to the connosieur of good music! This is catchy yet complex, accessible yet original. END END"
1,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old. When I first got the package, I noticed that the plastic covering was torn. This should have been my first clue. The product was NOT what the picture is. Infact, it's a cheaper one that costs 10$ less. I got the Mega 2 play land. I found it at Toys R US for 47$. The balls that were supposed to come with the play set were opened and had hair on them. The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily. Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it. I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order. The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily. Overall this product sucks. I'm sending it back tomorrow ( i got it today). I will be ordering a different brand all together from Toys R Us. The tunnels don't even connect right...there are big holes where they attach. disappointed....."
1,"It's a blatant ripoff of Predators and not even a good one at that. It has the feel of a movie made in someone's backyard. I feel bad for Sorbo and Woodbine. They once had careers, but now they're doing homemade movies for some Garcia kid down the street."
2,"I never make a pie or pastry crust using anyone else's recipe. I know it won't be as good, so I just don't do it. I always use one from this book. That way, there's no anxiety. I know with certainty the crust will be perfect."
1,This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down.
1,"I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
1,I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
1,"Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
1,"I fell in love with these great dishes but I am dissapointed that they need to be replaced within a few years. They were our wedding set and I wish they didn't look awful. We only use them for family meals and use my husband's everyday Johnson Bros. dishes that are 50 years old! They look great. Too Bad the quality isn't like it used to be... unless we just got a ""bad batch"" although they were purchased from different stores where we registered... Nice to set the table with but will scratch unless your family uses plastic tableware. We don't."
2,"My baby is 2 years old and I have tried just about every diaper on the market. Pampers Baby Dry are, by far, my favorite. This is also a great value on Amazon especially if you sign up for regular delivery and get the discount."
1,"I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal."
1,"I have ordered this DVD four times. Picture is fine, music is fine, subtitles are fine BUT none of the received DVD has french dialogs/ actors' voices. Does somebody else have the same experience??Steve"
2,"Ms Too has tackled a subject that is immensely difficult to learn. However, I thought her approach and explaination was excellent. Readers, please be patient and reread each section more than once.Again, advance Feng Shui puts alot of people in despair due to the topic but once you master the knowledge, the wisdom and flow will pour forth clearly."
1,"I spent 3 weeks burning both the warts with wart stick. I used it to the point where it nearly started bleeding, still no result, warts still grew back. Used the freezing method, got rid it of it in one application. Much better, cleaner, and surprisingly, less painful."
1,Who ever wants a piece of me will have to tell me so on this web page and thats the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so
2,"My kids ages 4 and 6 love these books. The rhyming and story line are perfect for their age, well written, nice pictures. We read them over and over again, a perfect before bedtime book."
1,This had no impact whatsoever on my warts. I was concerned that one of my children would think it was lip balm and accidentally use it on their lips...this didn't happen but I even if it had it certainly wouldn't have hurt as it seemed like wax.
1,"Only about 1 hour long, and most of this is talking. Somewhat interesting, but I wanted Dolby Digital Hendrix!"
1,"I got this toy during the summer of '03 so I could have something to do on a long roadtrip I was going on. I love neopets, and I thought that a pocket neopet, would be similar to the site. Well it's not. It really boring. There is only four games that you can play. Negg Drop, Techno Says, Poogle Races and Fruit Machine. After about 20 minutes I got bored with the games. You can only earn Neopoints(neopets money) for the first couple of times you play. So I decided that I would buy some food and a toy for my neopet. Well there is only like 3 toys you can buy and 3 items of food you can buy. It's pretty boring. There is nothing else that you can really do. I put it in my junk drawer and havent taken it out sense. This is definatly not worth your money!"
1,"I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment)."
1,"Although the CD's themselves are in fair condition the box in which the set came in is terrible, seperating from its backing the plastic tray which holds the CD's could have at least been re-affixed to the card?"
1,"I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."
2,"Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."
2,"Spattered a bit, but did a good job of making rice. Porridge? Do they mean oatmeal? What about cooking macaroni and cheese--no info for that in booklet. Have not tried it for soup."
2,"Excellent book. It was enjoyable and takes you back to Colonial times. Once you get used to the older English, it is an easy read"
2,"I am a big Kaye Gibbons fan, but I found this book to be a little weaker than the rest. The character development (usually a Gibbons strength) was not great. The book rambled a little bit. All that being said, ""mediocre"" Kaye Gibbons writing is still phenomenal by any standard."

2,We've used Pampers Baby Dry for about three months now for our daughter and we really like them. She's never had a problem with them and they hold a lot. She's sleeping about 10 hours at night partly because she is very comfortable and she can last the whole night on just one diaper. It's pretty full when she wakes up but her skin still seems mostly dry.
2,"I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer."
1,"This book started off well and you really got a feel for this wonderful and special older woman who was a healer and the central character. As the book progressed it became a struggle to read because of the other characters and their inter-relationships. It simply never came together for me.I have, however, enjoyed other Kaye Gibbons books."
1,"I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back."
1,"Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. Last two tracks (""Cade Voce"" and ""Words"")are almost noteworthy, but not quite! Save your money on this one unless your a collector. Oh well - maybe next time."
2,My son loved reading this after he watched John Carter the movie. Thank you for making this easily available for him.
1,"What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot. Steinbeck is a pessimist to say the least and I will never read his works again."
1,"I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company. It was to be ""combatable"" to DSL Verizon. Not so said the phone company. You have to by from us, they said. I battled this unit for a month. It changed my IP so many times and would lock up. Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon. One would say, ""Its the phone company's problem"", then the phone company would say, ""Its the modem company's problem"". I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system. It works great. Buyer beware. It does not work as advertised."
1,BUYER BEWARE ! ! !YES THE DIAPERS ARE GOOD BUT I RECEIVED THE DIAPERS WITH STAINS THEY LOOK LIKE DNA STAINS. SO I CALL THE COMPANY AND THEY INSTRUCT ME TO TROW THEM AWAY ALL 200 DIAPERS WOW. SO I WAIT IN THE MAIL FOR SOME COUPONS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME AND TURNS OUT I HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN ORDER TO GET THE DIAPERS I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. SO I CALL COMPANY AGAIN AND THEY SEND ME MORE COUPONS TO REPLACE THE DIAPERS SO WHEN THE COUPONS GET HERE ITS ONLY ENOUGH COUPON TO PURCHASE 100 DIAPERS WOW THEY SCREWED ME FOR 100 DIAPERS SO I CALL THEM BACK AND THEY ASKED ME TO SHIP THEM BACK THE COUPONS SO THEY CAN SEND ME MORE COUPONS OK FINE ILL DO IT. SO I GO TO THE STORE TODAY AND I TRY TO GET REDEEM THE COUPON FOR THE DIAPERS I ALREADY PAID FOR AND NOW I AM FORCED TAXES FOR THE DIAPERS I ALREADY PAID FOR MY TAXES AND AM FORCED TO PAY AGAIN FOR WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR . .BAD BAD BAD EXP I AM SORRY I HAVE TO GO THRU ALL OF THIS VERY DEPRESSING . .
2,"""Of Mice and Men,"" is a gripping story about two men who are wondering through life, from dead end job to dead end job, with only each other to rely on. George, a bright man and clearly the leader of the two, and Lennie, as the book puts it ""a gentle giant,"" dream of a simple life of one day owning their own land. In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action. One almost becomes the third stooge in the story. Each chapter builds upon the suspense, ultimately culminating in an ending that does not disappoint!"
1,"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."
1,The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.
2,"I could go on and on about the various aspects of quality in this film...I will leave that for other reviewer's of this film. I would just like to add it is a beautiful masterpiece, complete in every way. An experience of old cold war Czechoslovakian lovers...there is tension, sadness, love scenes of high taste and quality throughout the film. Even a special few minutes when every woman watching the sequence on screen, would probably be a lesbian for the day. Its not about sex...its all about living a full life and loving someone deeply...buy this film and sit back and enjoy it...bring a handkerchief along for the ending."
2,"If you're looking for good insights on criminal behaviour, this is it. I liked it and learned a few things I hadn't already explored."
2,"This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time."
2,"I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing, trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone!"
1,"I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!"
1,If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. I turned it off after 5 tracks because I couldn't bare to listen to it any more. I had the feeling that someone had rummaged through some old discarded session tapes and had played them back through a pillow. The arrangements were definitely not what I was expecting and the quality was awful. I gave this recoding 1 star but only because they wouldn't let me out of the screen without filling in that field!
2,"What a phenomenal job they did with this movie! I loved the other films too but what a fantastic fresh start for a new series of Batman movies! This is the Batman film that we were waiting for! Everything about this movie was amazing! The cast, the sets, the characters, the soundtrack! The musical score by James Newton Howard (KING KONG) and Hans Zimmer is so intense! It's awesome! Everything about this movie is amazing! I am already looking forward to the sequels! I hope that there are many to follow! Christian Bale was an excellent choice for the title character! I am a huge fan of his work now! Would love to see Harley Quinn and the Joker team up! And if it's done with the excellence of Nolan, hopefully she will be introduced in one sequel then reek havoc in the following. Just an idea. BATMAN BEGINS is excellent! A must own!"
1,"It's *another* King of Fighters game. Don't we already have enough of these already? It's not like this one is drastically different from the other ones.It's basically the same game as all the other King of Fighters but with a 2006 date attached to the title name, which means people will notice it, realize it's brand new, and buy it immediately. Why do we continue to be tormented like this? In a world already loaded with more than enough tournament fighters, I have just this to say- FIND SOMETHING ELSE."
2,"This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it."
1,"This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."
2,"WOW, that is all i can say! This is the best CD I have ever heard, and I am 16 so i have heard a lot of different music. But ever since I saw Clay on American Idol, I fell inlove with him. I still don't know how Ruben won, but Clay certainly has what it takes to be on the top! So again, WOW! You must buy this CD!"
1,One of the blurbs on the cover said 'The Daughter of Time' was the best mystery ever written. I seldom give up on a book but this is one that I discarded about a fourth of the way into.Save your money.
2,"If you have a tivo and haven't gotten Wi-fi, I highly recommend doing so with this adapter. Particularly, if like me you had one that didn't sit near a telephone line. It was easy to set up and works well even though my second Tivo is three rooms away from my computer/wireless router. Besides avoiding the problem of having to string a phone line once a week to make sure your tivo doesn't run out of programming info, it also ensures you're able to fully use of all of the available features - including scheduling recordings from any computer when you're away from home."
1,"The printer worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the paper feed mechanism suddenly stopped picking up the paper. I found that I could print single sheets if I shoved a piece of paper in at just the right moment. Too early and I would get a paper jam, too late and I would get an ""out of paper"" message.This issue afflicts a good number of HP inkjet printers. So many, in fact, that HP created a help page just for it: [...]Customer service is sending out a ""printer cleaning kit"", a.k.a. a mechanical band-aid for whatever design flaw they couldn't fix on schedule."
1,i liked her first book witch : a magickal journey alot. she took a chapter out of witch: a magickal journey also titled 7 days to a magickal new you added a few new things and made it into this book. save your money and just get her first book it has the same material as this plus tons more and if you already have her first one don't even bother with this. it's a cute idea but it looks way too much like she was just trying to make a quick buck reproducing old material.
1,"This is war as seen from the Allies side, with hardly any references or researches on the Central Powers. Hardly impartial historical writing. And boring too."
2,"This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an ""Adam Smith"" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title."
2,"Pompeii is an excellent CD. The music is in the vein of ""Old Loves Die Hard."" This CD, however, is a bit lighter overall and even more prominently features B. Palmer's somewhat flowerly yet pleasant vocals.In my view, the 2002 re-master of this CD is just plain poor. The bass is too heavy and dull, and the sound lacks brightness. Increasing the treble, manually, will help the music to shine. Also, the bonus track is merely an edited version of the last tune on the CD, so its inclusion is hardly of value."
1,"Allow me to summarize this film for you.A self-centered, rude and unlikeable Morrissey fan licks Morrissey posters and basically deludes herself into believing that she is going to marry him.I understand that the film is intended to be funny and over-the-top, but the humor is merely vulgar and mean spirited.Before someone accuses me of simply not like Morrissey or of being a victim of Hollywood formula, let it be known that I am both a huge Smiths/Morrissey fan and an admirer of independent films. Despite these facts, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any aspect of this film."
2,IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.
2,"Please send me Cake Craft & Decoration, begin by March 2006 issue.ThanksDiana"
2,"Summer of my german soldier is an exallent book. I read it at age 13, and it was a page turner. I would definatly recomend it. You get a slight history lesson, but not too much. I wont ever forget Anton and Patty!"
1,"do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
1,"This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best."
2,"Our class had to read this book as part of the curriculum... and I am so glad we did! This classic deserves the attention it has gotten the past (almost) 100 years! Read this book!Of Mice and Men is about a retarded man named Lennie and the man who travels and protects him, George, and their journey to work on a ranch during the Great Depression.All of the characters in this book were complex and marvelous... even the ones who had less than 5 lines!George- The man who gave up his happiness to help and love Lennie.Lennie- A strong man with the mind of a toddler. He will do anything to make George happy.Curley- He hates Lennie because he is intimidated by men who are bigger than him.Curley's Wife- She flirts with every man on the ranch to make up for the loneliness Curley gives her.This book was written amazingly... obviously, it's a classic! Even though it was written in the early 20th century, it is easy to comprehend if you are at least 12."
1,"Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."
2,I bought this for our whole house stereo speakers (7 different rooms plus our back patio). It works really well and creates less heat in the cabinet then our older version of this amp.
1,"Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans."
2,"The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed."
2,I saw this movie in the theater and wanted it for my iPad to see over and over again. Amazon is the best way to go to purchase online videos. I highly recommend this movie and appreciate Amazon.
2,Ransom by far is my favorite of all Julie Garwood's Scottish series. She uses Broderick as the main character and his personality matches Gillian's perfectly. I was happy to revisit the characters of Judith and Iain again.
2,"I know the members of the band and they're some of the greatest people out there and they're music is to match. William Goldsmith's drumming is amazing and his energy is not to be beat. Anyone who says that they're too quiet don't know anything about quality. This is quality few ever hear in music.They are talented and emotional and willing to experiment. More experiments with intense, emotional music will be on the next album. If you like this, check out Diary and the Pink Album."
1,"Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here."
2,"When i first played the game halo i loved it. The gameplay was great music was beutifully done and supprisingly the story was expertly told.So when a halo book came out i jumped on it to see the back round of the story. And behold it turned out great. But its no literary master piece. To compare it, its like reading a Tom Clancy novel. The author seems to have a technical name for just about every piece of equipment.So to round this review up if you like halo pick up the boxs set but be warned the series is written by two author and you may feel a chnge of writting inbetween the books, but its still all good."
1,"Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing."
1,"As an Independant Consultant and Solution Provider, Small Business Server was an ideal candidate to add to our arsenal services being offered to our small business owners. To support it we would need some quality technical resources available to us to continue to provide high quality support and I was hoping the Resource Kit would do it. I was complete let down by it's lack of in-depth technical information and seemingly lack of direction. It is nothing more than a product overview. Thumbs down on this one!"
1,"I just wanted to point out that a lot of these reviews are fake, probably from the publisher. How do I know this? Because people from Laguna Beach, California do not spell favorite like ""favourite"". Try harder next time publisher."
1,Not Worked on my baby.... he drinks plenty of water.. so obviously tooks more diapers at night times...i was keep on changings 2 or 3 times every night ...it didnt set for babies who takes plenty of water
2,"This little hot plate does keep my tea warm. The only negative is that the on/off switch is very close to the hot plate surface. and if you're not careful, you'll get burned."
1,"I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult."
2,I bought this warmer hoping it would get hotter than a candle warmer and it does. Keeps coffee perfectly hot. I highly recommend it.
2,"This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is."
2,I was shocked at how quickly and easily I was able to set this up. It literally took five minutes. I can't believe I waited this long to get my tivos on my home network. Highly recommend!
2,"Though the Carlyle glassware is currently out of stock, I decided to write a review assuming they'll be back. I bought these glasses over a year ago after noticing that I was down to mismatched glasses in the cabinet that I didn't like much.After looking around the store, I decided on these. Generally, I like to buy glasses at a physical store because of the ""touch"" factor. Each of the exterior widening ""steps"" in the design helps keep the glass from slipping from one's grasp. Simple, but very cool idea that looks good too. It's been great for kids (runs in the family). They come out of the dishwasher looking great. I also like the idea that this is an old design from the 1930's.Finally, maybe the best thing; they're tough, and don't break when you'd expect. We've accidentally knocked them off a side table onto our marble floor too many times and are always amazed that they're in one piece.These are great for everyday use and I highly recommend them."
2,"Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died. The grand father skipped over his son (a fat gross slob) to give Steve the medallion and the ring of kingship. This set off a war.Gypsies are mostly known for their grift, scams and cons but when called upon they can fight and kill too. Several attempts are made on his life but he survives. Read this book and see what happens.Steve tells author Peter Maas that he wants to change and he wants to change the way the gypsies live. The book ends there and we do not know if he was successful. The book is very very short. You can read it almost in 1 sitting. Some of the reviews are longer than the book.bbp okc ok2009"
1,"To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."
1,"Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."
2,"this book is very good, I couldn't put it down. the whole book was perfect, it was old fasion."
1,"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
1,"I found the product inadequate. This CD is a collection of children's songs, with some narrative, spoken by a child in Japanese, preceding each song. The weird thing is the narrative is completely unrelated to the song. Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words ""completely random"".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to ""learn"" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised."
2,"Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow."
1,"It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
2,"The book is well written and very interesting. I don't mind reading it unlike other textbooks. Was a little nervous about it not getting it in the mail before my class started, but it did get shipped and delivered right on time."
2,"These are simply gorgeous and they feel like a high end product, very high quality! Beautiful lace! I love these thigh highs hosiery!"
1,I bought this pendant because was nice in the picture and also had a 50% discount but in reality looks very cheap the chain is very thin and fragile...
2,"My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon."
1,"I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."
2,"These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded, next to your bed in case the power goes out, toss them in the pool, the tub, the punchbowl,the fun ideas with these things are endless. Incidentally, these work just the same as all the other ""Waterless"" drink coolers that we've had since long before the ""lighted"" ones arrived on the scene. Why-ever would you ""throw them out"" just because the light was done??"
2,"Really nice CD for a general overview of Pete Seeger's music through the years. I'm still looking for a CD that has the music from the DVD ""Power of Song"" on it. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.Ann Louise Ramsey"
1,"I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless."
2,"I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!"
2,"We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
2,"I asked for this cd for my birthday only knowing one song on it, ""Learning to Fly"" and I simply fell in love with the cd. The songs are wonderfully sang and written. The words really witness to you. ""Grand Scheme"" is among another of my favorites. All the songs are great. I recomend this cd highly to you if you like 4Him."
2,"I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
1,"The title of this item says ""(3 books boxed set..."" however, when I purchased and received this item, I was only sent one book. I was expecting three books, especially for the price that I paid, and was only sent one. Therefore, I am rating this item very poorly."

1,"If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"This collection of short stories is destined to be a classic and a ""must-have"" for people everywhere. Take a look at yourself and at your fellow man. This book is great from cover to cover."
2,"This book is one of the most comprehensive books on the 1911. If you want to know anything about the 1911, this book (along with Vol. 2) is the best source of information."
1,"Good sequal to ""Patton"". Worthy addition to the original. The quality of the dvd however leaves alot to be desired. My copy looks like a copy made from a VHS tape. But, for 1 cent & shipping I guess I can't complain."
2,"Chilling especially given how powerful the media has become in our current society. Orwell was brilliant, and in this book, he is able to identify the critical elements of a democratic society that we often just take for granted."
2,"It includes lots of up-to-date knots. You can find the knots you want in a easy way. Also, the knots are categorized by the uses of them by which you can find the common usage of those knots. Easy to use."
1,"Or this is catalouge book and nothing more.If some buy Lodge cast iron pot or pan,must have this book free of cost."
2,got the dvd on time and we enjoyed it and it was good. clark and all the gang are so great.
1,"the book is simple and makes the tough parts of econometrics understandable.however some core background topics are lacking... statistical depth for persons without a solid background in statistics. such is found in other texts(see jonston, gujurati, koutsoyannis, intrilligator).furthermore the book assumes prior knowledge of matrices,hence those without a solid background herein,at left at a loss."
1,Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series.
1,"i wish I could give this book no stars.I would have to strongly disagree that Steve Berry did a good job of researching this book. Steve Berry does not know the difference between doctrine and rule or excommunication and censure. As a fallen-away Catholic, he probably did his research by listening to the lies and misconceptions promulgated in anti-Catholic websites and chat rooms. It is very clear that Steve Berry has major conflicts with the doctrine and rules of the Catholic Church and justifies his leaving the Church by writing about how horrible and evil it is.I was unable to go through much of the book because of the overwhelming anti-Catholic bias. This novel is just one more of the many novels that will be used by anti-Catholic bigots in their attacks on Catholics and Catholicism. Don't spend your money on this garbage."
2,This is one of the best I have seen. Side splitting funny. Will watch over and over.
1,"I WISH I had read the previous review for this book before I bought it. I couldn't put it better myself. I bought this book because it was the only one advertising saturated fat counts. I already have two books that cover everything but saturated fat, and I'm going to keep it that way. I'm returning this book for a refund."
1,"I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
1,"I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also."
2,"Clay and his songs have to be the best of the best that we have had in YEARS. I can even listen to music now with my children and grandchildren listening and don't feel ashamed. Clay Aiken is truly a breath of fresh air, a new lease on life and we all should be PROUD that finally, a true , non-tattoed, non woman chasing,non drug taking & non sex addict , nice young AWESOME Artist that really cares about people but still has that shy sex appeal and morals has emerged!!! THANK THE LORD!! IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!!CLAY, YOU DID THE WORLD AND RCA PROUD AND THANK YOU RCA FORRECOGNIZING THIS AND PUTTING HIM ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST!!!!!His mother Faye and his grandmother are to be commended!!!HE IS WHAT THE ""MEASURE OF A MAN"" STANDS FOR!!!"
1,"I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."
2,"Mr. Southall has provided an excellent reference book for both the professional and amateur ghost hunter / paranormal investigator! In this book, terms and definitions are explained in easy to understand language...the author doesn't need to use ""big words"" to make himself appear intelligent. It is very clear that immense amounts of thought, effort and experience went into this book. Most definately a must-have!!!"
2,"This product is just what I expected, minus the fact that due to being white, you can easily see my nipples through the shirt. I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts, but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue. The transparency of these white shirts, combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt, so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run. Minus one star for shame."
2,I needed this book for a paper I was writing about redheads and this book turned out to be an excellent book. It is very interesting and has a lot of good stuff in it.
2,"While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its ""Thriller"" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old ""haunted house"". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park ""fun house"" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind."
2,have you read? Its the book everyone is reading now. It shows what its like to live in a totalagrarian society like Nazi Germany or W. U.S.
2,"I really like Reich's style. The fact that she's a real life forensic anthropoligist gives great credence to her work. I've read all 3 of her books and each is just as interesting as the previous.I hope to read more about her undercover friend in future publications. Just like Kay Scarpetta, she needs a social life!"
1,"The TV Guide called it probably the best horror movie ever made. This was supposed to be a classic? I guess it was a classic con-job. Mia's character, or was it just Mia, was so unbelievable. The whole tale seems so, simplistic? Oh let's not go over for dinner, oh we will, oh it is so ironic Guy's suddenly taken a liking to his neighbors. The 'suggestions' and red-herrings didn't help much in alleviating the pain of a sad non-ending. I would recommend this to film buffs only. For me, at the end of two and a half hours, it felt like nothing much had happened."
1,"The good news is that this coffee maker doubles as a humidifier. Steam shoots out of mine like a 19th century train locomotive. The lack of a proper seal between the filter basket lid and the water reservoir is the culprit.The filter basket and water reservoir are also not separate chambers. This causes steam to rise from the filter basket, hit the lid, and condense as water back into the reservoir. No doubts this is the main factor contributing to the very long brewing process."
2,"Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
2,I bought these as a replacement when our new puppy chewed the end off of a similar type lace on my husband's favorite shoes. They come with easy to follow instructions and after a few minutes all was as good as new and harmony was restored! (shoes are now kept well away from puppy!)
1,"I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."
2,"I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. I really appreciate that the producers put on the DVD season extras, and left the shows 100% complete. No commercial interruptions is such a nice treat. I remember they used to show oodles of commercials between the segments, and cut them up, in syndication.Love it!MC White said: Check it out!"
2,"Do not believe the charges of anti-semitism.This book is critical of both sides but based on exhaustive research into primary sources: the files of the Israeli government and army. If you only want to hear the propaganda from one side or another, avoid this book.I would criticize the maps as inadequate, a detailed map of the region in the endpaper would have been just the thing. Also, the author assumes a familiarity with people and events in the areawhich went well beyond my knowledge, until I read the book.Update: 10 December 2002Wow. I got a ton of ""unhelpful"" votes for the above review. My review was not particularly well written, nor spell checked (now corrected!), nor was it detailed. But 17 out of 85 unhelpful? I wonder, wonder what is going on."
1,"In watching Clay on TV, I was in hopes of great things from him in his first CD. It was VERY vanilla! Nothing spectacular...or stretching. I think he played it safe and I was hoping it sounded a bit better. I won't purchase it. I borrowed the CD from a friend and decided not to buy it. I think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this CD."
2,"Let's face it, most of these books are getting a bad rap. Everything is being compared to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. While certainly and unarguably the best religious thriller around, Steve Berry, no doubt, delivers a first-rate action packed thriller. This will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must read if you are searching for the next best religious mystery!"
2,This scale is great. It is very accurate and is also accurate for repeatability. It's easy to read. It came mostly assembled. I only had to screw 2 parts together.I would highly recommend it for anyone that wants accuracy to a quarter pound.
1,"The Mr. Coffee warmer does not produce enough heat to keep a beverage in a typical coffee mug warm. The wattage should be higher. In addition, earlier models had a somewhat higher wattage and an automatic shutoff if the cup was not lifted from the warmer for a period of time, approximately 10 minutes. When the cup was lifted, the timer would reset. Also, when the cup was lifted, the warmer would shut off until the cup was replaced on the warmer. The current model does not have either of these safety features. Once you turn the warmer on, it stays on until turned off with the manual switch on the warmer (if you remember to turn it off)."
1,"I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
2,"1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends."
1,"Nice and samll but battery died on this replacment headset after 1 month, the first one died after 3 months. The replacment battery is more expensive then the headset inself but I ordered it anyway, the battery was non functioning and now I have 2 junk headsets and one junk battery!!!"
1,"I can run the DVD on a laptop computer, but it will not run on a 2011 DVD player or a 2009 DVD player."
2,"Today is the ""Perfect Day"" - Clay ""Touch""es us with ""The Way"" he sings. He ""Shine""s in this CD. Clay definitely does not disappoint. There's a song on this CD that should appeal to anyone who loves music. Clay is no longer ""Invisible"" - he's a popstar with a wonderful voice and most importantly integrity ....and that's the ""Measure of a Man""."
2,"Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
1,"My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better."
2,"This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends. They have been working together for life, and one day plan to have a little house with crops and animals. They both go to work on another farm, and it seems to be working out for them, so that one day their dream can come true. But then Lennie gets into big trouble that costs two peoples lives and affects many others."
1,"What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
1,"waste of money, do NOT get this, this is poser rip-off rap, at it's worst, c-murder blatanly rips off 2pac rhyming style, the beats are throwaway at best...they stock is crumblin"
2,This is a fantastic book- it was bought as a gift- they also loved it! Hale's photos are really superb!
1,"After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future."
1,I ordered the cleaning kit for a Christmas present. I opened it prior to wrapping it and it was a good thing! The bottles had leaked inside the box and there was a mess. I returned the products to Amazon and received my refund promptly and purchased another item...one that would not leak when shipped!
2,"I found that the Hercules DS510B was beautiful in looks and was stunning. The only flaw I had with it was the bell part of the stand was not easy to fit away in my trumpet case. Other than that, I love it! Would highly recommend it."
1,"I used this printer for a year, it was working fine, and never got paper jam, and working fine with windows XP, and Vista. However margin is notperfect exact. every time when I print my document out margin is always littel different. I printed out same page 10 times every margin of paper is different. it was very annoying meMy toner was out last week, so I got the other printer --Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer (Black)-- I think it is better than this one.it is five dollars cheaper than HP.and spec is higer than HP.brother HL-2070N VS HP1020Print speed: Up to 20 ppm VS 14 ppm A4-size(I used both printer and brother is faster than HP)150-sheetinput capacity : 250 sheet VS 150-sheetMemory: 16 MB VS 2 MBStandard interfaces: Hi-Speed USB 2.0, IEEE-1284 Parallel, 10/100 BaseT Ethernet VS Hi-Speed USB 2.0 portHp is little quite than brother. but it is not big deal for meor You can compare with the other printersbut in my case, the worst thing is the imprecise margin"
2,"From holidays in a Near East country I brought back spices which were contaminated by coakroaches. For over half a year I tried everything to get the roaches out of my house. No remedy helped really and I got desperated in the end. Then I came across ""COMBAT"" and since 2 weeks of using the product the number of insects is going rapidly down. There is hope that COMBAT will destroy the roaches completely."
1,"I have never seen the British version, but we liked the American ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. Series 2 is a disappointment, the action seems contrived, and so do the characters. We couldn't believe a minute of it. If you are a fan of the American version you will probably have to have lowered expectations to enjoy this."
1,"What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35."
1,"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
2,I have purchased many bevel tools and I like this one because it goes further down into thehole and the shape feels better to my hand especially when working out a lot of thumb holesused this product a lot and haven't had to sharpen it yet.
2,"Okay, let's face it, it's all about time and there's just too little of it. With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks. I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch? Statistics prove that fewer people cook from scratch and get bland, pedestrian fast food, with Semi Homemade Cooking anyone can be a ten minute maestro of the kitchen."
2,"Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community."
1,"The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick, not true. It says it has an LED to show when it is charging, not true. It says it is for a PowerBook G4, not true (From the start I had to twist it to get it to tell my computer not charging. it doesn't have the power to charge). I returned the first one to get what was listed but Amazon sent the same thing out. I couldn't be bothered so I just stuck it in the corner.DO NOT GET IT, its too overpriced and doesn't do what it says. PRODUCT INFO IS FALSE!"
1,"Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
1,"I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."
1,"to tell you the truth, i didn't like this book. i am not into the whole ""western"" books. i had to read it for a project at my school and i thought it was terrible. plain and simple. sorry to all you out there who liked it but u guys r weird!"
1,"I received this printer for Christmas. I had it maybe a month and a half and it would not pull the paper. I tried all the recommendations on HP website and it did not help. I ended up contacting HP tech support. They had me do all these resets, etc. which still did not work. They offered a refurbished one for free so I took it. It was like new but again about a month or two later - SAME PROBLEM. Of course, I did not buy extended warranty so I MANUALLY FEED THE PAPER EVERY TIME. It is a great printer otherwise but I recommend NOT TO BUY THIS PRINTER"
2,"I am very pleased with my recent purchase of 4 boxes of Pampers. Delivery was super-fast (and free), faster than I expected. Having twins, this is the way to go; no having to tote two babies, and a 3 yr old, into the store to buy them."
2,"""Measure of a Man"" is truly one of 2003's best pop albums, thanks in large part to its brilliant production, fabulous songs (not a clunker in the bunch), and, of course, the amazing voice of Clay Aiken.Hard to pick a favorite, but the title track is worth the price of the album in my opinion.As I write, this CD is #1 on the charts. Clay, you are destined for a long and successful career, and this wonderful album is just the beginning!!!"
1,"Shirts of average quality...worth about what I paid for them, $10.00.....built in collar stays..."
2,"I love this pendant. My only complaint was that the stone needs to be polished but, other than that, it's perfect. The design really stands out and I get compliments on it often. :)"
1,"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore."
1,"This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Standard tunes like ""Unforgetable"" and ""Europe"" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on ""Sheila"" and ""Kicker"", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote"
2,"Overall the presentation of this game is outstanding, from the commentary to FOX music, fox traxer of slapshots of the ""Comet Tail""sports sound effects it really make you feel like you are really watching a TV hockey game. You can play all the teams or simulate games during a season mode, something NHL 2000 by EA sports eliminated in this years version, what a drag. In EA sports you can only pick one team to compete for the cup.-boring! My only complaint is that the guys don't skate very fast, rather sluggish. But once you play this game for a while you will realize that maybe the funnest hockey game Playstation has to offer out of it's new releases."
1,I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
1,"I had these bowls on my wedding registry and my sister in law ordered them for me. The first time they came, they were all broken and cracked. We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!"
2,"I found this book enlightening not knowing anything about the current sitaution in sudan other than bits and pieces in the news. I finished this book in almost one sitting i couldn't out it down. I knew of slavery in sudan ,but had no human face or story to put with it."
2,"Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate."
2,"This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much."
1,"First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs."
2,"I thought it was a superb read. It gives one the thought of dream to imagine themselves in their own world. It even reminded me of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"".....some. The Captian had a whole world, as well as a dream at his disposal. At times everyone no matter how high or low on the ladder they are, I think human beings need a special place like this story. A world to escape if you will."
1,I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars. I turned all of them on at 10:10p.m. At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and wouldn't turn back on. They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube. They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these. They were cool until they went out.
2,"This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy."
2,"My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!"
1,"the item that is stated does not look like the stock graphics , the picture that is show is not what the item looks like . dont count on a good quality product"
2,"Having had the opportunity to work with Stephanie before this book came out, I really didn't think I'd find anything new. I was wrong! Stephanie's story speaks to lots of women (and men) who will be able to see a way to overcome adversity. But the real ""meat"" of this book comes in the extremely useful tools and exercised that if used, will put you on your own success path. Thanks Stephanie!"
1,"I have been using Exuviance products for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied and feel I have found my skin care products that I intend to use for the future. But, unfortunately I had a bad experience when I ordered the products from Amazon.com(through a dealer called Impossible Discounts)- Rejuvenating Treatment Masque, Hydrating Eye Complex and Clarifying Facial Cleanser. All three products were dirty and did not come with any outer box or sealing. Actually, the products looked used! I have sent this complaint to Exuviance, but have not got any reply and now it is two months since I sent the complaint.. I am afraid that I will not buy Exuviance again nor buying at Amazone again after this incident."
2,"I bought this dress for my daughter, who is my Maid of Honor at my upcoming wedding. The dress is gorgeous! The perfect shade of red. The style is beautiful. The dress shipped and arrived faster than expected..which is always great! A great buy!"
2,"Easy to use, fast, good size -both for small amounts as well as a meal for 6-8 people, retractable power cord."
1,"I wish there had been SOMETHING in the product description that said these diapers were SCENTED! You'd think you'd have to claim that. Now, who knows if i'll be able to return them as i did open the package, only to find they are scented. my kids can't wear these!"
2,"I bought this for myself, and I really like it. The heart and key are very pretty, and as long as you keep it clean, there is a nice sparkle to it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the chain it comes with. It is very thin and easily tangles. I ended up ordering a new thicker chain for it, and now it's perfect."
1,"I bought this phone system about 6-7 months ago. I was happy with the performance, but very recently, two of the handsets failed. I thought it was a battery issue, so I replaced the batteries($30). That doesn't seem to have worked, as both of the handsets still won't take a charge. I have an older 2.4Ghz Vtech which has worked fine for the past 4-5 years, but more recent experiences with VTech have turned me off. Look elsewhere for a more reliable phone system."
1,"This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."
2,I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave shine in their roles in this excellent film based on Lillian Hellman's true life experience during war time. Fonda is at her best in this film playing Lillian Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave won an Academy Award for her performance as Julia. It is a movie not to be missed by serious film buffs.
2,"I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
1,"Spoiler alert there are zombies everywhere. This was a lame attempt at a scary story, but yes Clark and Lois have a moment... again. Don't worry though this moment will be forgotten in the next episode like it always is. Oh and Green Arrow is on drugs, which is kinda interesting because he went through a drug phase in the comics after he started killing people. Though Ollie in Smallville mostly just very angsty and self-centered right now. Smallville once and awhile has some good writers get to do some very interesting plot lines but this isn't one of them."
2,You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!
1,"This book was so bad it was the biggest waste of time in my entire life. The story line had great potential but the actual story itself was very, very weak and unfulfilling. The characters were worthless and it was without a doubt the worst ending on all time. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemies. The only reason I would ever buy this book would be so I can use it as fuel for my fireplace. I would have given this book a lower rating, but there wasn't an option for a half-star. You would get more enjoyment out of reading the dictionary than you would from reading this book. Absolutely Terrible!!p.s. They never find any gold!"
2,I am a beginner and I'm teaching myself. This book was very helpful in teaching me how to begin. It also has a lot of nice designs that I was not afraid to try. I found this book very helpful in getting started.
1,"well i as well saw/heared the DVD playing at a local electronic store and was tempted to buy it.after the first time playing it i was dissapointed to find only a couple notes worthy of listenign to.after the 2nd round the dvd became old.the impressions looked fake and the energy everybodys talking about somehow didnt show on my DVD.to sum it up, i expected something new and exciting and i found an early 80`s like band playing on a cheap movie.not really recomended."
1,"Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."
1,"Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
1,"This belt was not the right fit, we used the letters and numbers off the belt to place the order.... but still would not fit it was too big."
1,"I was convinced that after the great reviews of this product this had to be the best on the market. Unfortunately, it was not. Frankly it's the worse I have ever tried. There really is no tutoring at all, it's all questions and if you want the answer you would have to click ""answers"" and it gives you a useless explanation. Not to mention the mistakes in some of the answers.I'm almost certain that 95% of the 5 star posts are bogus. It's impossible for an actual user to be impressed with this product. I returned mine two days after using it. This product is the WORSE in the market, I'm almost sure."
1,"Within a few days of wearing this watch the star studs started falling out. A few months after owning the watch the three fell off inside the glass. I barely wore the watch after two studs fell out. It is sweet looking when it first arrives, but keep an eye out for silver star studs falling out if you ever where it."
1,"This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
2,"Two of the greatest figures in historical history are put under the microscope. Not only do we learn and walk in the lives of George Armstrong Custer but with General Crazy Horse, an almost Christ-like figure of humility and master of warfare. Crazy Horse fought for his people and their right to their land. Custer was a very complex character who loved his wife and his country, however, he believed he could never be defeated, a modern day warrior with Caesar complex. Robert Skimin has the skill and ability to present these two great leaders warts and all.What exactly led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. It's inside these pages."
2,it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. i mean it did have soulmates in and we got to see ash again which gains any book about three stares however short a time its for. i hope as is in the last book
1,"The book is really well written and I might be willing to read another book by this author.... but this book is just too ugly.I had nightmares after reading this book, it bothered me for weeks. Read it at your own risk."
1,"To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
2,"I would have to to even come close to what I feel is the best CD out this year. It's not filled with foul language, sexual innuendos, and you can actually understand the lyrics!!! What a concept!!! Clay's voice and emotion come through crystal clear on each and every track. While I've been a Clay fan since his Atlanta audition, I know people who weren't and they have listened to the CD and are now convinced. No matter what perception you may have about Clay, the man can sing!"
2,"Congrads to Ghost for always coming with fresh material. Yup, get this album... Ghost is killing it the way only he can, and the beats are what I needed right now, freshly cut soul samples make that make this album sound like it's out on motown. And for the ones hating on the new Ghost material; it's called evolution. The GFK doesn't need to play it safe with a played out formula. Support the true innovators! Peace!(4 stars so far, let you know in a couple if it's 5)Deshaies DaVinci"
1,"This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory. There may be worthwhile ideas here hidden beneath layers of obscurantist prose, but the game did not seem worth the candle,"
1,"when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?"
1,"It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana was never good, it was music for depressive people. Skip on this one that it is being release to fill the pockets of her stupid daughter and his stupid ex wife. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the most worst band of all times."
2,Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
2,"The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think."
2,This works great and keeps the coffee very hot. I wish the switch was on the front instead of the back for easier access but not a big enough deal to lose a star.
1,"Bought version 2.0 of this at a local bricks & mortar retailer. I couldn't get the software on disc 1 to work. Exchanged the disc - tried it on a few different computers but no luck, so I'm shopping for something else now."
2,I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA. I HAVE BEEN A LIFE LONG FAN AND EVEN I WAS KINDA IFEY ABOUT HER DOING THIS BUT THIS IS A LADY MADE OF SHEER DETERMINATION TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT.
2,This really one of the best books I have ever read. I really enjoy the mystical and unknown. The way Lawhead puts it together is amazing. He makes me feel that I am there and part of the action. I really enjoy how he adds another story in part of the story itself too. I have read the sequals and they are all awesome. This was the book that started it for me though.
1,"I don't know what happened, because the company I purchased the CD from would never respond to my e-mails. I highly recommend to anyone purchasing anything from this company to please read over all the reviews before you purchase from them. I ordered the product on July 10, 2012. It was suppose to be delivered from July 17 to August 1. I have yet to get the product or an explanation from anyone. I will never purchase anything from them again and hope you think twice before anyone else does. Thank You!!!!!"
1,"I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
1,"The packaging allowed something to stab through thepaper of the book and ruin the bottom of two pages. I repaired it with tape, but itcould not be used by anyone but me. I will keep it however."
2,"This is very nice, well made, real warm. Love the color, can fit into many decors. Awesome quality."
2,"If you liked Clay Aiken's style of singing on American Idol, you'll love his first album, ""Measure of a Man."" It's packed with songs that fit his character and reveal the force of his voice. You quickly find your favorites, but also the other tracks mysteriously have the power to grow on you as you listen to them the first or second time. You'll go from ""liking it"" to ""what would I do without it"" as you listen to it over time. Fans of vocalists alike with this American Idol show-stealer will embrace this CD more and more as the years go pass - it's a definite great buy!"
2,"I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?"
1,"""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."
1,The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process
2,Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
2,"Only a few times in one's life does an album appear that is ""genius"". Oasis put there name on the map or Rock n'Roll gods with this realse dated from 1994. Every song on the album has top 10 single potential. Must listen tracks on this album are ""Live Forever"" ""Supersonic"" and ""Slide Away"". What's pleasing about this record is that it is raw and captures a band in a live like sound. Liam Gallagher's voice never sounded so pure and brother Noel's guitar elements make this a must have in anybody's record collection"
2,"This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."
2,"This book would probably have to be the best work of fiction I have ever read, and I have read a lot of fiction. Short chapters, follows all of the characters so you have every aspect of the story line. Very interesting and just up my ally, hits very close to home. I connect with Victor very much in some aspects. After reading this book, you almost want to start experimenting with reanimation, and see where it goes...or maybe thats just me. Very good book though."
1,"I bought this 2 years or so ago, and I am STILL upset about it. it arrived and was a dark orange-ish color, and smelled rank and well just old. I would never ever buy from here again. I waited 15 years to have this fragrance because I could never afford it, only to be let down terribly. maybe they didnt know it was expired and had went bad..i dunno....in any case, bad bad experience."
1,"This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues."
1,"Like others I would like to voice my frustration with the paper feed mechanism. It worked fine at first but then it would say that there was no paper in the tray when of course there was lots of it. HP sent me a cleaner for it but it could only be used 3 times. When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem. Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer. Not sure if I trust HP anymore. Now I'm getting the ""No Scan Option"" message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"
2,"We have enough ""HIP-HOP"" & ""RAP"" music it's about time that we can listen to a song and understand the words and not be afraid for our children to listen!I bought Clay's CD the day it was released and was so excited.I couldn't wait to listen to it on my way home.I was very happy with the songs and Clay's outstanding smooth vocals.We need more Clay's to help shape the music industry by standing strong in his beliefs & values....Clay...don't change and thank you for helping to put a little dignity back in the world & music to soothe our souls."
2,"My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!"
1,I am the mom of a 4 and 7 year old and I wish I had played with this before christmas morning. All the the talk in my house about manors has gone out the window when all this toy does is fart and burp. My kids think it is histerical - I think I will find a way to exchange it for something else.
2,"To the Americans reviewing this product, this is the CTV coverage of the 2010 Olymics. CTV is NOT NBC. You are watching a CANADIAN product. We do not want to see American highlights, that's what the NBC DVD collection is for. Please pay more attention to the products you are buying before you buy them."
2,"What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !"
2,"Finally the facts behind the original molestation charges against Michael Jackson come out in a book written by lawyer, Raymond Chandler,who is also the boy's uncle. Written by one who observed it all, Chandler gives a fascinating but fact driven narrative of how the events played out in 1993. The facts: from the sleepovers, the Jesus juice, the almost near possession of the boy by M.J. to the powerful negative media blitz by the Jackson PR team against the family. This sounds all too familiar 12 years later.Great page turner with the facts to back it up."
2,"For its functional use, this watch is great. As a nurse I find having a time piece hat allows me to keep exact time for documenting events with a push of a button extremely useful. Having to wash my hands repeatedly, I need a watch that offers some resistance to water damage. It is also inexpensive and the price makes it all the more appealing."
2,"My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good."
2,"All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
2,"Pamper diapers are pretty good. They do not hold up as well as huggies as far as leaking goes, but for the price on Amazon its worth it!!"
1,"i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention."
1,"This book did not inspire any white light whatsoever. It starts out as creepy from the very begniing -- starting with a black aith a charcoal drawing of the author's face, which is half shaded in black staring right back at you -- creepiest thing I ever saw. On top of that, you're supposedly praying to God or Creator but he tells you that you have to pray to God calling him by a different name for each prayer-- names which came to him during many many meditations -- I didn't trust this book at all and it was in the trash within 2 days. I'm sorry I ever bought this lousy book."
1,This book was really dry... there were a couple interesting moments but most of the book was a lot of unnecessary words. This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!
1,"I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
2,I Bought this card for a third computer in my house and its the ferthest from the router and works fine.
2,"In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
2,"The Smart Spot made sense to me. I liked the business stories and explanations about energy in the ""physical world."" Instead of pop-psychology, there are plausible answers based on what the author apparently ""sees"". What's more, the techniques seem to be within reach.But does the stuff described in Smart Spot really work? I tried the procedure for grounding in a meeting and was pretty surprised at how much it helped.I wish there were more ""energy explanations"" in the book. North obviously perceives more than most of us, and I wish she had taken more risks to explain what happens on the non-verbal plane. Maybe her next book. (I also wish she would attend my next meeting and tell me what really went on.)This book has great ""visualizations"" that are not intimidating and that actually seem to work."
1,"Weak characters all around, but most especially Gibbons' portrayal of men. Plot had potential...but it never went anywhere worthwhile. Next."
1,"Ok i admit. I'm not a brain music expert. I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say ""do not use while operating heavy machinery"" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."
1,"The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a good book because it shows how someone could take care of another person that isn't very intelligent. It shows how someone could not be smart but still work hard. I liked this book because it showed how someone could committ a crime but for a good cause. I would recommend this book for soft-hearted people. Ramone P.The book ""Of Mice and Men"" didn't really interest me because in a way the title didn't really fit the story. Also, the point of the story was not clear. The title didn't fit the story because the whole book wasn't about mice and men. The only thing in the book about mice was when Lennie kept picking up mice and having them as pets. This book kind of interested me on behalf of Lennie because he wasn't very intelligent; he was retarted. I recommend this book to any one who is in depth with retarted people. Teaira T."
2,"I think this is truly a wonderful CD. My favorites are Invisible, The Way, Shine, Measure Of A Man, and Touch.Clay is simply amazing; I believe his voice is truly amazing. But I also believe we have not heard the best that Clay could be. I agree that the songs on this album do not necessarily do Clay justice. Irregardless, I am loving this CD!"
2,"Got a couple of these for the kids, good fun, well made. It looses a star because it seems when you patch through your iPod music to use the speaker the IZ puts in its music sounds-which is realy terrible, maybe there is a way to turn IZ off and just use speaker. Otherwise they are super tough and look great on the shelf."
2,Gives good complex look at the animals in different environments and shows the environmental issues challenging each place. Filled with stories from Jeff Corwin's life and his own encounters with both exotic and extraordinary animals.
2,"This album is what Wu Tang is supposed to sound like. Ghostface has proved he is one of the best rappers in hip hop. Every song has its own personality and classic Wu touch. I recommend this album to any hip hop fan. I wish this music was more popular, so everyone could know the true face of what hip hop is supposed to sound like."
1,"I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT."
1,"I like Pampers Dry for almost everything, except the fastening tab. I had tried every way: change diaper every 2 hours or so, make sure the tabs go far up on the diaper. However, as my baby is very active, crawling and learning to walk, very often he gets cuts or red bruises on his thighs, sometimes on the tummy, where the fastening tabs touch the skin.Please Pampers do something about the sharpness of the tabs."
2,After reading the reviews on this product I purchased a 2nd hand copy of Level 1 with great reluctance because I was certain I would be bored stiff but I am definitely pleased to share that I found the instruction thorough and well set forth. My husband and 4 children even sat through the entire DVD with me!Truly you would not purchase this for the cinematography or for entertainment quality but it well serves its purpose and that is teaching one to sew and to sew well. I am looking forward to purchasing Levels 2 and 3 next (though as a bargain shopper I wish I could find 2nd-hand versions for $29.99 or less also - LOL)
2,"This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet, lovers of music, and owners of quality DVDs."
2,This book has left me wanting more. Not many books do this for me. I felt the relationshop between the sisters was very cleverly written. Who could fail to like Darcy? ? A very real person. Also Sophia - at the beginning I disliked her - then I continually liked and disliked her - I still can't make up my mind. I have given four stars because I was frustrated that we did not discover more about Alex and Darcy. I hope a second book with these characters is written.
2,"Yeah, yeah, we know she has a loaded last name; anyway, a CD ought to be listened to on its own merits. As far as I am concerned, this is a keeper.Charlotte Gainsbourg's soft, mellow voice perfectly fits Air's melodies."
1,"First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."
2,"They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song ""Last Breath"". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under ""Metalcore"". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official ""head banging, mosh pit"" band of today, and this album definitely shows it. It even comes with a poetic title."
2,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
1,Unfortunately we didn't get to use this as we fell for the old 120 volt appliance into a 240 volt supply. Blew the buggery out of it. Be warned that if you want to use it in Australia it is not dual voltage. A good thing to remember if buying other appliances from America.
2,"Itten's analysis and application of color is thoughtful and scientific. As a practicing art director, I have successfully used the theories and methods explained in ""Elements of Color"" for over twenty years. I also teach them to my design classes. Whether you use a paintbrush or a mouse, his ""seven color contrasts"" will prove invaluable."
1,Can someone please list all the tracks from this album. There are some real Crystal fans out here looking for a good collection. Is this it?
1,"I grew up on the Narnia Books and thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was well adapted to the big screen. However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss..."
2,"This gunk will breath an extra few months out of the soles even the most beat up, falling apart shoes in your closet. For $6 or so you won't have to replace them so soon, just squeeze some of this goo into the damaged area and let it sit for 24 hours: Presto, a waterproof bond that will hold up until you are ready to buy a new pair."
2,"I first watched this movie on TV. The channel I saw it on played it constantly and it quickly became a favorite. I think it's a wonderful story and it has many great people in it! I do hope it gets put on DVD one day soon, so then I can watch it without hooking up my VCR!"
2,This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)
2,"I bought ""The Grass Is Blue"" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. They didn't lie. This is one of the finest things I have ever heard, from ANY musical genre. I played it for my wife, who has zero bluegrass background, and she was just swept away by it. Every cut is strong, but the odd-numbered tracks appeal to me most, with ""Steady As the Rain"" being a particular highlight. Be warned, ""The Grass Is Blue"" may permanently hijack your musical tastes. Now when I listen to blues and rock standards that used to appeal, I just can't sustain interest for more than a few minutes. Nothing compares to the power, the purity, the soul that Dolly Parton delivers. I am compelled to go back to ""The Grass Is Blue"" for another deep drought of that cool living water. This is one album I never want to live without."
2,"The book is so great for written such a great easy that I actually GOT INTO HARVARD because I did everything he says and I got in because of it. After all I was always a really good writer but I didn't think I had need to use an guide book after all, but I read it after all and look, it really did it work!!! My good written got even better and made me get into any really great school. So if you think you don't need help you are a good writer to, you might be actually surprized by you actually IMPROVE you're all ready good stile, but try it anyway and you will actually see just how many more easys you actually CAN write...do what he says and you to actually will get into the colege of you're DREAMS! Im so excited. Thank you mr Bauld."
1,"I found this movie very disappointing. I guess after Patton anything else would be hard to compare. That said, I had high hopes given the fact that I enjoyed the original so much. I did not even get half way through it before becoming bored with the plot. Stick with the original, you will not be sorry."
1,"All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
1,"After reading Walter Isaacson's, Ben Franklin, An American Life, the Autobiography of Ben Franklin by Benjamin Franklin was a huge disappointment. Written in the original, King's English, it is not an enjoyable read. If you want to experience the character and personality of Benjamin Franklin then read Isaacson's biography."
1,"I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
2,"With this small handheld game, you can think of almost anything and it will guess it even if a few questions are incorrect. This is probably the BEST BUY out of all handhelds. Never gets old."
2,"I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again."
1,"My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again."
1,"I bought the magazine subscription a WHILE back and has yet to receive an issue. It is very pricey and I thought it would be worth the price, if only I were able to have it! I contacted Amazon which then contacted them and have been told that sometime in late April the first issue of the magazine will arrive...I looked at many posts (sadly afterward) at cake central which had similar complaints. Save your money."
2,"This Motorola product is perfect. This cigarette lighter charger is as advertised, priced very low and is everything I expected."
1,"I'm sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. There are far too many modern pieces by contemporary Jewish composers, many of which would be considered quite out of place in an actual English synagogue service, particularly of the more traditional style. The leading composers of the Anglo-Jewish liturgical tradition such as Samuel Alman and Abraham Saqui are very poorly represented; even Israel Mombach, the English equivalent of Solomon Sulzer or Louis Lewandowski, only has 3 pieces on the album - and only one of those is typical. Finally, several of the pieces are instrumental (for organ) without any singing at all, which has little relevance to the choral music of the album's title.I have heard the Zemel Choir live, and on this CD they seem rather recessed and timid. Overall, a disappointing release."
1,"Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. A group of eighth graders could have written something better.The dialog is just plain stupid. I understand that the writer of this movie has gone back to working for a lawn maintenance company, and is given nothing more complicated than trimming shrubs."
2,"A friend of mine has Natalise's first album and I thought it was pretty good. But I was not prepared when I bought her new album. OMG this album is SO AMAZING! It is much better than my wildest expectations! We don't have any big record stores in my little town, so I had to order it and it and I forgot about it. Then when it came I was like, ""okay, let's see what it sounds like becaue the clips on her website where pretty good"". But EVERY song on this album is AMAZING! I love the slow songs, and she printed all the lyrics. The fast dance songs sound REALLY good in the car with the volume cranked all the way up! This is just all-around an absolutely stellar album. Natalise did an incredible job on it. I would not be suprised to see her win a Grammy one day!"
2,"This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it."
2,"I'm feeling this album. He has really stepped his game up a lot. The intro on the song is even hott.My favorites would have to be One wish, Keep sweatin',Lets play house, Melody, Sexy, Anytime, and What I need. The songs I didn't really care for are Unbelievable I don't like that song. Exotic I thought the song would be different. and War is over even though Rayj and Brandy collabos are usually hott I ain't feeling this song on this album."
2,Larry the Cucumber makes this cd hilarious!!!!!This is a great Christian cd with great music that you can sing along with and never get tired of. You are bound to enjoy this cd! It has great life lessons just like the movies. I recommend this cd to any one of any age. You will definetly enjoy!
1,"I purchased this item for my husband, who likes very hot coffee and tea, but it does not keep beverages warm as advertised. We tried it a few times and even when his mug went straight from the coffee pot to the warmer, it didn't keep it warm. Too bad, so sad. I returned it."
2,Great tools well made heavy duty can not beat then for the price would recommend to anyone looking for good tools
2,"What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end"
2,"This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion."
1,"After a tremendous amount of research, I was able to get to the bottom of the issue w/the HD version of Atlas/Aust. Revealed. I have confirmed that a firmware update is available from Toshiba players that will resolve the playback issues. A Microsoft update is currently not available but will be soon."
1,"I don't feel it's up to Adams' usual standard, nor as good as ""sniglets""--remember them? I don't like the idea of using existing words--usually proper nouns. More imagination was needed. And I didn't get the illustrations."
2,"I'll admit it freely- I only bought this book because of how desperately I fell in love with the recent Disney movie ""John Carter."" I just had to read the original story, and I'm not disappointed. For the time period it was written in, A Princess of Mars is well beyond its time, and absolutely satisfies my need for good writing. The storyline is altered from the movie, but a good read nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoy this book and am regretful of not reading it sooner."
1,"For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
1,"I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since."
1,The music plays just fine but the on screen picture is horrible. The picture is blurry and it looks like graphics form the 60's.
1,"Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."
1,"First off, my copy, Hudson House Publishers is a subsidy and self-publishing company. In old terminology, ""Vantage Press"" publishing. James paid to publish his novel. PARIS, WYOMING came as a gift as I generally do not purchase subsidy or self-published books or novels. Most do not exert ""tight"" editing and consist of numerous passive voice verbs and common writing errors. Secondly, I will finish this novel as my ""thank you"" to the one giving this gift. To complete reading PARIS, WYOMING, Wyoming will take forever. Lastly, whatever is the ""Wyoming Writers, Inc. 'New Horizons Award'"" as Jim James is a recipient?"
2,"This took about 1 minute to set up and I've had zero problems with it! It's been worth every penny! I can now schedule shows on my TiVo, via computer, when I'm away from home; I can send programs directly from my TiVo to my home computer (for saving on DVD, editing, or sending to friends); and I can access weather and other info right on my TV...but I think the best part is that my TiVo no longer requires a landline phone!!!"
2,"PREY isn't Mastertons best, but is entertaining enough. It's in keeping with his usual blend of intelegent horror and all out gore. I loved the book, and read it in next to no time, I dont usually read books twice, but I did this time. OVERVIEW: Intelegent. Bloody. And a great cast.Masterton has again come up with a winner, a page turner. A gore fest that will satisfy even the most thirsty of Horror fans. Pick up a copy, you wont regret it.Nice One Graham.... (Keep writing em.)"
2,This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.
1,"I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless."
1,"NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL! there are four discs, the only useful one is the first disc. it starts out by teaching you basic vocab...how to say bathroom, silverware, fruits, food items, how to tell time, colors, numbers and stuff like that. but then u put in the second disc and its speaking ENTIRELY in Japanese and it's impossible to understand whats going on or what youre supposed to do by just what you learned on the first disc. also there are interactive games to help u learn and remember, but the games are easy and repetitive and get boring fast! Not a good tool for learning Japanese...disappointing =("
1,"I found this book not worth the $$, it was well written but too sweet and hard to finish. Definitly not a page turner."
1,"I didn't recieve the DVD at all, was really looking forward to watching it :( makes me sad....... Wendy Johnson"
2,This is a great product overall. I was looking all over the place to buy these from stores but could not find it anywhere. My wife and I wanted to use these because the baby had used them while in the hospital and there is no washing or maintenance involved. However they are a bit pricey and the flow is fast relative to other nipples.
2,"This bed is great, but since my dog is a puppy and has decided to destroy everything in sight - I had to take it from him to salvage what I could in hopes he will settle down with age. He has already destroyed my soaker hose around the foundation of my house, most of my plants, my sprinklers, a lot of the siding on my house....and more (the swings never had a chance). I think this thing is great and looks like it will work well, but I will have to wait to hopefully get its full use. One of th great things about it is that it has the cedar in it to prevent bugs and stuff from getting on him. I just have to hope this destruction phase will end soon. Enjoy....."
1,"I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe. My son looks like he is wearing orthopedic shoes, I had to return them he just looked way to goofy"
2,"This week I keep thinking up reasons to spend time in my car so I can play this CD over and over. I'm not sure what I expected but this isn't it. This is so different from American Idol music. This music is fresh and new and filled with Clay Aiken's beautiful voice in all its range and power. I can't stop smiling. This is the future of pop music. There are a few tracks where I wish the background production was scaled back to let that pure voice shine through, but all in all I am surprised and very very pleased. More More!"
2,"If Im being completely honest, while I have been a HUGE clay fan since the beginning, I was a little skeptical about his first album because I couldnt imagine what type of ""pop"" songs he would be singing. Now that I have it, I cant listen to anything else! It never leaves my CD player! I love every song on it! Clay has an incredible voice and each of the songs is completely wonderful!"
1,"Don't know if discontinued product was out of commission for some time, but the battery I've received could not hold a charge (via USB) for more than 10 minutes. This was only used to charge a blackberry via USB which product designs mention should hold for more than 10 minutes. After charge, my blackberry only increase 3% battery power..."
2,"The ""Texas Beach Music"" we have learned to love has returned in it's full glory with 13 delightful songs! So good to hear the special sounds of the beach on a live CD. Mike nails it when he says in the opening song ""The name (band) has changed but the song remains the same"".Close your eyes, imagine you are in Margaritaville and take a journey to the Gulf Coast, ""Beach People, Beach Music"" will surely take you for a nostalgic journey. The CD has something for everyone, some Buffett cover songs like Pencil Thin Mustache, some beach favorites and some songs that I had not heard before. There is even a song with a strong Cajun flavor and sailing music for those so inclined. Sunday Morning in New Orleans is a smooth ballad that alone is worth the price of the CD.A great band making beautiful ""Beach"" music for all us Buffett/Parrothead/Island people.Billy Peoples AKA The Old parrothead"
2,"Excellent movie depicting how batman became batman. Excellent storyline, you're always thinking what's going to happen next. Great acting. This movie should definitely accelerate Christain Bales career. Good action sequences!"
2,"I purchased these hoping to balance my swinging moods and night sweats. I've taken these for about two weeks and I notice I am sleeping better and seem a little more at ease. I haven't really noticed if I break out sweating at night still yet but , the biggest noticeable result is my finger nails! I am a life long nail biter and within this short time I've grown a pretty strong healthy set of nails. Very nice affect. I've increased my dose to twice daily and I will purchase these again!"
2,"ok so I haven't had the squeem for too long to give a long term review (just received today) but I can say that it is torture just putting it on! It took me a full 30 minutes to fasten all the hook and eye closures and adjust it. With that being said, it looks very promising and am excited to see what it does in 30+ days of full time wear. Very excited. I do like it so far (the few hours I've been wearing it)"
2,"Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"
2,"A newly divorced young woman, a hot cop, Action and Romance, what more could you ask for?"
2,"A classic is a classic, but additional features in this edition make it a great choice. Nice illustrations, too!"
1,"Be very careful in dealing with this kind of material! First of all , it does not work! I was having a very hard time..health, financial..especially financial. These books are not only a waste of time and money..things actually got much WORSE!"
1,Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .The concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.Hard to imagine Wolfgang endorsing such a book
1,This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
1,when i ordered this product i looked at the picture of the case and when i recieved the blu ray it was in spainish and english which is fine if you show the same picture of the blu ray recieve and not like me which is falsly advertised.
2,"I am a big fan of the two young gun movies. The chemistry between all the actors make it a memorable film. Emilio's portrayal of ""The Kid"" will stay in my memory forever. At the end of the movie you are left with the memory of the laugh he always does."
2,"I read and reported on this book for my Probability and Statistics class back in college. It permanently changed the way that I view and evaluate polls, ratings, and statistics that we are bombarded with on an almost daily basis. Innocculate yourself! Buy this book and master it- you won't be disappointed."
2,Attach to your TIVO and it works very nicely. I have two TIVO's so I can transfer between them both.
2,"A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. If you aren't down w/ C.M.B yet, go get 400 degreez first. If you already got and you love it, this is just another hour of banging bump and car music. Great"
1,"I had this piece of junk for 3 months. When I put in a CD, static was audible in the background. At first, I thought it was the CD. Then I put it in my Aiwa stereo system and the sound was flawless. The radio reception was even worse. You have to turn the thing around in circles to hear anything but static. This so-called machine may be cheap, but I wouldn't want it if it was free!"
1,"Juggles large numbers of mythic references with some skill but not full confidence or accuracy, and doesn't really have a lot of insight. The book is also burdened with a Hildebrandt cover. I recommend David Colbert's ""The Magical Worlds of The Lord of the Ring"" for juvenile readers, or Anne C. Petty's ""Tolkien in the Land of Heroes"" for adults."
2,I am totally down with this CD. Its worth the money ya smack down to get it! Each song has a catchy mini-tune combined with total rhyme clusters. These guys are like a heavy Beastie Boys. Limp Bizkit can't touch'em! I urge any heavy metal/rap fans to get this...you will go home happy!
1,"I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
2,"I'm not a fan of Robocop and the movies with him, especially the ones from 2001, but this movie has totally changed my mind about him . This movie has great action, a good plot, great costumes, and a great script. I don't know why everyone gave gave this movie bad reviews because it's not a bad movie. I give it 5 STARS! Loved it!"
2,"I needed something to allow me to use speakers both outdoors and in another room, and this little unit filled the bill perfectly. It's simple, direct, and does the job. My only complaint is the speaker selection buttons on the front. They're really sticky. They seem to be set up so that when one set of remote speakers is turned on, the other automatically turns off (i.e., when you push the A button, the B button automatically pops back out turning the B speakers off, and vice versa). Nice, but what if you want both sets of remote speakers on at the same time? Well, both remote speakers can be on at the same time when both buttons are pushed in simultaneously, but then you have to jiggle them all over the place to get the buttons to pop back out and turn the speakers off again. Probably a picky point, but it's annoying. If not for this, I'd give it 5 stars instead of 4."
2,"Excelente producto, quedo muy satisfecho con el producto y con Amazon, por la puntualidad en la entrega,la calidad del producto, zapatos muy comodos, resistentes. Excelente muy recomendable."
1,"I'll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now.but as far as Pharell thinking He is the 2nd-Coming of Curtis Mayfield? NAW!Double NAW!!!! Pharell has Radny Watson written all over Him Vocally to me.whenever I watch Pharell up there singing I have a ""Coming to America"" Flashback.but the scary part is that alot of folks are taking His Singing Career as legit."
2,"I am in 9th grade and I am 15 years old, but there is something you do not know about me. I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone. The themes are as thick as crunchy peanutbutter."
2,"La primera entrega de esta saga, thumbs up, la entrega fue justo a tiempo y el producto en perfectas condiciones!"
1,"I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."
2,"Hatebreed (CONNECTICUT HARDCORE!!!!!) is amazing except for the less that spectacular drumming. Hatebreed now has a new drummer however (Woohoo!), so they're now unstopable."
2,Clay Aiken does it again! This is a great CD and recommend it to any one with ears!
2,"Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of ""Mad Max"", but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!"
1,"i find it incredible that so many people speak so glowingly of this book. on the basis of its literary merit it deserves a prominent spot in supermarket checkout lanes. that this is in any way respected as a novel or thought of as remotely historical (pre-historical, is suppose) speaks sad volumes about our society.i guess my one star may be a bit harsh. it's concievable that one could glean some amusement or light entertainment from this. but i feel a civic duty to in bring down the five star average it's garnered so far."
1,"I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn't very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn't very good neither - it didn't match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon."
1,"I've had a few of WP's coffees before, which were fine. This medium light roast I purchased recently ""Tuscan breakfast"" was undrinkable. Yes, it smelled fresh and robust. Thats where the kind adjectives end. I brewed 2 pots of this acidic, bitter, and harsh beverage that I wouldnt wish on anyone first thing in the morning, before deciding to spare you all the same fate... A better name might have been ""Industrial Byproduct"". Of course, some people feel thats what makes a REAL coffee. But if this came to a my table at a restaurant, I would have been, to say the least, dissatisfied.A little side note for those purchasing this or one of the more acceptable blends... the bag is a nightmare to open. Save yourself the frustration and grab a scissors. Cut the whole top off which seems welded together down to the wire wrap."
1,"I purchased this rack because it looked modern and cool. When it arrived, I was disappointed to discover how big it is. Even when folded, it takes up a lot more space than other racks. Since I have a small car, space is important to me and I don't want a rack that won't fit in my trunk or my closet.Also, the straps required a lot of effort to adjust and I could never get it really tight.There are better racks that are much cheaper, so I would recommed looking elsewhere. I exchanged this rack for an Allen Ultra Compact."
1,"I bought this rice cooker 3 months ago and was very careful to only use the white spoon provided to remove rice/porridge. I only used soft cloth to wash the pan and no dishwasher.However, after 3 months of use, the pan is scratched pretty badly and the coating is coming off. Not sure if I can replace it."
1,"item shuts off before cooking correctly, 10 mins in bun warmer turns buns crunchy, item has been re-released so maybe that one is better."
1,"We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
2,"Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes."
2,"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's ""Interprettation of Dreams"" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
1,"War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
2,"The two singles you've probably heard are ""Chop Suey"" and ""Toxicity"", both of which feature very original and surprising shifts in the speed and tone of the music, going from passionate rage to calm sweetness and back again. Be assured, these are not the only two songs like that on the album; it is a CD that deliveres what it claims -- exciting and creative music."
2,"The story Beowulf should be like a role model for other books. This books is very interesting and exciting for most of the book. It is like a roller coaster of thrill. You're on the edge of your seat all the time. I would give it 4 stars out of 5 because it has a couple flaws. For one it seems on the cover of the book and the review on the back the whole book would be about Beowulf fighting Grendel, but that is only half of the book. Also it gets pretty dry and dull at the end. It seems that the author started using less and less detail at the end of the book. Other than that I say this is a great book and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great book."
1,"This album was a huge disappointment for me. Buy diary. The songs on 'this is how it feels...' make me think that sunny day has lost it for good. i cant't remember hearing such a bad album from such a good band. try listening to ""Mogwai"" if you like sunny day."
1,"Recently, Nirvana released the amazing ""With The Lights Out"" box set. Truly, a definitive Nirvana collection.Now they have released this compilation, Silver: The Best Of The Box. All the songs on the record can be found on With The Lights Out ANYWAY, and they didn't even pick the most notable songs from the set anyhow.If you should buy this, you should only be a DIE HARD Nirvana fan, who only buys this on principal."
1,I am very disapointed with this story that the material was there to make this a fine epic but fell short of the likes of War Day now unavailable. You would get to parts of the story and feel like you where plowing uphill and getting no where but the promise of it might get better is a hope I was looking for and found some good quility gems in amongist some rough uncut stone possabily.
2,We've had good luck with Pampers and the Subscribe and Save program is a great deal. i really like that I can move the deliveries or cancel deliveries at any time.
1,"I had high hopes for this product and I was completely disappointed. If you like wearing makeup that looks very obvious, then this is your product. It was very cakey and did not cover anything unless is was piled on in multiple layers- which looks really attractive. Plus it always came squirting out of the tube without being squeezed. I ended up throwing it away in the garbage where it belonged."
1,"Regardless of what I have read here, I think this movie is not on the same technical or artistic merit as Akira or Ghost in the shell are. The graphic art is very poor, the story telling is also very badly done. Any one that is not a japanimation fan but does like pictures like the above mention, will find it as disappointing as I have. I do not recommend this title. don't waste your money ."
1,"I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the ""laws"" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS!"
1,"This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is ""borders on idolatry,"" that fundamentalists are ""often parasitic"" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to ""other approaches."" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having ""a totally closed world view,"" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."
2,"I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great."
2,"Good movie with good story line. Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie."
1,"I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
1,"I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
2,"For those of you who remember those early days of the 1990's, where Big Hair, Cross Colours, and great dance music. New Jack was at it's absolute height, Damian Dame delivered a musical masterpiece with their debut album. I loved every track on the CD, and after all these years, I recently found a copy of the CD and have been listening to it and enjoying it. ""Love Come Near Me"", and ""Virgin Island"" are among my favorite cuts. Sadly, both members of the group died on the exact same day two years apart, one from cancer, and the other from injuries sustained in a car accident. Never the less, they delivered a beautiful album on the LaFace label."

1,"I received this bird feeder, liked it, but when I tried to assemble it someof the parts were missing. The hooded pieces were missing."
1,I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
1,"I had to watch this in my band class when we had a substitute teacher because some teenagers are so immature they watch SpongeBob. I don't watch TV at all, and was not expecting to see this movie.The ""humor"" in this movie ranges from forced (the whole ""Goofy Goober"" thing, a Chuck E. Cheese-like establishment, only with peanutes) to disturbing (SpongeBob's mentally challenged friend Patrick Star flies into a ceremony naked with a flag in his butt). The only good part is when SpongeBob and Patrick get drunk off ice cream. You know what would've been the perfect ending? Them getting arrested for underage drinking.Hey, I'd laugh."
2,"Looking at this collection really shows the diversity in Hokusai's long career. In one of the essays, the writter comments that Hokusai changes his style so much that his work looks like the work of a different artist. The breath of this volume helps the viewer see how creative and inventive this master is. What I like about Hokusai is that his personal life is just as interesting as his work. The essays included do a good job placing the differnent periods in context with the times and Hokusai's own massive body of work."
2,"This is one of Verne's best books. It is full of scientific and technical/technological details (I had to use several encyclopedias/dictionaries to find some words' meaning), historical references - no doubt Verne researched the topics thoroughly. It is also humorous in places but certainly entertaining and serious on every page. As the story progresses you will discover Verne's view on society in sentences like ""The world needs no new continents, it needs new people."" As for the storyline, you will never guess what happens next. Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."
1,"Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!"
2,"As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up."

2,"The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it."
1,"I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12"" Powerbook G4. Unfortunately, it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off. If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in, it not only doesn't add charge, it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook. Wish I would've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger."
1,"Ok, so I'm exaggerating a little bit, bit not by much. Where the Iron Maiden shirts used to be printed on Haines heavy-weight t-shirts, this shirt was printed on a Delta t-shirt. Shrank to the point where it looks like a belly shirt almost. Cheap, low thread count t-shirt. When ordering these rock shirts, be sure to ask the seller what kind of shirt it's been printed on. If you're like me, you like to keep your rock shirts around until they get nice and faded. The DELTA shirts won't last that long. The eact same thing happened with a new RIde the Lightning shirt, and I'm a little frustrated. The HAINES and GIANT brand shirts tend to be high quality and don't shrink. *Please note that this is not an issue with the seller, but with whomsoever is making Maiden's licensed stuff now."
1,"This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."
1,"The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end."
1,"This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."
2,"This book is the most accurate that I have read concerning the earlier years of Billy, Starting with the arrival of his mother in New York City, fleeing the Irish Potato famine. I would recommend reading this important book along with the Billy book writen by Robert Utley, ""Billy the Kid, A Short and Violent Life."""
1,"I wouldn't buy this printer again. I have had it about 2 years. I get paper jams but that's not the worse thing. The ""OK"" button stopped working. So when I get a paper jam, I have to shut the printer off and then back on. Also when I put new print cartridges in, I can't use the OK button so I have the message on the LCD to ""Align the cartridge"".It does print nice pictures.Anyway, I have had several HP printers, they are usually great products. This is the worse printer I have ever had."
2,"very interesting band-can be fast and intense, and also slow and moving. The most interesting part of the band is what Serj Tankian can do with his voice, and in songs like, ""Chop Suey,"" and ""Toxicity,"" you'll see what I mean. Definitely has that middle eastern flavor to it, which makes this album so different and original and cool. All you people who have reviewed this, have no idea what ATWA is about, do you? Well ever hear of a little serial killer named Charlie Manson?..."
1,"The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song.Spend your money on something else or buy a whole cd of sting, not justy one song.You will be glad you did."
1,"Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
2,I found this book to be very well authored. It shows what you need to know and gives a very detailed method of teaching you the same technique. Though I think the overuse of wrist locks to be inneffective the overall method is great and proven in competition by wally jay and his students (see the history provided in the book)
2,"""Get your spider-fingers ready...!"" (wiggle, wiggle)That's how storytime begins with this book, which will encourage active participation even in babies who aren't signing.Very cute pictures of babies and helpful captions for parents on the pictures of signs make this a series of books you will enjoy together again and again.The series is slightly inconsistent in that this is the only book to feature a lovely REVIEW of signs used on the back page (maybe they had an extra page because the song is short?). I find the review very helpful, and it gives the baby another sing-along opportunity she always loves!Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic song that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long."
1,This movie needed a little more to it. It seemed like it was going to become really interesting throughout the movie but just kind of stays in the same place. Would not recomend it.
1,"I can't believe the rave reviews this CD is getting! I bought it because of the great things people are saying about it. I am terribly disappointed. This CD is not any good. The songs are ""bubble gum"" era, on most tracks the orchestration and backup singers are too loud and you can't hear Clay, the songs are not memorable and most of the words to the songs are really stupid. More importantly, they failed to listen to Simon's critique of ""picking the right song for your voice."" None of these songs are right for Clay. I can't believe Clive Davis produced this CD. Maybe I was expecting too much from a first CD, but my opinion is that this CD stinks. If you want a good CD, buy Bette Midler's new CD or a Josh Groban CD. Immensely better and you won't be disappointed."
1,"If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward."
2,"My 14 month twin boys are glued to the tv when we watch Eebee together! They giggle when they see little Eebee and love when Eebee plays with the ball. As a mom, I love seeing their faces light up when we watch this DVD. A must for all- I have to get the other DVD's now too."
1,"very odd version. wanted to show my english class and that did not work out well. good for a few laughs, however."
1,"Have always liked Clay Aiken, but the songs and Clay's singing style all sound the same. It is an extremely non-versatile and very boring effort. Compared to Kelly Clarkson excellent Thankful CD, Clay himself should be ""thankful"" that his fans helped him debut at #1. ""Measure of a Man"" is truly a disappointing CD."
2,I discovered this product a few years ago. Now I can enjoy the Hazelnut flavor without having to brew a whole pot.
2,"Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star. The opinion of his contemporaries that Raff was one of the greats is borne out here. The 2nd movement is so lyrical, it is worth the price of the disk by itself. The orchestra, though perhaps not well known, gave an outstanding performance. It is a pity that my CD from Amazon contained no program notes unlike what another reviewer reported. However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!"
1,Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.
1,"I disassembled this thing for pieces, and the construction couldn't be cheaper. The steering is achieved with an electric motor, not a servo, so it's ""all or nothing""; not very much fun. I recommend either get something much more expensive, or something much less expensive."
2,I got the movie on time and everything brand new the problem is I thought it would work in my samsung surround sound HD theater but it didn't. I can't really tell you anything other than I wish I can see how good it looks LOL. You will get your DVD on time though
1,"I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."
2,"I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. With the computer in the same room as my wireless card I don't even need to use the antenna. I am very impressed and it has worked flawlessly for me."
1,"I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded."
2,Great cast. Great episodes. Great price. I love every single episode from this series. sad to see it come to an end.
1,Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
1,"This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad."
2,"This product fits perfectly on my wrists. It's light but at the same time it adds a little variety to your workout. If you are just a beginner like me, I highly recommend this product."
1,"Bought this for a gift and was wondering how it would fit coffee grounds and have room for the filters. I thought maybe the filters were under the lid. Well, it must be only for coffee beans and only a small amount. The filter holder takes up one side of the container and it's not for the kind of rippled filters that we use. It holds ones that are flat. The person we bought it for ended up using it without the lid for a utensil holder."
2,Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
2,The superb instrumental quality music and compositions of percy faith has truly immersed me to continue looking for all his complete albums.It gives me great satisfaction during my meditative moments to enjoy his quality music especially his two bouquet albums.enjoy!
2,"Very good acting. Very emotional. I empathized with every character! I was very impressed with the the actors and writers, who weaved the story in a way that we were kept on edge wondering with the characters, what was going on."
1,"There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like ""Half A Week Before Winter,"" which mentions vampires, ""She Floats,"" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and ""The Wreckage,"" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as ""A Thousand Miles."" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."
1,Worked fine... until the battery died after one year. You can't replace it so essentially the player is useless. Would not recommend.
1,"The thing made great rice, including brown rice, but that turned out to be beside the point since it completely failed to function after a handful of uses."
2,"there must be someone who knows the answer to this: the baby as per wikipedia, says the baby was due 06/28/66 - My Question is: what day did the baby actually get delivered - ppl have told me yrs. ago it was 06/26/66 - any help would be appreciated!!!"
1,I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book.
2,This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.
2,"This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"
1,"I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me."
1,"Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, ""Song of Myself"" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections ""celebrating"" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."
1,This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book.
2,"I bought a Suburban that the previous owner had a little too much fun with. The mirror was broken and I needed a replacement. I called the dealership and gave them my vin to get the actual part number. The Left one and Right one are one number off from each other. Make sure you check with the dealer before you buy to get the actual number for the right wire harness... They wanted $450 for the replacement. I went with this one and it works fine. It doesn't have the feel of the factory one, but all of the mechanics work perfect. I recommend buying a pair. They won't match your stock one on the other side if you buy only one. But they look good together. -J"
1,"This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night."
1,I only used pampers for my son when he was first born because they fit so well and were extremely absorbable! But after I lost my job I started buying the big boxes from Costco that are the kirkland brand diapers (which are basically the Huggies). I purchased these because of the price at the time with free shipping and the price of gas it turned out to cost just as much as those did. Well I will not be using these diapers for him anymore! They do not hold anything in! He goes to bed with a new/fresh diaper every night and by the time he wakes up 8-10 hours later he is completely soaked through! Never once did this happen with the Costco brand diapers...or pull ups! For 2 weeks now he has been soaking through every night and that is without liquids before bed! No more Pampers for me!
1,"This card reader isn't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it."
1,"Candide is my favorite book, and I've read it multiple times in boh french and english. This is by far the worst english translation I've come across. It makes absolutely no attempt to preserve the grammatical structure of Voltaire's original, and consequently much of the irony and wit is lost. Read Candide, but not this copy.The Signet edition is not bad."
2,"I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
2,"So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
1,"I just saw this for the first time today and I must admit, I'm disappointed. I didn't get many laughs from it, I heard it was really funny. To me, this is a recycled version of The Wedding Singer, but it's much, much worse. The Wedding Singer was actually good. Nothing new here."
2,Bought a pair for my husband and he loved them. Not only do they feel good but they laundry well and stay looking good.To be honest if you have trouble with arthritis or replacement surgeries these are great. They let you move and turn over more easily.Forgot to say I purchased another pair also.Thanks Intimo.
1,"Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com)."
2,"I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation.It has excellent reviews but battery life is one area where it's been criticized so I decided to purchase a backup before leaving. I decided against a generic battery after reading that although they're cheaper, they don't hold as good of a charge as a Canon. I purchased one from ANATOLIAN BOOKSTORE, INC. through Amazon because that was the best price I found and I was very pleased that the battery was indeed an authentic Canon and holds the same charge as the one that came with the camera.It was delivered promptly, at a good price and was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again."
2,"""Crazy in Alabama"" is set in the early 1960's and combines several plots expertly: the Civil Rights Movement, spousal abuse, and parentless children. Antonio Banderas directs brilliantly. Melanie Griffith is a vision of loveliness and her performance is worth seeing all by itself! The bottom line is, no matter what the consequences, we must do the right thing."
1,I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.
2,"This is an old school comedy and it is not very well known, but it is a real cute and funny movie, with some wonderful actors doing a great job, a great storyline, and for all the guys some really pretty girls! ;) It is a really great romantic comedy that I highly recomend to anyone who likes this genre!! Out of 5 stars I give it 4 and 1/2."
2,"In this book, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn't know why. Soon, Lightning starts getting more dangerous and gives Pam a couple more bruises. That's when it's decided to get Pam's dad involved, but what's wrong with Pam's Pony? I liked that at the beginning for once that I didn't have a clue what the problem was. Even though I am getting a little old for this series, I like the fact that these books are well written and deserved to be read."
1,"""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" is poorly advertised. If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend."
2,"I love everything about the Saris Bones--especially the bright red that matches my car!--except the metal clamps that clip onto the trunk at 6 points. There's bound to be a better way to keep them from scratching the paint than my solution of wrapping them in Saran Wrap. Otherwise, it's easy to mount, holds the bikes securely, and did i mention it matches my car perfectly?"
2,"I believe this book is true but it did not all happen as Aura wanted. Which means she has more work to do here or, on the other hand, it is about over."
2,My child is 4yrs old and is REALLY into video games. With pure triumph to win a game. Alot of games are not made for the youngins. He is able mess with this game longer than five or more minutes. I as an adult don't enjoy it but he gets hours of pleasure.
1,"I could not understand why Amazon wanted 65 bucks for just a book with no description listed, so I went to Lowes and bought it for 20 bucks. Started reading and immediately found out that every word in the book refers to the authors' protractors and other accessories which can be bought through his web site. If you only bought the book with no accessories as I did, you are pretty much out of the loop as all the pictures and examples include his products. His system may work, but why not be up front about it? Just tell us what is going on, and if you are like me and already have invested in a really good (Starrett) protractor, pass on his book and get a more straightforward guide to installing trim.I also agree with others who think the reviews are fishy. Amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one, with no details on the product.By the way, I took the book back."
1,"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give ""2 stars"" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!"
1,"WE WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE MOVIE, IT WAS MORE LIKE A CLASS D FILM AND NOT VERY INTERESTING AS A WESTERN.MAYBE FOR CHILDREN??"
2,"If you've ever wondered *what if* about a past love, this is the book for you!! A GREAT read!!!"
2,"We dropped our phone line now that we can have DSL without it. Bought this item, hooked it up in about 5 seconds, and now we are saving $30 a month with no phone line. This device found every network in our area, even our neighbors which our router rarely can find. It's small and can rest on top of the tivo or on top of the entertainment center if there is no room above the Tivo."
1,"This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this. Reading this book will take about and hour and a half, though it will only feel like 20 minutes. Think Curious George. I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence)."
2,"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."
2,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
2,"This book, is a personal favorite. I started to read it and could not put it down for the life of me. Mr. Steinbeck did an amazing job and has written a spectacular novella. If there were one book I could recomend to anybody, this is it. The tale of Lennie and George is one with laughter, tears(the book brought me to them), and truth about the cold heartedness that exists in the human factor."
2,"I loved this story and am sad to have just finished the last page. Maggie Osborne is a brilliant storyteller. Her heroines are unforgettable, strong, funny, and completely real. She paints such vivid portraits with her novels. Lady Reluctant has risen to the top of my favorites by Ms. Osborne. It's everything one wants a romance novel to be and more....I rarely laugh out loud while reading and this book did it to me! Get this book and enjoy...it's a great adventure that will have you longing for more."
1,The reception has not been very good. I am disappointed.May be it will help to move it around.I hope so.
1,"I was completely disappointed in this ""film.""This film was LITERALLY put together by Spongebob Squarepants studio assistants and was a complete waste of my evening. Not funny, not humerous (other than 4 lesbian high-schoolers and the main character's ex-boyfriend who is friggin' hilarious in the few scenes he is in), and nauseatingly slow-paced.I won't go into a long description, but essentially, some girl is totally obsessed with Moz and stops by some of his old haunts in an effort to find and marry him. She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it. You will be disappointed. And remember, MOZ IS NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!"
2,"It takes alot for me to feel the urge to write a review on anything. I have very sensitive skin (so many things irritate it) and I also have dry skin. Recently I was having skin problems with my forehead (tiny little bumps under the skin). Nothing helped - even a prescription from the derm. When I used this peel literally within an hour I noticed a difference in my skin (not kidding). The little bumps seemed to lessen and my dry skin became smooth. I was afraid to use this product every day (bc of my sensitive skin) but so far I have had no problems at all. My skin looks so much better. No longer dry, tiny bumps pretty much gone, and tone looks better.I use it at night though instead of the morning. Kind of makes the skin a tad sticky."
2,I read alot on this game and think it sounds great. I will be buying this if I get good grades on my report card.
2,"If you happen to misplace the factory charger, this is the exact replacement you need for the cameras listed. There were no flaws in the product, and it came in safe packaging.The only problem is cost, but I wouldn't use an aftermarket charger so I was prepared to pay for the real thing. If you lose your Canon battery charger, go ahead and order this."
2,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
2,"This is a fascinating and detailed examination of the evolution of Israel from the perspective of early Zionist aspirations, through to the Hagannah and the IDF. Morris clearly has access to high quality IDF intelligence and archives. While many reviewers have focused on the Arab vs. Zionist sections of the book - presumably because these tensions feed naive political emotions - the text itself devotes a large amount of space to the double dealing by Britain that sowed the seeds of much of the current conflict. In my opinion, an understanding of international subterfuges plotted against, and subsequently thwarted by, a nascent Israel is proably the primary added value of this text. Irrespectove of one's ideological stance, Morris draws together a compelling account of the injustices directed at the early state of Israel (Yishuv). Well worth reading. Packed with detail and certainly not propaganda."
2,I've given three or four away for others to read... If you enjoy the parables you'll definitely want to get this book...
1,"I really wouldn't recommend this product. They say the bottoms are plastic coated, but I didn't find that. I ended up having to use a liner with it which didn't work at all. The cats used it, but missed more often than not, and it ended up being much more difficult to use than just a small plastic litter box would have been for about the same price."
2,So far the air filter has exceeded my expections..The purchaing experience through Amazon was great.. Godd service...Good product
2,I needed to upgrade from 128 MB to 512 MB. The memory got to my home through UPS (plus a dog bone for my dog) within about 5 days. Installed easily once I figured out where HP had the memory on the motherboard (behind the drive chassis!). Everything is working like a champ. Excellent buy and compatibility for an upgrade.
1,"Reading this book is a waste of time, buying it is a waste of money. It contain only very basic information, author thinks he's some kind of a all-knowing investigator, yet his orb photo is a mistake, literally, it's just a reflection.This books is more for self-promotion of author, than for providing information to people interested in becoming paranormal investigators, sorry. It will be better for you to invest additional $8 and buy this:Ghost Hunter's Guidebook: The Essential Guide to Investigating Ghosts & Hauntings"
1,"Disappointed by this item. I bought a couple of ""crystal"" decanters at the same time, which cost only a few dollars more. The difference was striking. This set is very dull, ordinary glass, and the rubber stopper in the decanter looks cheap."
2,"Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective."
2,"Still Love in Strange Places takes readers on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Kephart is really asking the questions, To whom do memories and stories belong? and How are cultural legacies passed down to a child. A fascinating book."
2,"I think this book is a requrement for anyone that is in the ministry. I found a lot of nuggets embeded in the book. Principles that the author provide for the reader are applicable to life and other disciplines. If you are seeking to enrich your theology education, I highly recommend this book. Written hundreds of years ago, Spurgeon's ideas and concepts transcends time. This book will be a part of my library for years to come. In fact, I purchased a copy for my brother since he is in the ministry."
1,"I have to say I've never had the paper feed problem that everyone else here complains about, and I've had my printer for well over a year. I came here, though, on a google search to try to find out why the color inkjet just never NEVER works. I don't use this often, but I was excited to have a color printer. I think the only decent color picture I made with this printer may have been the first one. Since then I've replaced the inkjets (expensive!), and clean them repeatedly just to get them to print, but they're always stripey, making the color printer (especially for photographs) essentially useless, making me wish I'd sprung a few extra bucks for a printer that might have worked better.As for b&w; printing, scanning, and copying, I've had no problems."
2,"I think the megaman PET is really cool. It is really cool that I can have my very own NetNavi like Lan and Chaud on the Megaman TV show. I get to fight viruses like Lan and enter tournaments once you bet 10 viruses.Then you can battle against rival NetNavis and use battlechips.I also like the fact that you can battle against your friends. The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away. Overall I think the PET is very cool."
2,"I purchased a ""book"" format box set called ""Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble - The Collection"" because the price was very enticing for a three-disc box set, as advertised in the Tower ad. When I arrived at the store, I realized the ""The Collection"", one in a series of such collections by Columbia/Epic artists, was simply a re-packaging of this original box set, expanded versions of his first three albums, rather than a budget-priced ""best-of"" box that I expected. Well, I bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did. This is indeed the best way to introduce yourself to SRV's early releases, and the price is right. (Some fans may argue his first three releases contain most of his best work anyway.) The bonus tracks may seem repetitive as listed, but they are in fact very tasty alternate takes of the final versions. So don't let the deceptive packaging by Columbia/Epic fool you - both these collections are one and the same. And they are great."
2,"I saw this movie when originally released in 1970.It had always left a strong impression upon me.Seeing it 42yrs later,is a real treat.It had created a profound impression upon me in '70 but years later it had softened a bit.The depth and beauty of Ireland is quite evident.Robert Mitchum,is stellar in this role.The story is timeless."
1,"this takes too long, you have to apply it all day and that is annoying, get the freeze spray from dr scholes"
2,"It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days. Disappointing acting, unoriginal stories, and recycled plots create a crapfest of bad movies. However, The Dark Knight shows us we don't need to be this way. Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors. The story line, while obviously somewhat recycled (forgivably so), is as original as its going to get, and the whole movie is carried off without much in the way of flaw. Granted, you can pick things out that are ""wrong"" but all within the realm of suspension of disbelief.In any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!"
1,This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative.
2,The first time I saw this movie was on the late show. I sobbed for a long time after I seen it. It is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. Every once in awhile I will watch it. It still makes me cry every time.
2,"This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
2,"While I am not a big fan of this costume, my four year old liked it and that's all that matters. She wore it almost every day before Halloween and she felt so proud to say to others she was going to be a super hero for Halloween. She definitely has enjoyed it, the price was great so I am happy with this purchase."
1,"After reading the two reviews, I purchased it and was I ever disappointed! It's nothing more than an overpriced, lightweight plastic trash can with a poorly designed plastic can crusher on top. A horrible value and wish I had not purchased."
2,I love pampers dry diapers. They do keep baby dry unless really full but it can hold a lot. I have been using these since my baby was born. The deal on Amazon is great when you subscribe.
2,"For rescue dogs, agitation is a big problem. They need time to adjust to a normal, less stressful life. DAP may help with this, but about the same time I also switched to home made dog food, started adding nutritional supplements to reduce their stress responses, so I'm not sure how much this product contributed to their mellowing. But the next time I introduce a new rescue dog into the pack I'll plug in the DAP aerator just to be sure."
2,Was the same product as advertised and it arrived in perfect condition. Price was much lower then auto parts stores. Easy to install and looks awesome.
2,On of the best and prophetic novels ever written about the descent into dehumanizing socialism.
1,"It's a cute book, although utterly misleading. The Atlantic wrote: ""A pleasantly subversive little book, guaranteed to undermine your faith in the almighty statistic.""The fact of the matter is that when proper, statistically sound data gathering and analysis methods are employed, the statistics not only do not lie, but they also reveal the nature and extent of the errors inherent in the results.I know - among other things, I'm a professsional statistician.In fact, it was my profession in statistics that steered me into network analysis, which is a statistician's dream world. Large corporations must figure out where the bottlenecks reside, and how to combat them in the most cost-effective, time-valued, long-term manner.To do this properly, it takes an individual who knows Finance, Statistics, and Networks.Bottom lie: Statistics themselves don't lie. However, the improper use of statistics can lead to erroneous conclusions."
1,"Having used Pampers for the last year and been very happy with them I was more than shocked when this last box arrived and the absorbency pad was half as thick as it used to be. Needless to say - my son can't even make it through a nap without soaking through his diaper let alone the night time. I am now switching to Huggies in hopes of not having to get up at 3am to changed a sopping wet, screaming child."
2,This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!
2,How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi's philosophicaland ethical system of thought?
1,After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.
1,"After season five this show should have ended but it kept going and going and going, turning into a teen drama like Dawson creek. I was so happy when they ended it last Friday and refuse to watch the finale. Instead I will savor the first five season's of this show. I hope everyone is happy that Smallville is now done and over with."
1,"I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged... Let's just say I strongly recommend you do not use this inside. Your insurance WILL NOT cover any related incident!Oh, the humanity!"
1,"The acting is horrible. The story is nonexistent. This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie. The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one."
2,"The Pyramid Bottom Bracket Type Display Stand is an awesome item to take the place of a traditional kickstand. I don't need to add weight to the bike while riding. The stand is waiting for me in my garage when I return from my ride. A few minutes after returning from my ride I am easily able to safely secure my bike in a stable upright position, reducing the potential for the bike being damaged through falling or knocking against an rough textured adjacent cinder brick wall. Couldn't be happier. Sturdy, and well coated to protect the bike frame from any damage from the stand. Also, raising the back tire allows for routine maintenance of the drive and back wheel components. If your looking for a low cost, simple way to protect and maintain your bicycle investment, this is it!"
2,nice oil for women - can't see much difference but sure looks large and in a great quantity - I'm sure it is helping on some level I am no aware of yet - highest mg I've seen out there - NOW seems a good company from the products I've had so far.
1,"We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."
1,"I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
1,"I'm an adult and a member of the ""Spongebob Underground"": adults who enjoy the cartoons but are afraid to say that to other adults. So, I'm a big fan and I've seen most all the cartoon episodes. I think Spongebob was the first great cartoon of the 21st century.But the movie just doesn't work. It's like they had enough material for a typical 11 minute cartoon and they tried to spread it over an almost-hour-and-a-half movie. It was strained humor, tedious to watch, and mostly mindless slapstick stuff for little kids. The part that the parents enjoy, that the kids don't get, just wasn't there (except for the NPR joke that I thought was hilarious). But one great joke does not a movie make."
2,I really enjoyed reading this book; it is well written. It opened worlds I had no knowledge of. My father was raised in the Hood River Valley and went to school with some mentioned in this book; this is real and living history to me. My life has been forever changed.
1,This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
2,"This is my favorite Steinbeck novel. It is a beautiful story and a must read. One of the few books that I would like to read again. Simply put, this is the story of a TRUE friendship between two men, one of whom is mentally challenged. Read it!!"
2,i did not like this movie but my little brother did! so i i recomend it for 9 and under!
2,"Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots."
2,"Detective Eddie Valliant has hated toons since his brother was killed by one, but now he has to help a toon that was framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Corporations and Toontown, for playing patty-cake with the toon's wife. On the way, they have to avoid a suspicious character who wants to destroy all toons using a chemical that disintegrates everything. Stop and think about this movie for a minute, and you realize that we are unbelievably fortunate that it even exists. It's a great movie. I highly recommend this for the family and friends or just a Saturday with nothing to do."
2,"Until I checked the amazon reviews page, I had never met a single person who had heard this album and didn't absolutely love it. I'm not saying that the single star givers aren't entitled to their opinion, but my experience is that my large swathe of Jazz Fan friends would unanymously give this 5 stars. It is not hard bop, but it is beautiful, whether you invest in the spirituality of it or not. This is one of the great albums of all time."
1,"Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
1,I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
1,"Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
1,"I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
2,"I've heard a lot of very hard bands in my day, but few are able to produce the raw emotion and sound of Hatebreed. If you are looking for an album to get pumped up to, whether it be working out or preparing for a sporting event, this is one to add to your collection. The album's only faults are its short length and some of the songs sound too much alike."
2,This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
2,Alot of people have complained that this could not possibly be the entire first season of the show but it is.... Even if the show had such a short first season it was still a really good deal. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it's a pretty good aswell!
1,"This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
2,"When you start with such good material, it's hard to please everyone. Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" many reviewers are disappointed that the movie didn't match their own visions of a great book. (Notice how no one ever complains that ""Goldfinger"" or other Bond movies are significantly different from the Ian Fleming novels?) Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects ""good enough."" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special ""Walking with Odysseus!"" Sheesh!"
2,"This book is impossible not to love. It is one of my top 5 favorite books. The characters and the story touch your heart and change the way you look at life. I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your taste in books."
1,_The Witch of Blackbird Pond_ is a very entertaing historical-fiction. The time it took place was during the time when the American colonies were being settled. This book was well written and would be great to read for people who love soap operas. There was not a lot of action in this book and no adventure. At times I didn't even want to read the book and other times I was locked on to it. There is some irony in this book and it can get very exciting. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book very much!!
1,"I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."
2,"Great information, great author. This book is yet another opportunity to realize how much there is to know. I recommend this one."
2,"This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack's Apple's green & orange light around the charging tip. To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15"" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms. And I prefer this one much more over Apple's when traveling. Highly recommend!"
2,"I would never know about TISM if i didnt marry a Aussie...After hearing Ol'Man River(Machavelli & the four seasons)cd. I was hooked. (Wanker.com) is great in your face music and its got a beat thats nothing i can find in the states. Its a little tough for us Yanks to understand but all that I've made listen to it love it at first hear..the beat and the tunes you just cant stop singing...aka ""whatareya"" & ""yob"" and the second disk ""Aussie Guitar"" is great! hope to seem them soon..."
2,"This little vacuum is ""Great""!! Light to handle, easy to use and no bags. Spill a drink - no problem, grab your ""Vac"" plug in the 20 foot cord and vacuum the spill in seconds. The unit steams stains away, then vacuums up the dirt with the water. Has an adjustable steam control, move from low-intensity to high-intensity for those stubborn messy stains. It was designed by Sharper Image."
2,"If you've ever eaten ""doubles"" on the street in Trinidad and wondered how to reproduce that delightful flavor at home, this is the book to use. The recipes are true native specialties, described so anyone can enjoy them."
1,"We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean. I have turned it completely inside out, scrubbed between all the cracks, and still food is stuck in the seams andthreads. It is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort."
1,I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.
1,"I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
2,"Not as complex as my ten years ago memory of it recalled, but that's not a bad thing. This is a little gem of a movie which tells its tale with economy and verve."
1,"I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package. I installed it, I made sure my photos were .jpgs, etc. I mean, I'm not stupid and I can read the simple instructions. It previewed on my computer just fine. I'm running XP-Home. Anyway, I can't burn the CD... it goes through the motions then it gives me one of 4 different reasons it won't burn. I called Tech Support. One guy was really rude, the next guy was good and said he'd send a new installation disk that day. Two weeks later, I got it. Uninstalled the program, reinstalled from the new disk, and OH BOY! A FIFTH ERROR MESSAGE. My computer is new, fast, and has an extra graphics card. 10GB hard drive, 512, the works. I am so sorry I got so excited about this worthless piece of software. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
2,"I don't know why, this Crowes record always seems to get the most rotation, in my car. It Could Be that it's starts strong and finishes strong. It is probaly the most solid of all the Crowes' albums. 'Nuff said."
2,"Oh how I love this book!Vimala Thakar writes beautifully and gives you lots to think about.I bought this book as it was on the suggested reading list by OM Girl (its a blog). Then I went on to buy her other book on Raja Yoga. She is elegant and insightful and I am so glad I found her.I will keep this book forever and one day when I am a more skilled Yoga Teacher, I will use it in my class and read the quotes."
2,"Excepts for shadows of Shame, i have loved every word he has written. he may exaggerate but he KNOWS Africa and how to tell a gripping yarn!"
1,"This is NOT Koss at its best. I recently bought its newest model and trashed this one. Don't bother buying it, a good price-bad deal! Buy the new one!Recommended Manufactors: Koss Aiwa Sony"
2,"I am extremely happy with this product. Simple install, just plugged into USB port of TIVO, it recognized it immediately and brought up the network menus. I selected WPA2 (yes, it supports both WPA and WPA2) put in the info and downloaded a movie from Amazon Unbox! Sweet!"
1,"Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor's and their sizing, this site confused me. I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company. Though the company did end up crediting my account back."
2,"I like these diapers and it's great to get so many at once, but we have had some blowouts up the back."
2,"Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique."
2,"Realistic 1960's horror film filled with great performances by an ensemble cast. I felt this was one of Roman Polanski's best directed films. Well written script leaves the viewer wondering until the final few minutes whether or not the central character is truly a victim or simply paranoid. Dialogue closely follows Ira Levin's novel. Unfortunately, younger viewers used to special effects or gore may be put off or bored by the lack of both. Horror and tension is created instead with dialogue and the viewer's imagination."
2,"This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" and most of all the sparkling ""Special."" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like ""Hammering in My Head"" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever."
1,"There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it."
2,"This is a delightful romantic comedy. Cher does a wonderful job of changing from a frumpy, overworked fiancee to a glamorous, sexy girlfriend of Nicholas Cage. Good performances by everyone."
1,I don't know how can this book be a classic. I haven't thought that I could find such absurd stuff in a book. Don't waste your time with it.
1,"""Final Analysis"" is one of the worst, silliest films I have ever seen. I have now abandoned Philip Joanou's filmography. It is slavishly formulaic, and just plain dumb, they couldn't even get the effects right. This is one of the few times that you will most certainly find something better on the Lifetime Network instead."
1,"My little brother just got this for his birthday. It's cool, but will probably be broken in a few days. The pieces that stick to the wall fall off alot. No action figures come with it either. And the bottom half is made of cardboard too--not cool."
1,"Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance."
1,The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work. Also the item is non returnable so I can't even return it and get a new one. ):
2,"The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."
1,"I am Asian and I have had many rice cookers of all sizes and quality. I chose Zojirushi brand because of its known name and quality. However, I am surprisingly very disappointed with this rice cooker/warmer. It is actually the worst cooker that I have ever had. It is slow in making rice but the worse is that it can't keep rice warm in the warmer mode. Rice dries up within few hours and its dry as a corn flake by the next day. I am very disappointed and I would not recommend this product.I ordered and replaced inner lid set for my rice cooker (approximately $15 including shipping) which I ordered at Zojirushi website and it seems to be working better and keeping my rice warm and moist."
1,"Please I read this book to give chance to opposition but found no credibility in the writers themselves. No Footnotes come on. Please go to [...]or even better go to their wallbuilders live podcast and find out about what the forefathers intended. They talk of the true definition of seperation of church and state. While at the same time hold ownership of articles that are displayed at the Smithsonian. They own thousands of articles including forefather letters and journals. In their own words letting you know from fact that this was to be a God Fearing Nation. David Barton offers books with insight into this subject for real minimal prices. I have seen his books and cd's on amazon. Doesnt it make sense to trust the words directly from our forefathers hand written words, or atleast from some one that owns the actual articles. See for yourselves please. May God Bless America."
2,These Hi-Tec Boots are excellent and very good quality.I use them while I am a rural carrier. they are a great work boot.I recomend to all. Peter.
2,"I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints."
1,"I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
1,I ordered this book because I thought it would be helpful in my work with troubled adolescents at a non-denominational residential treatment center. Boy was I wrong! It seems like there's not one page without NUMEROUS references to bible passages! I couldn't even make sense of what the authors were trying to say when connnecting their points to stories in the bible. This book is useless for my work and now I can't even return it! It should have been made VERY clear on the description of this book that it is WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE! All the Minirth-Meier Clinic series books should have that label/caution on them.
1,The book went very slowly and it didn't get interesting until the last few chapters (out of alot!)I would only recomend it if you like history.
2,"It works on my laser printer. Only after receiving the product did I realize there is another type of film made by the same company, specifically for laser printers. This is technically for copiers (same premise, I know)."
1,"As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. They really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.I ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.I wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from Country Curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. Of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!"
2,Very easy to use. The cooked rice is delicious. The only problem is that it cooks very slow.
2,"I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think ""Sliding Doors"" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"
1,"10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!"
2,"We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff."
2,"We used this during camping and loved it. Once again, Gerber produces another quality product."
2,"This is a fun little toy. My son got it this past Christmas when he was 5. When you get the winning three in a row, the machine spits out all of your change. You can put any coinage in the slot."
2,Decent movie; good action; no scrapes on the disk; NOT Biblically correct... it will make you think though; great ending.
2,"This CD really reflects the artist. Every track is excellent! If you are a Clay fan, I highly recommend this CD. If you aren't yet a fan, after hearing this you will be!"
2,"Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time."
1,"Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."
2,"Excellent book. Isaac Asimov ties together the Foundation series with his Robot books and his Empire books. He makes many allusions to those earlier books, even bringing back R. Daneel Olivaw, now 20,000 years old! Continuing the storyline in Foundation's Edge, he examines the conflict between individuality and unity, with the extreme unitists of Gaia, the extreme individualists of Solaria (who have even become hermaphrodites to totally eliminate interaction) and the moderates of the Galaxy. This book has intellectual excitement, some adventure, a bit of romance, and some philosophy. This is definitely one of his best"
1,"What a disappointment. I was thrilled that Amazon carried this 2-set c/d, but when it arrived it was ""unplayable"". With it's usual efficiency Amazon provided a return label, and I re-ordered the product. The replacement too was unplayable. Obviously a manufacturing error. While I was very disappointed with the product, it renewed my confidence in Amazon to stand by their customer refund policy. This is why I buy everything I can through Amazon. You can't find a better guarantee on the internet, or anywhere else. Thanks Amazon."
1,"This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!"
1,"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."
2,"I have this cd since it's release in October of 2003. I wasn't surprised that it's quality, in my opinion was only mediocre. I expected that from all the American Idols that were going to record.Loving Clay's voice from the start, I felt a little disappointed in the cd. He is truly capable of so much more. However, as time moves on, I am finding that his voice is still hypnotic and pure on this cd and it has grabbed my heart. I was hoping for more dramatic vocals, but in contemporary music, this display of his voice is really top notch.I am happy to say that Measure of a Man has become one of my favorite cd's! I can't wait for his next cd, which I am sure will spotlight his talent in again, a very different way. Bravo Clay...your cd is just great!"
1,"I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
1,"Only for fans of Hitch. Very dated for today's audience. Slow pace and confusing character development, especially Peter Lorre's ""General"". Stiff portrayals and a surprising lack of suspense. Where's a Macguffin when you need one?"
2,"Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
1,"I was told that this was a decent movie.But I didn't care for it. I find Adam Sandler as funny as Jerry Lewis, not very...The animation was pretty good however."
1,those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!
2,I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.
2,What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
2,Wonderful product that was easy to install.. Item arrived quickly. Necessary if you have the apprpropriate TIVO and not wanting phone line cords everywhere.
1,"A tiresome meander through bits & pieces of ancient history and philosophy to try to prove, once again, that there is a great effort to keep humans from realizing their potential and the secret wisdom that was revealed in former times. Dull, pedantic and unfocused."
2,After reading the previous reviews we decided to take a chance and purchase. We're glad we did. The unit is sturdy and solid and it's a bargain compared to others we've seen first hand. Would buy again without question.
2,"I bought this one in addition to a smaller shoe tree. It helps to keep the shoes organized, shoes are more visible than other types of shoe organizers. The product is well built. I've had it for a few months now and it's held up as promised."
2,"After listing to this album I can give it nothing but high praise. I think that Clay Aiken is the voice of reason that our world needs right now as so many people are affecting our children and how they see the world. This album is positive, upbeat and fun with a positive messgae!! Way to go Clay!"
2,"On my first listen to 'Catch Without Arms,' I was a little disappointed. I had been hoping for something that was closer in style to Leitmotif, but that's not what they delivered. But after listening to it a few times, I've gotten over the fact that their style has diverged a bit from their original sound. And, now I think that I do like 'Catch Without Arms' even more than their previous efforts."
1,"I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."
2,121 organ tracks or works on 16 CDs has to be spaced out in about six days. The music is so restful I found myself dowsing. The price for a new set through Amazon was right. Bach organ hymns made Luther.
2,"This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic."
2,"I thought that the book was a great review for the test and saw much of the material on the test. However, the test bank was down the week before my exam which was when I wanted to do the questions. That was very disappointing, but I did the test questions on the AAFP website which were both helpful and provided CME credit as well.Addendum: I just got my scores today, and I rocked the boards! I ended up in the 95th percentile. I also attended a course, but I felt that this book really put me over the top. It was great at some of the esoterica on the boards. My only beef is that I could not gain access to the online questions at all. Mine did not come with a CD, you had to log onto a website with a number provided in the front of the book. The week before my exam the website was down completely. I ended up not needing it, but it did stress me out right before the boards. Good luck and buy this book!!!"
1,"typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
1,This item is really beautiful. When I recieved it I immediately plugged it in to try it out and it worked great. So I unplugged it and put it back into the box. The day I planned on using it to keep already cooked hot dogs warm and on display for customers at a charity event. Well it never heated up when I took it out of the box the second time. Too late to send it back so oh well I am stuck with it. It is really pretty but that is the extent of the functionality I have found for this product.
1,"The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD."
2,"Book contains the results of exhaustive philosophical discussions, in person, with over 600 lawyers, including the President of the United States,Judges,Senators, Congressmen, and other Officials---All answers are based on the question:""What is the best evidence as to whether there is a hereafter or not?""..The book also contains a discussion of ""Assurance of Immortality"" by Gilbert T. Rowe,D.D.,S.T.D., Littt.D.-Professor of Theology in Duke University...Being that the writer was an Attorney-at-Law from the Buffalo,NY area, many of the inquiries are from within New York State area...An Interesting book of that era...A shame that it is out-of-print these days..."
1,"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."
1,"I tried this product. It broke during my first use. Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they'd send a new one. It's been a month and I haven't received anything. I'm over this company, Joy Hollywood. Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful. I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work. or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON."
2,"Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's ""The Perfect Storm."" Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book."
1,"Seriously, the first review with this title nailed it. I saw a different Takeshi Kitano movie a few years back which was much more stylistically interesting (can't remember the name, but it was a Japanese film), so I know he's capable of making an interesting film. This isn't it. This film is a terrible waste of time."
2,"I haven't learned the music for Way Out in the Desert yet, so I can't speak for the tune. However, the rhythm of this counting rhyme is a lot of fun. It gets a little old by the time you get to the tenth verse, but the beat is enjoyable. If you don't like poems that sort of get you into a singsong mode, though, you might want to skip this one.The illustrations are beautiful, and terms are explained at the end of the book. If you know how to pronounce both Spanish and English words, this text is a delight to read aloud. A great introduction to desert life!"
1,This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme.
1,"I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED! I emailed Farm & Home Supply Center for a ""RGA Number"" to return these clippers and never got one. I'll keep them but I'm not happy.If you want a straight cutting blade toenail clipper, these are not the ones. Get the Tweeezerman ones."
2,"Gopichand Jasoos is a private detective. Bela who is Gopi's neighbor, is to marry Jeetendra on her fathers insistence. She wants Gopi to find out more about his character. Gopichand sets on his work. His simplicity leads him to other way and in confusion he follows Prem Chopra instead of Jeetendra, where he detects that Prem Chopra, along with his three friend is planning to loot a bank. Gopi informs Bela that Jeetendra is a man with evil thoughts. The bank is looted and unfortunately Bela's father is the manager of this bank. He and Bela approach Gopichand and thrusts him the work of getting back the loot. Does he succeed this time? Watch Gopichand Jasoos."
2,The set-up was a little weird and random but the writing was excellent. It was fun to read.
2,"I bought this to be a candle warmer, not a mug warmer, but they are all the same. I like this one because it is black, so it isn't as noticeable on the dresser where it sits. The white one I had previously worked great, but it was so ugly on the dark wood. I am very pleased with the way it works."
1,"I thought I would give my ear to the sample cuts from this cd of Mr.Clay Aiken and I must say that I am so glad that I did not go and waste my money on the total cd. Clay, darling, the cd is bad. Do not believe the 5 star reviews that you have recieved. These people don't actually know music and they are not being sincere. Take what you have done and learn from it and do a better job the next time around. Your voice is wild and out of control. You are putting too much emphasis in getting your point across to the listener. I feel as though you are still feeling that you are in a competition. You lost. As I said, take this experience and learn from it. If you can't do any better, then shoot for Broadway."
1,"I thought this product would really come in handy for camping. But after owning it for just a couple of days, I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took. The lantern would not work. I sent away for a new bulb, but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features. Unfortunately, with typical Black and Decker quality, don't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring. It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout, but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break."
2,"I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be."
1,"As a redhead, I bought this book hoping to get some coherent info about redheads throughout history. Honestly, I put the book down a while ago and haven't been able to pick it back up. There's something about the way that Ms. Roach writes that feels like eating cotton candy all day - it's vacuous without much substance. She flows into tangent after tangent, with moments of wit, and then fails to deliver any ""final knowledge.""As far as any allegations of an anti-christian nature to the book, well, it's called superstition, and christians weren't exempt from that, however much they would try to deny it. Ms. Roach does discuss witch meetings, so if you're threatened by that, stay away.Overall, not worth the money."
2,This book was required reading at least twice in grade school and I never complained. Something about it made it an instant classic in my mind. I fell in love with the characters!! It's short and sweet but still a wonderful read.
2,"While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation."
2,"I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."
1,"While Clay Aiken does have an amazing talent for singing, he's album better suites middle-aged America instead of a younger, more ""poppy"" audience. I get irritated seeing people compare Ruben and Clay. They are in two totally different genres!"
2,Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection (Manhattan Melodrama / Evelyn Prentice / Double Wedding / I Love You Again / Love Crazy)Is there a better way to spend the day than with the charming Powell or the beautiful & witty Loy. The best ever coupling of two hollywood stars. If you enjoy watching class in action or witty dialogue you will love these 4 movies especially Manhattan Melodrama that has the extra bonus of the wonderful CLARK GABLE.
2,"I love having my coffee (or tea) hot instead of cold when I take a sip! I love this, I use it at the office!"
2,A progammable thermostat that you can actually set differently for each of the seven days - perfect for people with non traditional schedules. And the 'off the wall' setting capability makes it very convenient to set up.
2,"THE SANSA VIEW IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT LACKS BASS POWER. THE VIDEO PLAYER WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU FIND AN EASIER WAY THAN PROVIDED BY SANDISK. USING THEIR PROVIDED ""SANSA MEDIA CONVERTER"" WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THEIR WEBSITE TAKES HOURS TO CONVERT A MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW, BUT USING THE ""PSP MOVIE CONVERTER"" DOES THE JOB IN COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW USING RHAPSODY MEDIA PLAYER. ONCE I LEARNED TO DO THAT I BEGAN ENJOYING THE PLAYER. THE PICTURE VIEWER IS GREAT AS WELL. I ALSO OFFER THE FM RADIO FOR WHEN U WANNA HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DSEPERATE FOLDER FOR AUDIOBOOKS AND PODCAST, EXPANSION SLOT. A BANG FOR THE BUCK."
1,"Yes yes, I know your thinking ""EVERYBODY LOVES SPONGEBOB!""And I do admit that it is funny and cute. But It is quite annoying. The show was fine. But a MOVIE?!? I would rather watch a 24/7 marathon of Telatubies! The only person in SpongeBob Squarepants that is even remotely funny is Patrick Star!And like every other movie based off of a show, when you return to the show, THEY ACT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED! Not to mention a lot of people are mad a Nick for canceling Invader Zim! So if you want to save yourself from brain damage, I recomend not seeing this movie.Trust me, that would be a wise choice."
2,"I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book."
1,"I bought this product about 11 months ago. However, I've only been able to use it for about 6 months because it keeps malfunctioning. I had to ship it in twice for repairs at my own expense. This last time, they even forgot to ship back the memory card. Now I have to wait again...When it works, the product is great. However, it's so unreliable that it's not worth it. My recommendation is to buy another brand unless Compaq can get their act together."
2,This item is just what I needed for our new espresso machine. The item is nice and large enough to froth milk without making a mess.
1,"It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"
2,"Finally an official R1 release of Initial D Stage IV...and its really good! Visual presentation is not bad at all, the best of all Inital D stages in fact. And the Japanese audio track is done really well - best sound quality I have ever heard from Initial D. The subtitles are passable, not that bad. The English dub is still horrible...but then again there has NEVER been a good Dub of any Initial D stages. The video is present in 4:3 widescreen format, not 16:9 as indicated on the DVD cover. Initial D has never been made in 16:9 ratio anyways, has always been 4:3 format.Stage 4 is the best quality of all the Stages, both in art and story.Highly recommended."
1,"Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats. What a disappointment! Neither cat even nibbled, and when I left some outside for the neighborhood stray, he even passed! Save your money and just buy grocery store treats."
1,"Although filled with photographs, this book contains no developmental histories of Saab aircrafts, engineers who designed the planes, technical specifications or performances except in passing references. Even the photograps were not particularly valuable, as they contain no cockpit or other interior shots. It's just a hodge-podge collection of pictures, not an useful book for aviation enthusiasts or aircraft modellers."
1,"When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
2,"All the elements of a great movie. What can I say, I love to study the elements of war, and I enjoy a good love story along the way. This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie."
2,THIS REFERENCE OF OVER 1000 PAGES IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED TO TRANSCRIBE SURGICAL REPORTS.
1,"As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the ""long sentence"" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: ""I'm trying to be literate, not literary."" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."
2,"I'm an avid fan of biblical historical fiction...I love the way she brings this story to life and keeps you in suspense. Details are clear and accurate....beyond that, you're drawn immediately into the story, the character's thoughts/emotions/motivations/lives, and hoping they choose to follow God. My biggest acclaim for a book in this genre is having read it that i find myself loving my God even more, seeking harder after Him, understanding just a little more, and wanting more of Him! My faith is encouraged! Definitely recommend!"
2,"This kit actually fits 1993-2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ's, not 93-98 as the description above may say. It's a great basic replacement cat-back kit. It's no Borla, but you're not paying Borla prices either. The only parts that you may need that do not come with the kit are two metric 10mm 1.5 thread pitch bolts - and that is only if you have a 2000-2001 Cherokee. The exhaust sounds great, a little more bass to it, but no drone or rattles. Very easy install, removing the old rusty exhaust is always the hardest part.One other helpful note - if you have to replace any of the exhaust hangers on your Cherokee due to rust (the rear one in particular), they can be hard to find outside of a Jeep dealer. NAPA tends to carry them however."
2,"Expertly written by Paxton Quigly, ""Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World"" presents a detailed exploration into the issues of female self-protection. On page after page the reader will discover practical advice on handling diverse threatening situations, critically important commentary to which they may refer when finding themselves in such positions. The problems of rape, molestation, and undesired groping are effectively dealt with through the mean of furthering of education of the reader with what Paxton Quigly has to offer her readers. ""Stayin' Alive; Armed And Female In An Unsafe World"" is a very strongly recommended reading and instructive, practical guide for women seeking their own form of defense from sexual predators and physical abusers."
1,This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
1,"I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality."
2,"After mentioning this book several times, and keeping us waiting, that she would fictionalize the whole theme and characters... came as a surprise. But then when you see how her fictional series, Canopus in Argos, developed in a science fiction setting, you tend to understand that her best work , sometimes needs to come from a distance. That being said, this novel is a fulfillment of many loose threads, and themes that she, and we all, struggle and deal with in our own ways. Throughout her body of work, a life's work, she continues to keep her eyes open and focused on both the future, AND the past."
1,"I bought this video thinking that it would be a great tool to teach about fires. Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part. They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job."
2,"The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives."
2,"One of my favorite movies! Impressively sharp in blu-ray. Possibly the best of John Fords' ""cavalry trilogy"", the real star is Henry Fonda with John Wayne in a more supporting role. Doesnt appear that the other two movies in the trilogy are yet available in blu-ray, but am looking for them."
1,"I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
2,"When I bought my Dreamcast, I got this memory card with it for free. It is a great card, except that it has no screen like the VMU card. It has a button on it, that it allows 2 cards in 1, giving you 400 blocks. I've had it since December 2000, today is October 2002, and I never had file loss. This is a great buy, even though I got it for free. If this had a screen, it would have been a great buy. Plastic is very cheap. My controller fell, and the memory card was in, and part of the plastic chipped off. It doesn't matter, it still works. I recommend this card to anyone who needs a larger card, and doesn't want to buy a VMU. Great card, keep up the good work Nyko!"
2,"When I herd them for thr first time they blew my mind I love them and they lyrics , I just love listing to good music!"
1,"My nutritionist (who is a celiac) asked me to burn this book! The advice is fanatical. Throw away your non-stick cookware, plastic containers and wooden spoons because they are contaminated. Pleassse!"
2,"Wonderful writing, slow and steady and relentless as a long walk on a hot day on a dusty road in the deep south. Tragic central story of a proud black man who has tried to live as just Man, not black man, and suffers for it when he is wrongfully accused of murdering a white woman, a woman who for many years was his lover. The further you read, the more certain you are that this cannot end well - but no way can you stop reading.Classic Faulkner at his best, with the typical huge cast of 'characters' (in every sense of the word) and side plots."
1,I ordered this part as an upgrade for my HP e-pc c10 which requires specifically HP part P1538A. I thought this Viking part is compatible as it clearly says HP Part# P1538A by Viking on the Amazon heading. The computer couldn't boot up on installation. A phone call to Viking tech support says it won't work on e-pc series despite it being P1538A compatible. so beware!
2,"It was a pretty good Sci Fi book. When taken as a series, there are some great twists and turns. I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about. There is a theory on how the human race came to earth, as well as a war going on in space unknown to those on earth. I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story."
1,I only listened to one song and please that was all i needed this type of music is just thatit really doesn't fit anywhere but broadway stage you talkin about a one album wonder. In this business everyone knows it is not just about how many albums you sell it is about longevity which people seem to forget about and please believe me when i say clay most likely did not doany writing. so who's really getting paid the songwriter of course. So don't let sales blow your mind understand most of that money went back to the record company. And i am not a fan.
2,I bought this mixer for my husband off his wish list. He was very excited and loves it!!!!!
1,This antenna does only work with old school Sirius devices. All Sirius XM devices use a different voltage that the one supported by this antenna. Buy the Pixel PRO-600 instead.
1,I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. I am very disappointed because that is the only reason I purchased this book. They should not use printed version reviews for Kindle books.
1,"I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a ""lesbian,"" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."
2,"Does what it was designed to do and more. Holds my HP 15.4"" laptop perfectly. Gives me added peace of mind knowing that my brand new laptop is that much more protected while in its normal carrying case; keeping it from rain, accidental spills, scratches, etc. The included jumpdrive case matches the sleeve and is quite handy as well. Overall, excellent product."
1,"Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."
2,"Veteran guitarist Herb Ellis and and a somewhat newcomber guitarist Duke Roubillard showcase some fine jazz guitar interplay.Even if you're not a jazz fan, you'll appreciate this fine playing. This quintet presents three Roubillard originals with four standards.You'll hear the similarity between this album and the Great Guitar albums from past years. A fine addition to any guitar jazz lover's collection."
1,"... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV."
1,"I wish had thought to check out the reviews on a site such as this BEFORE I bought the book. Considering this is a work which is supposedly meant to help people overcome toxic anger, I imagine many people feel even more angry upon discovering the very heavy Christian slant of the book."
1,i bought this cd for one song on it sgt. mackenzie and i was disappoint that the it was broken up into three parts on the cd
1,"Light Speed Biology: Super Pack - This will be the best buy for extremely cheaper price, instead of buying 5 separate dvds and spending $3 for each package."
1,I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again
2,"Video killed the Radio Star. If this music came out in 1968, this band would have been a headline act. However in the MTV world, if your not pretty, you don't play. I recommend these guys to everyone."
1,"Oh dear. If 7 brides for 7 brothers is one of your favorite movies then by all means buy 8 women which is equally silly. Life is Weird and so is this film directed by Francois Ozon who should have been kicked out of the academy for this one. Arnaud De Moleron, the set director, should never be employed again. The set is so ugly is steals attention away from the silly action and songs in film. Fanny Ardant is beginning to look quite piggy in the face although her figure is still fine. If the intention was to make a movie in the vein of 1950s Hollywood drama/musical this film fails on all accounts. Unless you are a die hard fan of someone in the film don't waste your money."
1,"The book was in good condition, however, they should have stated that it had been owned by a library. I would have known then that it was stamped in several places and not have purchased it."
2,".Tom Bodett - the ""We'll leave the light on"" Motel 6 guy - wrote and performs this cautionary tale of respect for the whims of Nature for kids and their parents. Part ""slice of life"" in the Alaskan ""bush,"" part sociology - can ""bush"" and ""town"" kids find common ground and interests? and also a warning on why kids should listen to grown-ups (all these years and we really HAVE learned something ;-), this captivating adventure will while away the hours whilst travelling."
2,"This book is one of the best in the Saint-Germain series. This is the second book I have bought, since the first one was read so many times it fell apart."
1,The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours.
1,"This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."
2,"Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but reading the real, written work is another world. It is a different way to think of the story you know. I bought this compilation to read all of Shakespeare's works and it is truly great. One thing I'd advise is that you know how to read scripts. This book is written as Shakespeare wrote his plays. Though, every work is prefaced with the characters names and role they play, it can still be a bit difficult to get through because of the way it's written.Jul. Then, window let day in and let life out.Rom.Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.[descendsJul.Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!It can become a bit much.I gave it four stars because it has such small font: around 8 or 9 px font you'd find on MS word."
1,"These diapers are TERRIBLE. I bought them, hoping that they would keep my daughter nice and dry all night long when she sleeps for 12 hours. When she woke up in the morning, her sleeper was wet and her skin was very wet as well, inside the diaper. The diaper did not keep her dry like it claimed it would. Her Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers kept her way drier then this diaper! When she wears those all night, they soak up everything and her skin is still pretty dry the next morning. I will never use Baby Dry again."
1,Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn't charge it without the cycle turning itself off. The size & fit were good; it just wouldn't take a charge.
1,"This item is not what you think it is. This video is only about the war, not on what horrors were done to the people in the camps. Except for history buffs and teachers, this would not be a good video just for viewing pleasure."
1,"This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer."
1,"I was warned by many that this is a one star movie at best. Silly me I had to see for may self. If there is someone you do not like then you can recommend this movie to them.Not that the premise is bad enough, that of Nazis surviving in the underworld but the film itself had cheep graphics and stilted dialog. The actors looked like porn star rejects. They did not even try to be campy. The gory parts were pathetic and anatomically incorrect.Do not let your fast forward button over heat.I am going to cut the review short before I barf."
2,I found this book very informative on the subject of Cairn Terriers. Probably the only one needed. It's detail makes it ideal for use as a handbook and the many colored pictures a pleasure to read and see. It includes product suggestions as well. I found I still needed more information concerning training than what was covered in this book.
2,Typical of George C. Scott he lives into the Patton character. You do however realise that this is not the same man who lead the 3rd Army into victory in Europe. He is tired and exhausted. One could relive the last days of agony in which Patton found himself during this terrible time in his life with Scott. An excellent performance. I would recommend this to anybody who is in the first place a fan of Scott and in the 2nd place a Patton fanatic. A must have for all who are interested in Biographies of WWII leaders.
1,"I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. So, I decided to read it. I was very dissapointed. Though some concepts were fairly interesting they were not developed, so book had no point. I cannot understand why this novel is as famous as it is. Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451."
1,I used these as candle warmers rather than coffee mug warmers. I bought 5 of these and would turn them on probably 15-20 minutes at a time. They ended up almost exploding or busting open after a while and exposed the insides. It scared me. One of them just stopped working altogether. I'm completely disappointed with this product.
2,"Though not a fan of his astrological writings for Vanity Fair, this book is mind-blowing. I have had it for over 20 years (even had it rebound at Kinkos). It has truly helped me reinterpret the motivation of countless people in my life in a way that's helped me improve those relationships. It's a book like no other in the way it helps me make sense of other people's actions by understanding their point of view (haven't read his new book yet)."
2,"The opening Gombert Lament is a stunner, as is everything on this disk. It is recorded in a live, but not muddy, acoustic which really puts a beautiful ""glow"" on the proceedings. This would have gotten 5 stars from me except for the lack of texts and translations."
2,This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.
1,"Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works."
1,"It keeps your coffee warm but not hot. The problem is that most cups that are made do not have a flat bottom, therefor do not have enough contact with the heater to transfere heat to the cup."
2,"Sometimes, a movie with a (mostly) all-star cast backfires. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. Not so with ""The Dead Girl."" It helps that each of the interwoven plot lines are presented as vignettes, each one poignant and beautiful in it's own way. It really allows the viewer time to get to know the characters. Brittany Murphy was amazing, as was Marcia Gay Harden whose portrayal of the dead girl's mother will stay with you. Great movie. [...]"
2,Dylan? Jagger and Richards? Lennon and McCarthy? For my money the best songwriter ever is Guy Clark. His latest effort does not dissapoint. It is a social injustice that Guy Clark isn't a megastar. Nashville needs to wake up and recognize the talent that they have and not the hacks they continue to play on the radio. The Shawn Camp song is awesome. Shawn Camp is the best kept secret in the world. Here's hoping he does another album someday.
1,"I can't understand how Manhattan Transfer gets all those studio musicians to play on their albums. I mean, it just makes their singing sound worse against the best drumming (Steve Gadd), bass playing and sax playing in the world. The two stars are for Kafka and the studio musicians only."
1,To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible.
2,The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand! Can't wait until the next CD is released! Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!
1,"At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said."
1,"I bought this printer from Staples back in January. It was terrific and I really was hoping to take advantage of the scanner, the printer, and the network port. Seemed like a great package. But the paper feed issue is real.I'm using standard printer paper from Staples, nothing fancy. But the printer simply isn't picking the paper up. If I don't do anything the ""Out of Paper"" message appears. I literally have to push the paper in when i'm printing (of course that sometimes causes the printer to jam known as a lose-lose)Also, the software the comes with the printer is dreadful. Scanning is good, but forget about it if you want to copy pictures off a memory card you stuck in the printer.It's too bad, i've never had such a bad HP printer experience either with an inkjet or laser at work. I'm dissappointed."
1,"I bought this album because I heard a killer version of ""White Christmas"" on a station on Live365. The link pointed me to this album. What a dissapointment! The tracks are half-baked, synth-drenched remakes with none of the swing of the song I heard. Liner notes are non-existant, leading me to wonder if any of the original Drifters even had a hand in this project. Don't waste your money! I did manage to locate the version I heard on Rhapsody on an album called ""Soul Christmas"" on Atlantic Records."
2,"This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth"
2,Not too much to say; it is the book I needed for class and I got it at a good price on Amazon.
2,"I already had this title on standard DVD (single disc), but I couldnt pass up the opportunity to get this on Blu-ray when Amazon dropped it to 11.99. I wasnt going to replace any of my standard DVD discs with blu-ray versions as the upconversion displays them well enough. But upon seeing Batman Begins in blu-ray, I was confident that the 12.00 was worth it. Excellent 5-star transfer."
1,"Nothing happened from beginning to end. No action, certainly no bloody zombie action. It was like ohhhh the dead have risen lets try and stay away from them if we can."
1,"The fragrance on this product is egregiously intense. In fact, I tried to air twenty of them out in a closed room and the air in that room over a matter of days would make you light headed and naseus. Don't buy them!"
2,"I thought ""Continuum"" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise. There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama. Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance. This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection."
2,"I had an old Linksys WUSB11 connected to my Tivo series 2 to link it to my wireless network. It was slow as a dog! My signal strength hovered around 7 to 10% and often the Tivo would fail in it's attempts to download files. I just installed this Tivo G adaptor and my signal strength increased to 94%. Now my downloads are much, much faster! I don't know why I didn't upgrade before. Installation was a snap. I unplugged the old one and ran the new cable w/ this one. The WUSB11 uses a standard USB connector on both ends and this Tivo one uses a miniUSB on the device end and standard USB connector on the Tivo side. I went to the settings / network page on the Tivo and directed it to connect to my existing wireless network and it connected. The key thing is that I did NOT have to restart the Tivo or reset the network to get this to connect - it was very, very simple"
2,"I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is ""This is a paranormal disaster area!"""
2,"This book surprised me. For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which ""The Technocracy"" regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."
2,I read this book in fourth grade and I still rember the wonderful book! I decided to read it again and it wa just as good as I thaught it would be!
1,This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
2,"If you don't know who Kelly Worden is then it's about time you find out. I just attended his 2009 Water & Steel seminar near Tacoma, Washington. It changed my life. This video is quite old now and Mr. Worden has progressed a great deal since the time it was made. However, it lays out his methods well. Training in his garage converted dojo, he shows you how to completely dismantle your opponent. He employs a no-nonsense, down and dirty, in your face approach. His material is geared for real-life situations wherever they may occur, in the street, bar, your home, anywhere. I highly recommend this video to everyone. Look him up on the net for many more excellent videos."
1,"Almost one-half way through this so-called mystery, I had to put it down. Perhaps you had to be British to care about whether Richard III killed his nephews. There seems to be more engaging historical mysteries. And what about the use of research as a device to tell a mystery tale? It simply did not work. Perhaps she could have written a history book instead? I didn't get it. Also, I doubt if I will read anything else by Tey."
1,I was very disappointed with this. It barely keeps my mug of coffee warm - barely luke warm for that matter. I don't recommend this product.
2,"This is a great cd. It takes a few times listening to it to start enjoying it,then it sounds like a new,but familiar lagwagon. This one was dedicated to Derrick Plourde, their original drummer that played the blistering drums on duh,trashed, and hoss. He committed suicide in 2005. This album is very well written,even though it only took them 2 weeks to write the songs. This album is definately up there in their top 5 albums."
1,"My step-mom decided to waste money not once, but twice, getting one for my 6yo brother, and 5yo nephew...both of them(the blue one) if you press it's stomach right say, and I quote:""It's time to get f*cked up!""That is not appropriate for kids at all, and we will be seeking legal advice on this toy!"
1,"While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology. If you don't subscribe to such beliefs, like me, you find yourself unable to care about the plot or see it as worth your effort to understand. All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock. It felt like I was watching the Catholic equivalent of the cheesy Protestant _Left Behind_ series."
2,Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times.
2,"This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding."
1,"Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
2,"I really liked the movie and i really hope this is the Last Transformers movie.I am only giving it 5 stars for the movie and not the price.I think that is to much for just one dvd which is not a blue ray copy.This price should go down to at least $15.00yeah new movie but price for this nope.Transformers will be always cool, to me at least the three movies did come out good,I would wish they stop making movies from cartoons, Leave the cartoons alone.5 stars for the movie not the priceAlso in the movie, new actors, and new leading lady she was good,His parents had small parts which is good because in this movie they showed him more of a grown man.The scenes from the movies are cool, shot in Chicago and that is a cool city,Alos make you think of the cover ups that really did or did not happen on the moon, or why we went into space.So if you already have the other two movies get this third movie but try to find a lower price"
1,"This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
2,"I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
2,I bought this item because mine were old and broke. I use it as an alarm clock and enjoy it.
1,"Why are they still selling this? Worth a laugh, but the feature is 30 minutes long and I bet your laugh won't last all the way to the end."
2,"Mike Connors was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he is talking to Blue. Blue has something special to share with Mike, Blue is a serial kiler who is stalking the people of the small town where Mike lives. Blue wants to shre his thoughts and feelings with Mike, but Mike doesn't want to know. Mike is also making Blue angry - something that he really doesn't want to do. This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book."
1,I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
2,"Not factual? How can someone say that! It was written by Linda Lee, Bruce's wife! How can it not be factual? I personally found this book very good. It is an easy read, and it is very informative. This book changed my perception of Bruce. Where I once saw a wonderful martial artist, which I still saw, I now see someone who was of profound mind and good heart. His intentions were great, his mind and philosophies greater, and his legacy shall live on forever. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!"
1,"I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
1,"This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
1,"Well yea sure its supposed to be this wonderfull, amazing, groundbreaking platform game. Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank. All in all it probably would be pretty fun and thus you should add one or two stars if your new to this kind of thing, or add a few stars if you really really really like large environments or just platforming in general."
1,COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly? Baby Mama Drama? What about love longs and decent ones at that. The second CD was a keeper. Musiq should practice his craft or lose a fan. Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it.
1,"Though good workmanship, I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name."
1,"I had this charger for over two years. Last week while it was plugged into my computer, it just died. No blue light no current. I ended up splicing the connector to my old frayed Apple charger. The connector is much better than Apple's."
2,"I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact."
2,"I agree with Mr. Keller: book reads more like a practical guide.It doesn't resemble a traditional treatise like Siegel's ""New York Practice"". Caselaw and primary law is almost non-existant.Double spaced and large font pages seemed a bit sneaky. Forms are provided in 6 pt micro type so don't expect any blank form copying.As an overview this book is nice solid beginner's reading. Author shares some practical and personal insights which are useful. Hint: If you happen to fall behind in bills, it's a good idea to read this book. It'll tell you what Mr. New York Bill Collector can do to you (and what he can't or won't bother to do).Good law and even bad law books are very expensive. This book sells for 15$ and it provides many solid hints."
2,"Amazon's review is wrong; this 1974 LP often gets confused with their 1965 LP, mainly because they are both simply titled ""Hollies"". This one is the band's reunion LP with Allan Clarke, and is one of their best from the '70s, with delightful tunes such ""Falling Calling"" and ""Down on the Run"", both featuring harmonica. Why this LP only generated one hit, ""The Air that I Breathe"" is a mystery; everything here is equally commercial-sounding. Unfortunately, the happy atmosphere here was short-lived, as the albums that followed were workmanlike affairs, with a general lack of musical direction. No matter; The Hollies are one of the great pop bands, and this is one of their best moments."
2,I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
1,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more with hers than the actual movie does, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, Badly written characters and insane plot clichs that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the rental but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film."
1,"Pampers are good quality, pretty good protection against blowouts, etc. But we have two complaints. First of all, there's a mesh on the inside that sticks to baby's bottom pretty consistently. Worse, for us, the ""dry"" part is because of chemicals in the diaper, which caused our baby to develop red, rashy skin very quickly. We've since read that this is a common issue with Pampers, especially ""dry max"". Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend. Huggies and others have worked far better for us."
1,"Tubthumping was Rad! But the rest of the cd doesnt stand a chance of being a hit, the rest is just terrible. I didnt expect any of the other tracks to be singles, and they havent, though they do have a sophmore album."
2,"Scrapped Princess is a very fun show that is perfect for all anime fans! its very original, and fun even for the parents to watch :D"
1,"Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see..."
1,"We received the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump on September 10th 2008. It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder. Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a ""traditional"" mattress. The first 2 months it worked great. She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain. The next few months we had to pump it up every other day, but she still was in less pain. Now today, April 11th 2009, just 7 months later she can't even sleep on it. Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat. Our daughter is now sleeping on couch cushions until we can find a new bed. Don't waste your money on this bed! Find ANY OTHER airbed, you'll be much happier."
1,"Absolutely excellent!a mixture of pace, adventure, humor, add some originality to it!very good cocktail for young and old!BUT there is no audio French, not even subtitles !!!!! what a shame for the editor so I put only ONE STAR because of that !!!I got it in VHS and I transform it by myself, and I saw it in TV in FRENCH, so it exists !!"
2,The book has great instruction and drills. It is good for those who have a solid foundation with joint locks and submissions and an overall solid grasp of the body and movement. It has given some good variations of techniques I already teach and use.
1,Why on EARTH has this been released in pan and scan? I've watched my VHS copy countless times and was looking forward to replacing it with a nice widescreen DVD. But this? Fuggitaboudit!
1,"I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
2,"Nice, good solid amp. I use it as an inexpensive monitor amp for some parts express br1 monitor kit i built. I do some audio recording on an inexpensive computer I put together with linux. Fun, cheap, solid components and inexpensive software that will let ya get started recording on the cheap!"
2,Very good product. Just a advertised. Was worth every little penny I spent! Very happy with this purchase! Awesome! Pleased!
1,"I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his ""Helter Skelter"" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."
2,"I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
2,I love his voice. Clay always takes me there. I love every song and I can't wait for his next album.
2,"From Country Grammar to SweatSuit Nelly has done it again with the sing-a-longs, the boomin' beats , exploding lyrics. Nelly is on top there's no doubt that nelly has step back on the scene with a hit. The new single Grillz is only the beginning, not only are there the great songs before but there new songs on there with the hottest collaborations like paul wall, big gipp and St. Lunatics own Ali. Oh and lets not for get the great new song with Nortorious BIG!!! That's history in the making...So i advised anyone and everyone to go cop that new album buy nelly sweatsuit is the hottest cd out right now!!!!!!!!! DERRTY ENT!!!WE ALL WE GOT. Much love nelly's boo"
1,"After the okay-ish Part 2, this sequel plunges the series into the depths of diminishing returns. The...er, plot, involves an evil Japanese organization who are determined to take over the city with the help of some decidedly uninspiring robot ninjas.Souless, tame, humdrum waste of time and money which seemingly relies on constant flashbacks to the first (and far superior) Robocop film. If you haven't seen any Robocop movies then see the first one instead of this. If, on the other hand, you've seen the first Robocop film, then be content with that. You won't find anything worthwhile in this trash."
2,This is yet another book that is difficult to put down. There are a few sections that you have to trudge through but it is entirely worth it. This is a very thought provoking novel and is beautifully written.
1,"I don't know what i'm doing rating a spong bob movie. let me say it was a complete disappointment, and boring. but then i remember this is exactly what its supposed to be, a kids cartoon. not an anime for late night airing. buy it for the kids, if your an adult fan, then skip buying, and renting. we realy don't need to watch sponge bob ""grow up."""
2,"I've finally gotten the chance to read this book after many recommendations. It was rather hard to put down, with its compelling plot line, memorable characters, and poignant moments. What I found most interesting was its historic portrayal of Brooklyn as a growing neighborhood and home to European immigrants during the early 20th century -- where the beginning of a developing ""American"" political and cultural identity affected the lives of those such as our main character, Francie Nolan."
1,"I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
2,"The book is a reprint of the biography written by Marie Curie's daughter, Eve Curie in 1937. It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said ""No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit."" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."
2,I knew we had a winner the first time I heard his voice in the auditions. This CD is amazing and I listen to it constantly. I just hope he has another listen to all year CD coming out soon.
2,"If you are into this type of jazz (ala, Gene Harris, Oscar Peterson ) , you gotta love this CD. It is high energy, fun, yet masterfully played. It has an eclectic mix of jazz, blues, and a little funk. There are a couple of live tracks that captures the energy of the audience...and you can imagine how amazing it must have been to see him live. This is going to go down as one of my favorite CDs next to Gene Harris's Concord Years, and Oscar Peterson's Night Train."
1,"what the hell is this. 5 loosers from enlgand trying to copy the beatles. i mean even there fans are so stuipid. i read one review which one of the oasis fans criticized thebeatles for being a rip off of OASIS. hello dude the beatles were 1963 and oasis is 1994. that should be enough to skip this album and get hte better of these clones THE BEATLES.r.i.P. JOHN LENNON, GEORGE HARRISONTHEY MUST BE TURNING IN THERE GRAVES"
2,"This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all."
2,These diapers are great for daytime but did leak when used overnight. I don't know if the 12 hours protection they claim on the box is all that true so I did also order huggies overnight diapers as well!
1,"THIS FILM IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE IN THE WAY THAT IT CANCELS OUT THE ORIGINAL BATMAN MOVIE AND BATMAN RETURNS. TURNS OUT JACK NAPPIER DIDNT KILL BRUCE WAYNE'S PARENTS, IT WAS SOME OTHER BLOKE. THAT IS THE MAIN THING THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS FILM. ALSO AT THE END THE JOKER SEEMS TO BE HANDIN OUT CARDS. DONT THINK SO. NAPPIER FELL INTO A BOWL OF ACID AND TURNED INTO THE JOKER. HE ISNT THE SORT OF GUY TO GO THROWIN JOKER CARDS ABOUT. VERY STUPID. BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS ARE THE BEST BATMAN FILMS MADE. KEATON MUST BE OUTRAGED CUS I WOULD BE IF I WAS HIM!"
2,"Muy entretenido libro, lleno de fotos que muestran a la Iglesia desde diversas perspectivas, tanto como sociedad, cultura y como religion. Contiene varios ensayos fotograficos en varias partes del mundo. El texto es sencillo, y mas que nada es para acompaar a las fotos, y siendo que se puede comprar usado por un par de dolares, constituye una ganga de las que hay que aprovechar."
2,"In this trying time in our country, I found this movie to be very refreshing. We were able to feel a surge of emotions throughout the film, and end up happy. What a nice diversion from our daily lives and the stock market. Everyone should treat themselves to this great escape for a couple of hours."
2,Veggie Tales: Dave and the Giant Pickleexcellent movie for children involving religious background from the bible with a musical twist. my granddaughter loved it.
2,"This is a awesome CD from a ""A-list pop star! Beautiful voice. You will want to pick up Solitaire CD also. All these negative post from people who never bought or listen to the CD are funny! Makes you wonder why they are even here posting."
1,"not as great as i thought. brought it because it was costing me $10 per tube. have been applying it for about 3 weeks now and saw little difference. you have to keep reapplying the gel to get some type of a result. i had used other products just once for about 6 months and they had worked much better - buy the more expensive stuff (maxforce or advion), dont go for their price!"
1,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
2,"We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shot,MRI, special night boot, creams to rub on his foot, etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction."
2,"THIS BROTHER IS TIGHT. MILES DAVIS TIGHT. YEAH, I INVOKED MILES. PAUL,YOU GOTTA KEEP BREATHIN.THE FIRST CUT WILL KICK YOUR A@#. I PLAYED THE FIRST CUT FOR FOUR HOURS. I WAS DANCIN IN MY SEAT. PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN KNEW I WAS CRAZY. I'M WAITIN FOR NAHOO 3. I HEARD IT'S OUT BUT NO-ONE SEEMS TO HAVE IT."
1,"We, for me, was not a good read. Perhaps if I was a mathematician and not have read the other dystopia books, Brave New World and 1984, it would have been a fun book to read as other reviewers have stated. Perhaps this was a serious book, but it was not an entertaining book to read. The book was a can."
1,I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
2,"Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight."
2,"I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers."
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is probably the single hardest job an actress would take on. I belive that people are expecting to see the actual Audrey Hepburn. That is not going to happen. Mrs Hepburn is regarded as the best actress of all time, and to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt can have the same performance is not logical. But Ms Hewitt does a wonderful job of capturing the charm and grace of Hepburn in a way I don't believe that any other young actress could do. Who else could pull off this part? In my opinion, no one else has even close to any resemblence to Hepburn compared to Hewitt. I believe this was a wonderful film and it made me even more interested in some of the classical Hepburn movies that I have not previously seen. Give credit to Hewitt for tackling such a hard film and pulling it off. A job well done."
2,This one's much more entertaining than the other Batman movies. It's a good story based on Bruce Wayne's sincere desire to see justice done and his willingness to lose all to accomplish it. There wasn't too much sensuality although Katie Holmes wore some tight shirts and it must have been chilly on the set.
1,"If you want a low-tech, outdated, poorly produced micro-biography of Ralph Ellison that runs about 15 minutes (that's right--ignore the time posted above because it certainly isn't 30), then this may be what you are looking for."
1,"To the reviews that are claiming this book is the absolute truth, how do you know? You have a Uncle here that has not talked to this kid in over 12 years? Was not in the picture when the kid was hanging out with Mr. Jackson. You have a family here that extorted money from Michael jackson plain and simply. Thats why this kid now an adult refused to testify in the 2005 court case. To the readers who really believe this book ask yourself if my child was molested would I take $20 million and let the person run free to molest others? I for sure wouldn't! Food for thought!"
1,These diapers absorb MUCH less than Swaddlers. They don't have a prayer of lasting through the night despite the claim they last twelve hours. Really disappointing product.
1,"This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold."
1,"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
1,"I love this book, it was a great read.However, there are simply too many mistakes, misspellings, etc in this version. This is the very worst edition of any book I have ever read. I started highlighting the mistakes on my kindle, but there were just too many and I gave up.Add to that that the chapters are not marked, and there is no proper index.If you do buy this horrible edition, be prepared to read around an obvious error every other page or so.Some examples include:""There were four others oil the committee""""And they would sit round die table""Bottom Line: I want my money back."
1,"I read this book for our book club. The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book. Betty Smith wrote this book based on her own life experience, but she did not add any value for the readers who read the book (in my opinion). If you have no interest in experiencing poor childhood or awkward adultlecense, I would not recommend the book."
1,"I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."
2,"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."
2,"This is the greatest Christmas story every made or told. I only buy ""Charlie Brown"" Christmas trees now. My wife hates them but she doesn't understand what Christmas is all about."
2,"From the keyboard intro to Pleasure Palace all the way to the end of Jealous Heart, this album never fails to deliver. There are no filler tracks, every song is a 110% example of what a classic rock song should sound like. Where are they now.........."
2,"This was a great story from start to finish as other reviewers have stated. Danny is a waiter at a local restaurant when Ariana and her controlling mother and her companion stop in for lunch. Ariana's mother is controlling of her because Ariana is deaf and feels she needs to make all of her daughter's decisions for her even though she is 21! It is love at first sight for Danny, although Ariana's mother doesn't think Danny is good enough for Ariana and does whatever she can to keep them apart. Kent Moran also performs his own music in this movie which is great! There are a couple more twists to this movie that I don't want to give away. Great tear jerker romance worth having in your movie collection."
2,"This is one of my favorite albums. The score for this film was extrodinary and the original music performed by Deborah Lurie was absolutely gorgeous.The top 5 songs of the soundtrack:1. ""It's Alright"" by Peace Out featuring Chris Logan (Black Sabbath cover)2. ""Tim's Song"" - Deborah Lurie3. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" - Postal Service4. ""Baby Hold On"" - Nina Khoury5. ""Waterfall"" - I-94This is the very best cover of ""It's Alright"" I've ever heard. Guns N Roses tried it once but this one is slightly better. It's a beautiful song and was a fantastic choice for this movie. The lyrics and overall sound of the song fit the story and pace of the music perfectly. So kudos to them for choosing to re-record it."
1,"Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."
2,I enjoyed this book a lot. It was difficult for me to put it down at times. The end of the book leaves you captivated. It makes you want to start the next book in the series as soon as possible.
1,"The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!"
2,This is a great album with many catchy tunes. Listenable from start to finish and a great primer into SCOTS.
2,"how is that vista series can put together so many extra features, and not put on the trailer? It would be interesting to see how the studio advertised this movie when it came out back in '88. Other than that, no complaints."
2,"Good electronic/ambient artist's very first CD,originally put out in 1991.Took me awhile to land a copy of this title.FSOL is strictly a duo,members are Garry Cobain and Brian Douglas.Really quite a piece of work here,that is IF you dig this genre.Tracks that I remember to my liking were ""Expander"",their inspiring single ""Papua New Guinea""(have seen this tune mentioned in magazine reviews and articles before),""1 To 8"" and ""Pulse State"".Should appeal to some fans of The Orb,Meat Beat Manifesto,Sky Lab and Chemical Brothers."
1,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story had no sense of direction. It seemed too badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were just adding more things as they went along, saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the married real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
2,"This keeps my coffee hot until I am done in the morning. I turn it on, go make coffee in the break room at work, set my mug down, and my coffee stays hot all morning."
2,"Pat and Mike is a lovely story of a star athlete, played by Katharine Hepburn, who is discovered by a sport's manager, Spencer Tracy. Hepburn's character realizes that she is going to be watched every minute of every day while in training. This companionship between athlete and manager finally turns to love.In Pat and Mike, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy again play opposite each other. Hepburn also gets to show off the skills in sports and physical agility, which she posesses in real life."
2,"""Robot Stories"" is a movie that includes within it, 4 stories; all having to do with a robot or some such A.I. technology. Each story focuses on a particular time period in life, beginning from birth and ending in death. The second story deals only with toy robots, but it's the most moving. It deals with a mother comming to accept the loss of her comatose son. Clay, the last story, was also very insightful and interesting. The old sculptor of the story struggles with his obligation to ""scan"" his brain for the sake of future generations having access to his knowledge or the dignity of a natural death.This is the kind of science fiction that I love and hope to see more of. It's sci-fi that works to bring out the humane, using it to contrast and make the human experience ""pop"" to dramatize it to the limit without becoming contrived. ""Robot Stories"" is a wonderful collection of stories spanning a life of experiences."
1,"I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."
2,"This is by far the way Batman should be portrayed in the movies. I have been waiting to see a movie that shows Batman(Bruce Wayne) the way he should be; dark, mysterious, and real. This is that movie. This movie is so real; you can just see this really happening in real life. Christian Bale has the look, feal, and acting ability to be Batman and Bruce Wayne. He plays the part with such dedication and strength. The villains in the film are realistic as well. No cheesy villains like in the Spider-Man movies. The Scarecrow is frightening and well done. Even though he is a little underdeveloped, but it still works, because it is a movie about Bruce Wayne!!Even the Tim Burton films lack what Batman is really about. If you watch the first Batman movie now you will see that it is cheesy, like the corny Joker. They have their moments but are mostly cheesy, campy, and unrealistic. Not this new film. I just hope they (Nolan, Goyer, Bale) make many many more."
2,"Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. Their mix of heavy techno and heavy alternative rock makes this band unique and special..oh yes by the track on this CD. Very good CD, Garbage is original and great to rock out to and also to mellow out to...buy the CD!"
2,"This game was fun when I got it I was looking forward to getting home and getting started and straight away you will notice that the graphics for this game are great I mean I thought that (and sorry if I spoil it for anyone)and the voices are really hard to tell the difference from the real cast ( but I do think the voice of barbossa was here not sure)I also thought that the battle seens where there are those real fast sword clashes were great.Faults:well trying to use your gun and throwing knives is impossible to aim even with a area filled with enemys.also flashing from character to character was a little annoying but at times it was fun.Overall:well a good thing about this game is that it isn,t a simple button masher it actually has a lot of combos such as being able to punch and throw them around I esplcially like the ability to knee people in the nuts so it was really fun. but with very minor faults no game is perfect"
1,"You would have to be dead to not be touched by the stories in the book, but I found Mr. Brokaw's writing style a bit dry. The writing ended up sucking the life out of the stories."
2,"I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones."
1,"I do think the author has a valid message. Too many runners run without enough attention to their form. Unfortunately the book is overflowing with self-reported testimonials litered throughout. The constant repetition of what the author perceives to be core messages will insult your intelligence. It caused me great pain to try to avoid skipping entire pages for fear of missing an important message. The author is trying to sell way too hard, which makes for an unpleasurable reading experience. It left me with an aftertaste of having read an infomercial for a DVD, website and training courses. My recommendation to the autor: read Steven King's ""On writing"". The current form of writing must be be limiting the success of this book -preventing it from realizing its true potential. I cannot recommend it."
2,"I honestly don't know what Amazon reviewer Jaan Uhelszki has against Clay. If anything, this album is definitely NOT a boy-band sound-alike. Clay's style is somewhat hard to define as he goes against the ""pop"" styled music which seems to dominate the radio these days. He's very smooth with a powerful voice - my favorite track is ""This Is The Night"" - very emotional and tender. He's a nice guy who's in a very tough business and there are those who don't like him because he was ""made for TV"" - which is utter nonsense. His music is a welcome and soothing relief - a breath of fresh air, if you will. You will enjoy this album - guaranteed."
1,"I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep."
1,"I guess it's my own fault for not really reading the description, but this thing is TINY. Was fun enough but the kids (3 & 4) figured out which tooth was the ""bad"" one after @ 30 seconds of playing with it. Not worth the money."
2,"The song selection from these three cds is excellent.What a steal to get three of Billy's cds for less than four bucks!Yes, his Russia tour was precedent setting at the time. Yet, for me, the coolest thing is that a pianist in my family bought the actual grand piano that Billy used in this Russian concert tour. And believe me, it has it's own magic still!"
2,This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. It's about time they made a horror movie with strong female leads that doesn't degrade them or use them as eye candy dangled in front of a sadistic killer.This movie had a lot of layers to its characters and the creatures were freaking scary!
1,"Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
1,"DEAD!!!! to long before i use it,they wont take it, dont know what else to say dont know what else to say"
2,"The book CARIBES is the second in a series of six books by Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa. The first book being, CIENFUEGOS I, which was an exceptional book that I couldn't put down once I began reading it. The tradition follows with CARIBES, although not as exciting as the first book, this book continues to entertain and makes you laugh, as well as giving you factual knowledge about the discovery of the ""new world."" Highly recommended. I just wish that Amazon had all six books (cienfuegos, caribes, montenegro, azabeche, xaragua - and one more that I can't remember off hand)."
1,"the shape of these is so weird. no eyebrow has that shape. it's ok at removing hair. it has to be long for it to come completely of, doesn't work well on the little hairs"
1,The drive lasted 3 days before the flash fell off and was lost from the encasement. The encasement was examined and appeared to be flimsy plastic. I don't recommend this product based on a lost unit.
1,"I tried this product, noticed absolutely no difference in the appearance in my skin, wrinkles or anything else, just saying"
2,"This wooden maze puzzle is a good exercise in problem solving. The child has to figure out how to move various vehicles out of the path of other vehicles in order to take each car, truck, ambulance, etc. to its home. My school kids enjoy using this puzzle because it is different from the puzzles they typically complete."
2,This is a great movie lots of action and intrege. Being the third movie in the series i was afraid it was gonna be a flop but it was a great movie after all.
2,Keeps Coffee Almost As Hot As When Poured From Coffee Pot.I like mine piping hot. I'm picky. This does keep it almost that hot though.Nice Long Cord (Over 5 Feet)Off/On Switch Conveniently Located On Coaster Front.Four Grip Feet On Bottom. Doesn't Burn Surface Of Table. Doesn't Slide Around.Good Buy!
2,"I was in the process of getting rid of a few old cds to make room for new ones. This got my attention since i did not play it that much when i first got it. The fact that this has Nguyen Le on guitar sort of sends this to dynamic, electrified and 'swing & be bop'' influenced territory. I know some of Fresu's work tends to be a bit calm. And although there are contemplative pieces here the 'fast' ones are the ones that really catch your attention as they are played SO well. Kept my attention all the way through. Eclectic, European 'Ecm - tinged' and very slight fusion tracings makes for a very interesting and joyful listening experience. Excellent sound too! Guess i won't be selling this one any time soon."
1,"Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
1,"This album is able to be previewed in full on NME.com If I were you I would go there to find out just what you're about to endure. This album sucks extremely bad. I have not heard anything this half assed in all but two weeks. This garbage getting good reviews is only an indication of the white reviewers out there trying to make this seem cooler than it isn'nt. The beats are exactly the same on every track. Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record. This is what bad pop music will sound like in ten years. MIA has recorded a travesty ahead of her time. Once again, go to NME.com and preview this before you actully waste your money on this. The sound of this record could have been reproduced with a kettle drum and sticks banging together in a long hall."
2,"A refreshing account of the 96 Mountain Madness Everest expedition from a women who must command respect from the mountaineering world. This book is an inspiration to those who follow their dreams, and go beyond just setting goals in life, regardless of what that may be. A MUST read for anyone who's read Into Thin Air, The Climb, or The Other Side of Everest. I'd recommend catching one of her bookstore appearances as well!"
1,"This video only maintained my daughter's attention for about a minute (if that)! I found it to be pretty boring actually. There's hardly any talking, there is no music, and 'Eebee' and the lady do the same things over and over, so it gets boring after about the third time they do something (i.e. pouring cheerios out of a long container). I wish there was more talking/interaction or at least some music."
1,"Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it's so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher's performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher."" In short, you'll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums."
2,"Many years ago, this was a popular,horrible event. Just wanted to read it again as an older person so see if my images had changed of the book."
1,"After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Although I have a reasonably fast PC 3.06 Ghz and a fair video display, the game is slow and jerky and it crashes or hangs up constantly. Having played all the TR games this is by far the worst. I will be trying to get my money back on this one. If you haven't already bought it don't waste your time or your money."
1,"I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
2,"This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me."
1,"if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring..."
1,"I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."
1,Don't like most of these movies; description inadequate so I didn't have a way to know what type of movies were on it.
2,"I am a huge fan of Sergio Castellitto, and as a frequent visitor to Southern Italy I wanted to learn more about the life of Padre Pio. Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed this film very much, in much the same way that I enjoy visiting churches in Italy. A surprisingly good, interesting film, that grabbed my interest until it ended nearly four hours later! I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Southern Italian culture."
2,"I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. The dome is very solid to protect desserts but also fits nicely (and heavily) onto the base, keeping things fresh at room temperature. Highly recommended!"
1,"Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
1,"...I liked ""12 Play"", but since then Kelly's gone down hill, his sound is radio saturated, he needs have a different sound or something else...maybe a different producer, some other songwriters or sompin'--I ain't kidding either. Maybe a trip to Kathmandu or Tibet will help. I thought that the single was alright, but this leaves a lot to be desired especially that Cheesy ""Strip for You"". Pul-leeze. Just buy a replacement ""12-Play"" CD..."
1,"We bought this item twice. The first time, it was defective and wouldn't work (it made a dull sound all the time, and no additional sound at all when put in contact with water, as per the test described on the instructions sheet), so we returned it to Amazon (thanks for your excellent returns policy!) for an exchange. When the 2nd item proved just as defective, we got our money back. Don't waste your money on this junk -- buy something more expensive and substantial."
2,"As a smallville fan, i find this DVD box set excellent, but i would like in the fuiture to find more episodes commented by the actors or the crew, and what happend with the webisodes that use to have smallville, like the chloe chronicles, or somethings like that."
2,I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it.
1,"""Invisible"" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:""If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight"" and ""I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make"". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."
2,"I have never read a book with such power to haunt, to inspire. Till We Have Faces held me spellbound the first time I read it, and it's power has done nothing but increase with each re-reading. There are thoughts expressed here, thoughts that perhaps each of us have known on the flickering edge of our consciousness, but have never known to put into words. This book is incredible in the way that it matches gritty realism with a soaring myth, and make the myth so much more powerful because it becomes real. Reading this powerful book will change you."
2,For one that want understand a little more about karate this book could be a great help. Well written and a soft read.
1,"I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with ""Y"" and don't what to start from ""A"" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to ""Y"" but want to scroll up from ""Z"" to ""Y"", you can't."
1,"I don't understand is this book made of gold or gasoline? Why the hell does it cost sooo much? Does the author David Moody come to your home and actually read the book to you? When you order this book do you get 25 copies? I have many more questions about this book, but I don't wish or want to waste my time. Hope this review helps, maybe when I get back from overseas, get out of the military, sell my home or first born just maybe I will be able to afford such a luxurious book. This explains why the local library doesn't have the book."
2,Another book I read as a young man and dismissed. The book is so spot on. The difference is people tend to be obsessed with PDAs not walls in their homes.
1,"I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better."
1,You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY.The Amish are the most backwards group of misfits I have ever encountered.Where kids beat on when you were they? Were wives talked down to and belitted? Were animals beat and starved? I thought not. Maybe you should take another trip...and tell it like it really is. I do not think much of your book. It is NOT TRUE
2,"We used swaddlers for the first couple months, then switched to baby dry. Thanks to Amazon, pampers are cheaper then the store brand! I have tried them all, and always came back to pampers. Baby dry works just as well as cruisers and swaddlers, but are cheaper and super soft. They are lightly scented which I love. My son has had no problems with rash or leaking. Highly recommend!"
2,"I recently discovered this band while surfing the net.I sampled a few songs off their website,and I really loved Bemoaned Animosity.I wasn't sure if I'd like them that much,but wow was I wrong.Their tagline says it all,Death Trash Chaos!This cd has got to be one of my favorites,an instant classic for me.I find it difficult to compare them to other bands,as they have their own sound.My sister chuckled when she heard the name of the cd,but after she heard the title track,she was hooked and loves it as much as I do.It's certainly heavy,but blends thrash and death metal so well that I never really notice,cause I'm to busy head bangin'!"
1,"Okay, some of the reviews said that this was better than the Exorcist (if that was humanly possible), and it wasn't. After seeing the Exorcist, no other scary movie compares. This had an easy plot to follow, lots of chanting, and a bunch of crazy witches saying Hail Satan! The scariest part of this movie is the FBI warning at the beggining. I gave it two stars for the opening song, but other than that skip it. Almost as stupid as The Other. Not The Others, The Other. The Exorcist is way better, and I'm not a die hard Exorcist fan, The Exorcist is simply the Scariest movie ever, because demonic possesion is very real. I was ""privleged"" to witness one, and I still have nightmares to this day. This is another dumb anti-christ movie. The only good one was The Omen. Skip this and rent The Exorcist or The Omen."
2,"I am very conservative when shelling out $$$ for new CDs and decided that Clay Aiken's premier CD was worth buying new. Now I find myself playing it over and over again. Three of the tracks stand out for me (Measure of a Man, Run to Me,I Survived You). I like all of the others, though one track has weak music/lyrics in my opinion(still, Aiken does an admirable job it). One of the best reviews I heard of Clay Aiken, by one of the guest AI judges, is that when he sings a song, he makes it his own. Clay has a sound like no one else and this CD has not disappointed me. I look forward to enjoying this CD for many years."
2,"Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment."
2,"For $6.00, this shirt is great. Yes, it is thin, but it looks absolutely fine. I have the ecru and wear an undershirt."
2,"This picture book has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. The pages are spread by the breaks in text that we know from reciting the pledge orally at school. Children are from different races. Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given. Facts about the American flag's changes over the years and facts about the proper way to display a flag, and on what days, are included.A beautiful book with great information that every child should be exposed to."
2,This is quite simply one of the very best live albums ever. Plain and simple!
2,"I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
2,"It may be a five,but I won't actually get another ride in this year. The seat looks great, shipped fast and was easy to install. It certainly is heavier than the stock seat and wider with more back support."
1,My eight year old son came home with this and after reading a little I took it away from him. This is the kind of stuff that warps minds and is only appropriate for those already warped. There are plenty of those.Make sure your kids don't read this untill they are older. Its all about killing and screaming in a tour of hell.
2,"Clay's debut album is an awesome album. It does not show his range but it indeed showcases his amazing voice. Definitely a #1 album for Clay! And this is only the beginning. One of my favorite on the album is ""When You say you love me"" co-written by Enrique Iglesias. That's interesting.GO GET IT! It's well worth it!"
1,"Although the movie was very well done for those who enjoyed a spooky and suspenseful story, the book however is not the movie. It seems that Hollywood took very few pieces from the book and turned it in to a great movie which is kind of the other way around from the usual book being better than the movie. This book is good if your a UFO buff only. It mentions the Mothman but other than that it was a very boring read as I expected to be reading about the same scenario as what I saw in the movie. I was extremely disappointed."
1,"The cover and description of the book do not express that Les Carter and Frank Minirth are really only interested in appealing to Christians or people who want to convert to Christianity. I look to books like this for scientific reasoning, but was greatly put off when it started quoting Jesus on page 11 (after prompting the reader to complete workbook questions on previous pages therefore making the book unreturnable.) Anyway, I think it's a shame the authors do not put ""For Christians Only"" on the cover so at least their book would only end up in the hands they intended."
1,"Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch ""The House On Haunted Hill"" (1999) or ""Thir13een Ghosts"" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"
1,i was pretty exited until i found out that the delivery guy left it on the ground its accuraye is terrible its battery last 5 min. and i just think it was a waste of my money
2,"A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."
1,"Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
1,"For those who doubt the user, be assured this printer does have paper feed problems. Some users have good experiences but it the problem lies in the printer. I have been a network consultant for 10 years and I fix all the computer hardware problems for my company. This printer feed problem is not something that can be fixed by reading the manual. For your information, I am using HP Color Inkjet paper. It printed a few pages fine in the beginning then started jamming on every single sheet. I have to manually help it along by pushing each page for it to catch the paper. Sometimes it just grabs a stack of 30 sheets. It has a poor paper pick up design and that is a fact."
2,"This was a present for my grandma, she loves it, nuff said. Not my type of music, but hey as long as she is happy."
2,"Cher is such an amazing actress. This movie always makes me feel good and optimistic. Each time I watch it, often w aversion who is seeing it for the first time, I find something new to love about it."
1,"About 30% of the time this printer will actually recognize that it does, in fact, have paper in the feed tray; often paper needs to be fed by hand. It also jams about 50% of all paper that goes through it. You cannot simply tell the computer to print a document and walk away from it; you have to sit there the entire time, feeding individual pieces of paper into the printer and pulling out the jams one by one. Also don't even think about running it without both ink cartridges. When my color cartridge ran out, I let it go because I don't do a lot of color printing. HP apparently really wants me to go out and buy another fifty-dollar cartridge because in all honesty about every two seconds during a print job (between the constant paper jam and lack of paper in tray messages) I received a pop-up telling me that I needed a color cartridge.I think I'll go back to Canon."
2,"I haven't sat down to watch the movie yet, but I thought I would take another look at the source material.Well, it is still a great book. The only thing is that it has been ripped off by so many other franchises.The only problem with the book is Burroughs insistence on creating as many alien races as he can. The amount often becomes bewildering, and this is a problem that a lot of his other work had. I remember becoming lost when reading the people that time forgot - there seemed to be so many creatures and races, that I couldn't keep up.Still, there is a lot to admire in this book, and you will be very entertained by it."
1,"Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product."
1,What happened with Ozzy and Co? Man this is a classic from the 70's...! a gem from Black Sabbath's vol 4 and I can't understand why Ozzy and Co (Sharon Obsbourne of course) can take a song like this to ruin and destroy it like a pop trash on the voice of this little stupid girl called Kelly (yes with Ozzy but ...) And all for money.If you want to hear the real thing go for Vol 4!
1,"This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours."
1,"Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music."
1,"I don't understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces. It should just be one piece. The 2 pieces are held together with a small piece of double sided tape and COMPLETELY fall apart after 1 day of walking. No problem with seller, this is just a HORRIBLY made product."
1,This is more like example code than what I'd expect out of a textbook. I would recommend another book instead.
1,This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
1,"This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable."
1,"I bought this because I thought it would keep me entertained at work. It did- for about 5 minutes. The games are VERY easy, I beat them quickly, but you can only play three times a day then you can't collect any more NPs, so there's no point. And you can't manipulate the clock to make the game think it's the next day. I'm just going to keep playing until I can get my rare item code, but I was very disappointed in the game, I thought Neopets could do better."
2,"Pam has NO idea what is making Lighting act very strangly. She gets bucked out of the saddle,refuses to eat, and doesn't listen. Will Pam have to give up her pony, or is some seriously wrong with Lighting?? Read to find out!! I LOVE this book VERY,VERY much!!!"
2,"In this unique conbination of biography, commentary, & devotional, Arthur Pink offers an intimate view of the many sides of David. The shepherd, the soldier, the king and the sinner are revealed in a way that cuts to the heart of life's greatest problems."
2,"This movie is very fun and entertaining. It does slow down quite a bit at times developing the subplots, but even two solid hours of nothing but action would get monotonous and boring.It explores the bravery, sacrifice, and even politics exemplified by so many in so many wars. In this case it is WWI. It is the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, among the very first fighter pilots, as they take on the Germans. There is lots of action, great cinematography, a good plot, and a love story as well.Despite any inaccuracies with the aircraft in this movie, it is nothing that a non-expert would notice. The flying scenes may be CGI, but it is done very well. A very enjoyable movie."
1,"Because the first time you watch it will undoubtly be your last as well. Overall I believed I was going to be watching a movie loosely based on the life of Kurt Cobain leading up to his death.Instead what I was ""graced"" with is Blake (Kurt) sitting in a creek, sitting by the lake, sitting against a door and so on and so on. Half the time you're just looking at a still object with no characters on screen. There was a plot somewhere in there too but with all the MUMBLING you might miss it. Not to mention that there isn't that much dialogue to begin with.I wouldn't recommend this movie to Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fans.This movie bored me tears, I barely finished it."
2,Beautifully written. The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century.
2,"I really enjoyed Dead du Jour. It's a classic multi-murder mystery with a smart, interesting female protagonist. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who is a professor in North Carolina and who works for the police in Canada. The setting changes between Canada and North Carolina, which gives a nice variety of outside influences on the plot (ice storms in Canada, a swampy monkey island in NC). There is a love angle between Brennan and a Canadian detective, Ryan (Will they or won't they?!) There is an interesting subplot about the bones of a nun that the Church wants Brennan to dig up and analyze. If you read the first novel in the Brennan series, you will certainly like this novel--it's even better. Brennan gets along with people better in this novel, there is the love interest with Ryan, and the annoying Claudel from the first novel is barely in this story. After reading this book, you'll want to go and get the next book in the series."
1,"My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag."
2,"I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies."
2,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."
2,"The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way.."
2,"I've had this clock for several years now, and it's always worked fine for me. I'm a bit nearsighted, so the extra large numbers and the fact that it lights up when it goes off is very helpful, not to mention I can pick it up and hold it in front of my face without ripping out wires. Sometimes (in some places) it does take a while to get a signal from Colorado but for the most part it's never been an issue. The screen has stayed bright on mine, only dims a little when the battery is about to die. I've only had to replace the batteries once. Nice snooze and travels well too.One hint - if you need to replace the AA batteries, the easiest way I could get off the cover (brute force didn't work) was to put a piece of tape on the back cover and pull sideways. Hopefully they fixed this on the newer versions so that it's easier to open."
2,"This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint."
2,"Maybe G.G. Marquez's style is a little bit confusing. Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or ""Christ versus Arizona"" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."
1,Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.
1,"I have always liked Julie Garwood (until the Roses). But this book is pretty lame. It has echoes of her past style, but is vastly inferior. The first few chapters were so confusing that I checked to see if pages were missing from my book. I tried hard to like it, but how many times can you read: Brodick; Yes Judith; Gillian; Yes Brodick; Ian; Yes Ramsey; Did Ms Garwood need some filler? No one talks that way. I was quite disappointed, but read it anyway."
1,"There is handicap and deadly disease, poverty, alcoholism, loss of a parents during childhood and super abusive mother. All that topped off with great love and forgiveness. Little bit overdone even for my (romantic) taste."
1,"we ordered these as part of a Halloween costume.It is very very flimsy and is literally falling apart after only a few minutes out of the box...While it is ""light and safe"" as per another reviewer's comment, kids will want to mimic sword fighting. With these, they seem to break just by lightly swinging them around."
1,"A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
1,DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
2,"Director Susanne Bier, Best Screenplay writers Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, Best Actor Rolf Lassgrd, Best Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, and a few other supporting and camera work nominations would not surprise me. I will be disappointed if they are not rewarded for the talent and intelligence evident in this film. After the Wedding is so honestly human that it does indeed break your heart. Happily it also hands you hope, a little laughter, and moments of tender warmth and love."
2,"This is terrific stuff. Southern California is a college with the first or second greatest college football tradition of all times, and this book describes how, after a long layoff, Pete Carroll has returned the Trojans to these previous heights."
2,"This is a wonderful book about farm life in the 1950's, written from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, called here Dick. He does all the things farm kids did in those days. He fakes sickness so he can be home when the new tractor drives in the lane, rides the cows, makes pets of everything, falls in the creek. His dad farms on the contour and the neighbors think he is crazy. Lois was in the habit of visiting the homes of children in whatever part of the country she wrote about, got to know the kids by staying with them a spell, and then wrote about them. I highly recommend all the Lois Lenski regional books."
1,"This movie is so tasteless, that it scares me that even one person gave it a good review. I mean come on, a pig nosed commando(yeah right) and a bunch of accomplices who would have trouble successfully making toast are gonna infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure and wreak havoc with the Aids virus? Asnd they are thwarted no less than by a bunch of air crash survivors who have to screw each other before they can muster up the guts to stop this evil plot. Oh man this is bad!"
2,"I used to think that there was no strategy, per se, to fishing a lake--a big tub of water you trolled until you got an arbitrary hit.This book takes an almost forensic view of a lake's features--water layers, vegetation, etc.--and shows how to read them and catch fish. It's much more detailed than I expected and I came away with a real sense of how to find trout as quickly as possible."
2,"I am a part of those ""deeply-out-of-it"" who recognize great music from this most remarkable man. No, I don't fit in any of those demographics but I am head-over-heels in love with The Voice and The Man. He's not a sell-out, he stayed true to his convictions and we get an album that I enjoyed very, very much.I love ""The Way"", ""MOAM"", ""Perfect Day"" and ""WYSYLM"".BUY THIS AND BE PART OF THE REVOLUTION."
1,"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."
1,"I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling. I think it's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano, instead."
1,interesting and well worth a read but difficult with the old English at times and tends to be long winded and rambles somewhat
1,I was disappointed to find this was a children's version of the Jules Verne novel. Amazon's description of it doesn't make this clear.
2,"This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won't move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal."
1,"We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box."
1,"I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. However, this one is my least favorite. The actress who plays Emma rather grated on my nerves and I did not enjoy her performance at all. I would not recommend this one."
2,My daughter used to read Amelia Bedelia books and LOVED them! I bought these for her daughter (my granddaughter) who also loves them and is learning to read. They are funny and silly books with good morals.
1,"I bought my Tivo Series 2 about 16 months ago and also paid $300 for a 3 year term of Tivo service. About 2 months ago, the hardware stopped working and I called Tivo. They told me that the warranty had expired and that I was on my on to buy a new one (no discounted replacement). So I bought a second series 2 at full price, and then recently found out that it is not supported by the NetFlix movies on demand service. Tivo told me that I could upgrade to a Tivo HD but, again, I would have to do this at full price. So the bottom line is that Tivo doesn't provide any discounted upgrade options for customers. The lesson I've learned from this is to abandon Tivo and just get a PC for video on demand and video recording."
2,"When I got this CD (as a gift, I was really into ""Tubthumping""), I was very afraid that much of the rest of the CD would be garbage. I was very wrong. These guys (and gals) are more talented than anyone seems to give them credit for. There's something for everyone on this CD."
1,"This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you."
1,"Do not buy if using for standard, 3-pronged, U.S. home outlets. It has an additional prong on the side that made it not compatible with my room AC."
1,"1. Its seems like the company wants to get your money by getting you to buy more balls. I say this because it comes with only a handful, which kills the nostalgia of a 'ball pit'. It costs about $25 for 100 extra balls...so add that to the cost if you expect an actual ballpit. (note: ever ball pit toy I bought only comes with a handfull of balls.)2. The pieces dont quite fit right when fully connected3. It does not stand up well"
2,"I read this book both in english and in my language version. I've been moved by the truth behind this tragical story. I hate George. He thought he owns his friend's life, the friend who would never hurt him nothing for god's sake. If it turned out that he remained his whole life working in the ranch and spent his fifty bucks a month in whore house, it was because he did it for himself."
2,"Just shut your traps for a moment. It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made ""Dimension Hatross"" a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, ""Negatron"" is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace."
1,Boring and bland. He even spent two pages listing sponges. Don't waste your time by reading this.
2,This was a very nice surprise. It is very good quality. My little grandpuppy cockerpoo looks adorable in it.
1,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long-long time. The plot is very unimaginative, and is active is plain horrible.There isn't much more to say."
2,"was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50.8 version. Thus far it feels good and i would definately recommend the use of this product"
1,"Water begins leaking out of the hole in the bottom almost as soon as you start feeding the doll, so be sure to have a diaper on. The Born brand diapers cost more per diaper than regular baby diapers and cannot be reused. Once they get wet, they must be thrown out. It would be better to make your own. My three year old daughter was horribly disappointed by the ""baby food"" which looked like water with small white particles floating in it. At least you can submerge the baby for a bath. It looks cute. It does come with a potty, but is not anatomically correct, so it may or may not be useful for potty training, depending on your child."
2,"Love this movie!1.) Emotion...The movie has some characters you will love and cheer for, and some you will hate.2.) Twists....The movie has a couple of turns that are unpredictable for sure. Without giving them away, this isn't a movie that just starts, tells one plain story, and ends.3.) Great acting/powerful...You get the feeling that you're watching a real life story play out.One of my favorite movies, and when I started watching it, I didn't even think I'd like it. Give it a try!"
2,This book was in very good condition and I received it in a very timely manner.
1,"I purchased this pampers and I was giving it a try based on the reviews. After using the pampers for 3 weeks, my baby experienced Urinary Tract infection, and I don't know how it happened. I went to my family doctor and the doctor recommended changing the diaper to other brand.I did more research regarding Pampers Baby Dry and there is also lawsuit against pampers.In short, I would NOT use this brand again. It costs me headache and pain for my baby."
1,"Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake."
1,(I bought the pink nubuck shoes)these shoes are really really cute and they are comfortable BUT i sprayed them with nubuck protectant and thought i would be ok. i wore them and the parking lot was slightly wet with rain and the bottom of the shoe (around the edges of the sole) is REALLY faded. then my jeans touched the back of them and made weird marks on the back and i must have had 1 or 2 raindrops hit them and there are spots. only wear these indoors with no chance of anything touching them besides your feet on the inside of them. i wish they had been leather. i spent the money on them for one night because i wont ever wear them again.
2,"I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience."
2,"Its awesome. My parents were shocked at how much it gets right. I play it all the time. It doesn't know its self though. i tried. so far it knowed giraffe, butterfly, french fry, playstation2, computer. (i just got it the other day) its astounding! wow! BUY IT IF U WANT A GOOD TOY!"
2,"I was amazed by this book: The author, while travelling from Central America to Canada provides evidence for North America being colonized by Egyptians, Chinese, Phoenecians and other ancient civilizations. The most amazing part of the book was the story of an Egyptian city in the Grand Canyon. Childress reproduces the actual Arizona newsclippings from 1909. Like his other books, this one is richly illustrated, far-out and fun to read!"
1,The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money
1,"What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on?"
1,"Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."
1,After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
1,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."
2,This was Bradbury's best book. He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed.
2,Stacie Orrico is a good singer. She has a God given talent. Even though her ways have changed she always has the ability to sing.
2,"Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's ""The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more. This book has stood the test of time and helped thousands of people, I'm glad to say that I'm one of them."
2,"Lisa has been a long time associate of mine and for someone who has been using Kettlebells for many years, Lisa's DVD is one of the MOST helpful and effective instructional video for those with multiple experience with Kettlebells from those who are new to KB's to those of us who have molded our fitness programs after Kettlebells. Thank you Lisa for continueing to put out great fitness info to the community! You're a gem in the fitness world! Keep up the great work!BenYou can also follow Lisa on YouTube, just run a search for Kettlebell Bombshell or Lisa Balash.BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't look a thing like Audrey Hepburn. I truely believe that the producers and casting directors made a terrible call casting Hewitt. The actress who I believe reminds people of Audrey as well as looks like her is Natalie Portman (who is an exceptional actress). Natalie would have made a much mcuh better Audrey Hepburn.
1,After the first 30 minutes of senseless violence and stilted dialogue I could not bear to watch the rest of this film.
2,"Oscar nominee DIANE LANE shines in this wonderful comedy about changing your life for the better after a devastating blow. The film is wonderfully made, very funny, very sexy, and beautiful to look at. The scenery is breathtaking and the acting by DIANE LANE is tremendous. This is a very, VERY highly recommended film and the DVD looks like it has some cool extras as well! 5 stars!"
2,"Christopher Chant decends from enchanters and sorceresses. Yet the only thing that is magical about Christopher is his dreams. At night, he travels into The Place Between. From there he goes into the Anywheres, where he meets mysterious people who give him mysterious gifts. Christopher is perfectly content until his father takes him to Dr. Pawson to find out way he can't do magic. After that he is sent to Chrestomanci Castle to become the world's next Chrestomanci. He hates it there! Will Christopher ever survive?"
1,"Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
1,dose not keep coffee hot a step above ice cold I was very disappointed I though since it was a Mr. coffee it would be what I wanted wouldn't not buy again.
1,"When you order a Tivo with a one-year service term, Tivo promises to send you an e-mail 30 days prior to the end of the year before charging your credit card. Well, I never received an e-mail from Tivo, and customer ""service"" refused to issue a refund after I discovered the charge. Remember, you're not just buying a DVR, you're buying a service. Tivo's service sucks. Period."
1,"I usually get Pampers BAby dry from Amazon for my son. And I always have been happy with this product, but not at this time. Surprisingly When I started to use product from this box for night time. It was leaking. At first I could not understand how this happen, because I always used this product before and never had any incident like that. Even though I was changing my son extra time during night and diaper was not really full, he would ended up in the wet bed. I realized it leaks when he sleeps on the side, but it not suppose to happen. I guess I just got defective box. I bought pampers cruisers for overnight use, and used baby dry only for day time. It is sad, but at this time the quality of product was not what I expected."
1,Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally
2,"It's nice to finally have many of these remixes in one place, including many I had not heard before. Despite these songs being from many different genres and times, they flow together like liquid butter! The new Thievery song ""Originality"" is a slamming reggae jam that will liven up your party in the coming months. Imagine today's young people getting down to The Doors, courtesy of Thievery's ""Strange Days"" remix. Elsewhere, there are plenty of songs to spin, no matter your mood. This is not just some knockoff package till Thievery can deliver another studio album - this is a full fledged musical work!On another note, it's nice to know that Thievery is embracing the beauty of album packaging, with another first rate package here to go along with ""The Cosmic Game"" and ""Richest Man in Babylon."" Even though CD sales are going the way of the passenger pigeon, it's nice to browse through such an elaborate package, which can then enhance the entire listening experience."
1,"I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."
2,every year i purchase this perfume for my mom and i always had to pay ateast $50.00 for the 3.3oz bottle until i found the 8oz for a cheaper price here my mom loves it plus free shiping it is great
1,"I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
1,"I use Pampers for my kids for more than 3 years.. I always liked them, until few months ago.. I thought maybe a packages wasn't good, and then I see it again and again...1 out of 10 diapers is falling apart... ""wings"" are come off, when you try to put diaper on!!!I don't want to buy Pampers again.... :("
1,"I ordered this video for my granddaughter, all of the movies i have ordered from Amazon I never knew that you could not view them if they were from region 2. I guess I have been just lucky when odering videos. I never knew about this region 2. I was so upset that I didn't even want to return the video. You people should only sell videos that are able to be watched on all dvd players it was a waste of my time and money. I am not sure if I will buy videos from amazon again or not and I was a very faithful customer."
2,I have personally used this edition of the Psalms for quite a while. Because I enjoy it so much I have purchased several copies for friends
2,I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail.
1,"Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy. This movie is great, but DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION, unless you want a DVD that doesn't work. They really need to fix this problem."
2,"Once you try it,you will be spoiled for anything else. It saves on storage.After programing you watch at your convenience & delete or save for another time. Tivo is one of the greatest inventions."
1,"To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."
2,"Too Short is the Ultimate PIMP - If you like this album check out Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1 - from his homie Devin the Dude another 5 Stars"
1,"This is an obscenely derivative album which basically amounts to some not very talented people revamping Mrs Gallagher's record collection and passing it off as their own. If only they'd been American, maybe someone would have called the lawyers and done away with this formulaic, monotone drivel.I would suggest you go back to the search box and look up the original artists instead - T Rex, The New Seekers and,of course, The Beatles. Also recommended is R.E.M.s 'The Wake-Up Bomb' which derides them nicely."
2,My husband and I have come to love this show. It is very appropriate for children too. It is so funny and the story line is really well put together. I highly highly recommend.
1,"I was slightly disappointed in this book, knowing it was a Zane Gray. The storyline is a love story, but the author dwells more on his views and tries to usealot of words to explain the surroundings. The physical dimensions of thebook was too large & bulky. Again, if your interest is in love stories, thenyou might enjoy this book."
2,"At the end of the movie, their is the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble (Amazon.com sells the other two shorts on VHS) I noticed that the entire cartoon was discolored slightly. If this is what ""Digital Restoration"" is than I want no part of it. They take the crisp, sharp colors and dull them down! does this make any sence?"
2,"I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last! They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations."
2,"I have had excellent experience with Pampers since our now two year old (26 pounds) was a preemie (3 pounds 15 ounces). The Baby Dry are just another example of the excellent quality diaper Pampers provides no matter what the size of your child. Our daughter does have a slender shape (little hips and butt) and these diapers have held in everything until she started moving around more (which is when we switched to Cruisers). We have also only experience two diaper rashes (very minimal) while using Pampers. I have tried Huggies and Seventh Generation and Kirkland, but Pampers has consistently worked the best for our daughter over the last two years."
1,"I have not received the item that I bought. I amjust waiting for some extra days in order to send a claim or a complain.Rgrds,Xavier Arderiu"
2,Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic tale of loyalty and friendship. It is about two friends name George Milton and Lennie Small who are a couple of laborers going from job to job. Both share a common dream of owning some land and being treated fairly. It was well written and I enjoyed reading it very much. I recommend it to everyone.
2,"Brian Weiss ha dejado una magnifica guia para quienes no tienen mucha informacion acerca del Hipnotismo, La historia de Katerine es tan impresionante que podria ayudar a culquier persona que se ha hecho la pregunta mas de una vez sobre la continuidad de la vida."
2,"Maybe it's because drum machine and sampler technology caught up with them...or maybe that Martin was in an especially sultry mood. Masses marks the moment Depeche Mode really find their second incarnation, consolidating the successes of Black Celebration, moving from industrial clang to sultry slink. Thank god for the Emulator and digital synths, because the boys put them to very good effect here. And David Bascombe's production rounds out a great collection of thematically connected songs. (They're all about the sex drive and its dull motivations, boys and girls). The only thing more impressive would be what follows: an astonishingly perfect synthpop album...or is it rock album?...called Violator."
2,"For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it."
1,"I finally put myself in front of the thing, and listened, and I raelly wanted to enjoy it even though I figured I wouldn't. And my instincts were right - this is nothing but pop pablum, and not even well sung or well produced pop pablum.Musically it is totally uninsteresting - all hooks and psuedo-poppish melodic lines that fail to compel me in any way whatsoever. I was happy when the music ended.If one must listen to pop music (and I'd suggest that you please expand your musical horizons) you can do way, way better than this guy.He really does follow in the footsteps of 'NStink and Backstreet Boys - continuing the flood of crap into mainstream America.Yuck!There is some (though very little) GOOD pop music. Not surprisingly, Clay Aiken is not it."
1,"Same story here! I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for a while before buying this after reading through the reviews. What a huge mistake! It never keeps my 4 month old baby dry, I have to keep changing it as soon as he pees. I'll never buy it again!!!"
1,"Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one."
2,This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
1,"The sound quality is so bad on this DVD that I am returning it. I was so surprised that MGM would release this DVD with such poor sound. It totally ruins the movie because you can't easily hear what the actors are saying. Also, the music is such an important part of this movie and is totally destoyed by the lousy sound which I would describe as tinny (equalized towards the upper frequencies). I also, have this movie on an old large laserdisk, and the sound is fantastic on that media."
1,This was a school assignment for my son. I read the book first so I could quiz him on it. It is in my top 5 of the worst books ever! Don't waste your time...unless it's a mandatory school assignment.
1,"My mother, who worked for Mike Murdock for about a year, passed away July 28, 2005. When I sent him a letter informing him that my mother had died he began to barrage me with all kinds of sales literature thanking me for writing him, with never a word of condolence. I sent him a second ""Personal and confidential"" letter and more of the same followed. In the second letter I asked him to stop mailing me but his mailing onslaught continues. Would Jesus conduct himself in this way?Upon checking Murdock out it seems he makes a lot of questionable claims and according to the IRS he does not give all the aid and help to other people that he claims he does.My mother had a bunch of his books, including this one, and when I started to go through them as I awaited Murdock's responce, they seem to go over the same basic ""secrets"" over and over again, in different combinations. I cannot recommend following someone who will not practice what he preaches!"
2,"While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. Sodom is one of those bands. The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal. Are they repeating themselves? Most likely, but I'd far rather listen to this material than any other ""metal"" being released by ""progressive, forward-thinking"" bands like Korn; turn up ""Addicted to Abstinence"" or ""Visual Buggery"" and forget nu-metal exists."
2,the warmer works as advertised. Keeps my mug warm. The shipping was delayed so much so that I contacted Amazon... but it did show up within the days Amazon told me.
2,"This overview of the trio's songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you already own 75% of the songs. Has rare mono mixes of Freda Payne's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Chairmen Of The Board's ""Give Me Just A Little More Time."" Informative liners notes."
1,"I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
1,"Basically a nice unit. Loaded with all the features you could ever want: plenty of optical zoom, digital stabilizer, very compact size, reasonable warranty, and good looks too.BUT...this camera has a VERY annoying buzzing/humming sound to it. I called Canon and they said it's ""normal for that unit."" Excuse me?Maybe for some people, the buzz is not annoying. But compared to my cheap, old 8mm, this is much, much noisier. I would recommend you try it before you buy it. Don't get wooed by the display models."
2,"1. O Holy Night2. Shepherd's Song3. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen4. The Christmas Song5. Peace on Earth6. Joy to the World7. A Star is Born8. O Little Town of Bethlehem9. Spirit of Christmas10. White ChristmasProduced by Phil Driscoll, Ken Pennell & Lari Goss"
1,"Even though it is free, and I appreciate that, there was about a chapter missing. I would suggest this either be fixed, or the book removed from sale."
2,The whole transaction went smoothly. Arrived within reasonable amount of time however have not had the time to watch the movie yet!
1,I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
2,"This film is one of the better of this genre--due to the casting, and the more ""true to life and literature"" approach that is taken. The characters seem much more ""human."" Enough sexual content, albeit well done, to preclude viewing by even teenagers. Homer's story is followed pretty faithfully, too, from my distant memories. But the real ""excellence"" is in the acting."
1,"I am still new to the horror movie genre, and maybe I'm a noob at this. But, seriously the movie is nowhere near good. Crispin Glover does what he does best, I can recognize his psychotic face from a mile away and still run like hell. But, the story line and the graphics quality was disappointing. The first few minutes watching the movie I thought ""This is not going to go well"" but then I realize the name Blake Lively on the cover and was relieved. ""Thank goodness"" I said, but then I sat through the whole movie only to see Blake enter 5 minutes in the end saying a few lines, looking hot as usual, and capiche. End of movie."
1,"The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
2,"Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, ""Clan of the Cave Bear "" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get."
2,Had a little trouble getting into the story to start but as the book progressed found myself finding it harder to put down - up to the last night when i could not go to bed without finishing first.Would look forward to other similar alternate history books by the same author
2,You need to view this like it was a new kind of Super Mario Brother's set and story. Like a More Modern Day Mario. I loved the sets and actors. And the script was a typical rescue the lady that didn't know she was a princes. Just put your nerdiness to the side and view it as a new kind of Mario and you will enjoy it.
1,"There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair."
2,"We use this on almost everything. It works great with Tofu, and also makes a very tasty and creamy pot pie when mixed with vegetables. The nutritional content makes it ideal for not just Vegans and Vegetarians, but all people who are looking to add flavor and remain health conscious.A very simple recipe that I use on a regular basis is to cut Firm Tofu into halves or quarters, squeeze the water out as much as possible. I then coat with Braggs Amino Acids, and yeast flakes. This gives it a very good texture and taste."
1,"I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
1,"my ac adapter broke down as well, the tip going into the computer simply fell out of the plastic plug. don't get it. it's basically $40 wasted."
1,The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
1,"I bought this monitor back in August 06. This is a very good LCD panel as a computer monitor or (HD)TV. All of a sudden, within 2 months, the monitor turns itself off automatically. The symptoms continued for a week and a few weeks later, it completely dies.I called Samsung Customer Service (1-800-SAMSUNG) and they agreed to send a replacement. RMA arrived in a week, I hooked it up and ... viola .. there is a yellow vertical line in the middle of the screen. I called Customer Service again, and they agreed to send me 2nd RMA.I'm crossing my fingers that I do not have to do RMA again.This is a really good monitor when it is working, customer service is very good too ... but .. very disappointing experience so far.My first monitor is manufactured in July 06 in Mexico.My second monitor is manufactured in September 06 in Mexico.I wonder if there are serious QA issues in Mexico."
2,"Since this product came with the product above, obviously it arrived on time and was just what I had ordered."
1,"This record is so predictable like many others of its genre. I don't know why I bother listening to music anymore. I wouldn't have written a review, but this record is worse than most. Crappy sounding as well."
1,"These didn't work for my daughter at all. Too short, Leaked every time she urinated. I love Pampers Swaddlers, but the baby dry are awful and not worth the wasted money."
1,"i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
2,"I stumbled on this album by hopping from list to list on Amazon. It caught my eye and I read the reviews on it and purchased it without even so much as hearing a track performed by Bonnie Prince Billy or any of his various other incarnations. Admittedly, the first song, ""A Minor Place"" is kind of a dud in my opinion. It generally annoys me but a few times as of late, it has seemed a better song. The rest of the album, however, is all beautiful, haunting tracks featuring Oldham's amazing song-writing and his simple voice that seems as old as time itself.Some of the particularly strong tracks on this album include Nomadic Revery, I See A Darkness, Today I Was An Evil One, and Black. And for the record, track 4 is called ""Another Day Full of Dread"", not Bread.Quite simply, this is an album with a beauty and haunting quality that cannot be described with words. It is also some of the best music to listen to while drinking with a close friend."
1,"The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars."
2,This young man is the greatest voice to come along since Sinatra. For a first album . . . or for a fiftieth . . . this one has it all! Best of all the Idols and a great talent . . . he should become a mega-star!
1,"DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. On install the etrust antivirus software (nothing else just antivirus) broke my Zone Alarm firewall, interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up. I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install; they keep popping up with guess what error message? That's right, please uninstall Etrust antivirus software, it is incompatible with our software. I've emailed Etrust and tried thier 'live' online chat and get no response. The software is evil, it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it. I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand. Don't repeat my mistake!!!"
2,"Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"
2,"The matches rock, no doubt about it. I have seen them live and they are my favorite local band ever. I saw them a little more than a year ago for the first time and I called a few friends and told them that this band weas going to be huge someday. At the time I copmpared them to sum 41 and said they were even better than them and to look out for them. Well check it out, here they are on epitaph and i am so proud of them. Only problem is, superman is not on this cd and it is one of my favorites and the fave of many others. that is too bad. all in all, be sure to grab this cd. you will really like it."
1,"I was trying to save money by going with these instead of some of the natural diapers (a few cents more per diaper) but I quickly regretted it. I've never had leaks with the natural diapers but these leaked every night. Little gooey balls came out of the diapers and stuck to my daughter's skin whenever they got wet, which I didn't like either. I was so relieved when the natural diapers I ordered to replace these arrived, and I will never use these again!!"
2,"If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time."
1,"First off, let me say that I have been braiding hair for two decades and although I am not a licensed professional, I think I would definitely qualify as an experienced braid technician, or whatever you wish to call it. I bought this product because I thought, ""Wow! This is pretty cool! It might spare the tips of my fingers from being burned"". Well, I was wrong. It doesn't ""cut"" the braid as described. It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to ""cut"" it. I ended up using my lighter. Whoever designed this should get back to the drawing board. Do not buy this product unless you want the end of your braids to look like a big flat piece of melted plastic. To give this item one star is giving it way too much credit."
2,"This is timeless and inspiring. i buy it for many people who think Kerouac is just ""On the Road"" ."
1,"This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
2,I play this cd over and over again. I use this when I'm going for long walks and te time just fly!
1,"These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device."
1,"I'm a first time mom of a baby boy. I've tried many different kinds of diapers on my son. Pamper's Baby Dry are the worst I've used. They don't hold much at all! I've been lucky and my little man sleeps through the night, but these diapers can't stand up to that (even when he was only 2 months old)! Every night they leaked. I couldn't stand it. I had to buy a different kind of diaper to use at night time until that package of baby dry was gone. My favorite diapers have to be either Pamper's Swaddlers, or Huggies Supreme Natural Fit. The only thing is, the Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller than the Pampers."
1,"What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
1,"I've had this product for less than a month - within a few uses, its finish started to wear off and now the wood is molding (see customer photo) ... it's a complete piece of junk. In addition to the poor quality of materials, as others have stated - it's not designed very well - handle is too short and not angled enough. Its only semi-redeemable quality was having very stiff, scratchy bristles that, for what areas of my back I could reach with it, those areas felt sufficiently scrubbed. But who wants to scrub their backs with a moldy back scrubber, no matter how stiff its bristles are? Yuck!I will return this as ""defective"" as it certainly fits that criteria in my mind - anything that can't even hold up through the 30-day return period is pretty pathetic."
1,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store."
2,"A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it."
1,"I was disappointed in this case. It is, to me, a thin, cheap case. I would not have bought it if I had seen and felt it before."
1,"If this movie had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. ""I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine! Go to hell!"""
1,I saw that Pampers had a good deal on subscribe and buy so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately it did not work out for us. We had a lot of leaky diapers. We have tried out Huggies and Kirkland brand diapers and are happy with those. My first preference would be Huggies and then Kirkland
2,I saw this movie 3 times. It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get. The acting and directing is top notch. Also the story is great. Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years.
2,"they taste very good.and product was in good condition, but way to much packing penuts, i would prefer somthing biodegradabl or recyclabl"
1,"This thing is a fire hazard. I bought two of them and the bottom is equal to, if not hotter than the top plate on each. I would not recommend this product as it will ruin furniture at best, and light your home/office of fire at worst."
1,"I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here."
1,"This mug warmer does NOT keep coffee at the temperature it was when I put the ceramic cup on the warmer. It keeps it warm, yes, but not hot. I still have to reheat it if i leave it for any length of time.It might be fine if you're drinking warm milk, but if you like hot coffee, I think you'll be disappointed -- as I am.The lack of auto shut-off is a problem, but I knew that when I bought it, so I just have to be vigilant about turning it off when I leave my desk."
2,"this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."
1,"Amazon says the delivery is within 24 hours for diapers when you look at the item.After placing the order, it always gives the shipping date atleast 2 to 3 weeks after palcing order. You child may go the next size by the time you receive the box.Please order the next size if you ever order diapers from Amazon."
2,Paul Bowles was a great writer who also did us the service of translating many Morroccan writings. One of these writers is Mohammed Mrabet. This little title Mhashish was put out by the City Lights label many years ago. It contains tales largely revolving around the use of kif (or hashish as Americans would call it) It is a delightful collection of tales. Mrabet is a talented writer. He draws up some tantalizing tales that delve into the positive and negative of this state of mind. It is a good introductory volume for the novice (admittedly I am a novice myself) of Morroccan literature. Mr Bowles did us a great favor in translating numerous works by Mrabet. Let us pray to Allah that City Lights finds it in their hearts to reissue these fine collections of exotic literature.
2,"One of my favorite of Gord's albums because he's singing his heart even more than usual.Nothing commercial going on here; no pop tunes, no overt attempts at a single. Instead, the best collection of lyrics Gord ever put on a single album. Each song evokes a particular mood; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.More than any other GL album, this one makes me feel like I know him."
1,"The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
2,"Fascinating. Learned many things I didn't know. Fast read. I didn't realize he traveled so much, along with helping protect the out laying villages. Must read for history buffs!"
2,"My friend was very happy with them. They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part. The only issue we had was the length of the arms. They were a little too long. Other than that, we were pleased. They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted."
1,"The origional creater of The Odyssey, Homer, did a wonderful job producing an action-packed story where you cared about the characters and made you eager to know what would happen next. Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others..."
2,"This classic novel about a young girl's pain and heartbreak continues to reach out to readers of all ages, after 35+ years. Greene's story of impossible love, between a Jewish girl in the American South and a Nazi prisoner-of-war, endures because of its timeless theme.Patty's touching story crosses all barriers. Although this story was intended for middle-grade readers, it is equally appealing to teens and adults. It is one of my all-time favorite historical novels, and I will never tire of re-reading it due to its powerful testimony to unconditional love.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"
2,This thing is super amazing. It offers a LOT of cooking options and the solid heating bowl inside makes it ideal for putting all sorts of things in with the rice to jazz up the rice or even get close to making a stew kind of thing. Highly recommended.
2,"I don't know what made reviewer Jesse think the reviews of this product were written by people paid by the company to give positive reviews. I am a real person, have used this product for over a year and like it very much. I am at an age where I look for ""Age Perfect"" products, or more often ""Age Fighting"". This eye cream is light, not greasy and makes the area around my eyes feel moisturized more than just using a day moisturizer alone. It seems to me my crows feet are less noticiable also. I am blonde and have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with any type of skin reaction. What Jesse needs to realize is that anyone could have a reaction to an ingredient in any product that they are allergic to, that doesn't mean it isn't a good product for someone else without the allergy. I have used LOREAL products for years and have always liked them. Click my name on this review to see all the other reviews I have written, and NO, they aren't all good!"
2,"For my baby shower we did a diaper raffle, so I received every diaper brand out there. These are by far the best out there. My little boy is 5 months old and is in size 3. Never any leakage problems even through the night. All my friends swear by them too!!!"
2,"My TiVo wireless adapter came when it was supposed to. Installed quick and easily, and in 5 minutes everything was up and running wonderfully. I love my TiVo. :)"
2,"In my opinion, the conflicts are well formed and the story line is basically flowing. However, there are too many political arguments that make the story boring. This book is also rather predictable, as the reader can guess what will happen next. I think that a strengthening of the plot in certain areas would make the book more enjoyable. While some parts are breathtaking, other parts are sappy and uninteresting. I'd reccomend this type of book to those who don't mind a political conflict now and then, who like romance and history, and who want to have a look back in time at what life was like back then. I sort of liked the novel, and then sort of didn't, for all of the reasons mentioned here."
1,"After one month, the paper will not lift from the tray. HP knows about this problem when I called service. They showed me how to clean the paper puller wheel. It works for now. A little dust, and the wheel gets no traction. Stay away from this printer."
1,"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!"
2,This is our 2nd one of these. The first one lasted about 2 yrs and my wife was very sad about its passing. But the 2nd is just as satisfying for her as the 1st. Wonderful item : )
2,I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.
2,This book is very informative if your child has a brain or spinal cord tumor. It is broken into easy to read sections. The quotes from people who already lived through this were priceless. I helps put things in perspective for you. It gives you tips on how to deal with unusual circumstances. It has lots of resources for contacting other organizations on the web as well. Very helpful for me and my family.
1,This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.
1,"Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it."
2,"I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
2,"What a delightful work of art. I was enchanted with the film and the music definitely caught my attention. I'm always looking for a little ""off beat"" music, i.e., Chocolat was my last favorite CD, but now this has moved up to first place. I highly recommend it for ecclectic music lovers who like that ""off beat, out of the way, different"" sound."
2,Written by a Detective who has years of study research on Stalkers. Informative important info which is important to me when needing information on sobjectts of concern. Gail H.
1,"I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
1,Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time.
1,"Bought this book on Kindle. It turns out to be impossible to navigate and is difficult to use as a guidebook. Maps are wortless on Kindle, but I knew this prior to buying it.In addition to the Kindle shortcomings I find the guide suprisingly boring.I dont care if a taxi company is run exclusivly by women and I do not understand what a ""chi- chi"" atraction is. Sadly it is impossible to return this Kindle book.Bought Bradt and Rough Guide in paper format as replacements. Will not use this one.Found this Kindle book to be worthless and as a result it got a bad rating."
2,"Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother."
1,It just like a series of unreadable words with equations. Poorly presented with not much explanation. Waste of time.
2,"This beauty and cute book is the best for catlover!Stunning photos, easy to read colour charts, a lot of informations also regarding the cats...and wonder projects to stitch!I can't wait to stitch all this beauty pussycats!"
1,"This product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."
1,"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."
1,totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
2,"This is a very cool dvd. I had forgotten how great alot of the songs are on this dvd. The song selection is great - alot of great, classic songs. The performance is great! You don't get the sense that this is a bunch of old dudes trying to recapture something that isn't there anymore - very solid, respectable performance. Great vocals, great musicianship. Very good retrospective!!! Sidenote: I had never seen a performance by Uli Roth - that is also cool. Great dvd. I am blasting it right now brother!!!"
2,"Initiation:This is a movie with some seriously gritty action. It begins with Bruce Wayne as a child and his first up close encounter with bats. A fear for this creature then grips him. After his parents are brutally killed for almost no reason, the transition cycle reaches a next level.The Missing Link:This movie provides the missing link, the element that transforms a scared young boy into a fearless force for justice. This link is located in Asia where he is mentored by Ninja Cult leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). He develops his fighting skills, however, he fails to fully develop the ability to kill.Launching the Batman:Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) finds that upon his return to Gotham City, that it has been overrun by criminals. It is at this point he activates his alter-ego: Batman.Conclusion:Excellent movie, lots of action. Intense and impactful conclusion. Highly recommended."
2,The copy of the poster was a little larger than expected but I was able to make it work with my Japanese inspired room decor. I wish it came in a smaller size 11x20 or 8x10. I would order if it came in smaller prints.
1,"I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in."
1,It is on a very rare occasion that I fail to finish a book.I feel compelled to say that this was one of them. After 100 pages I decided I could take no more. This book started me off on the wrong foot. The introduction produced a large number of characters all at once which were impossible to assimilate. The author failed to capture an audience with such boring characters and much of the narration was in rambling form.
1,"The advice itself is outdated and not useful, however the general principal will never be obsolete. Save what you can, work hard and don't live outside your means. I'll try the Modern American Frugal Housewife instead."
2,"I absolutely love the kit, it should have come with some more micro fiber cloths and the wax did spill when i received the box but besides that it works well. For painted rims i would definitely tell you not to use the tyre and rim cleaner as it's pretty strong."
2,"Squirt has been an inspiration. They're young and talented, the best thing about them is they're on fire for God by such a young age. Go shien for Him!"
1,"I found the book interesting. However, tapping on the screen continually so that I could read the print and then tapping again to see the illustrations was very annoying. Also there is a page in the middle where the sentence doesn't end but the next page begins a whole new sentence."
2,"The story line was fast paced and captivating. Steamy and erotic! The characters were strong and well developed. Ms. Foster made me care about what happened to them. By the time I got to the second half of the book, I couldn't put it down. I was up reading until 3:00 am, with a flashlight, so as not to disturb my sleeping husband. Hard to believe that this was Ms. Foster's first novel - I'll be waiting impatiently for the next......"
2,"Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of ""The House of the Seven Gables."" Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed ""The Scarlet Letter,"" complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)"
1,"Purchased this bike rack after visiting the Saris website and searching for a bike rack that could be used with a VW Beetle and Toyota 4Runner. The rack arrived in a timely manner but.........instructions were vague and hard to follow. My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to install the rack & 2 bicycles onto the 4Runner. We could get the rack on - tight & secure - but the weight of the bicycles caused the upper legs to pull away from the rear window. We finally gave up and returned the rack to Amazon. In addition, no way could the rack be used on the VW - straps and metal clips would have to be attached to glass which the instructions clearly said should not happen. I consider my husband & I to be reasonably intelligent but possible that there was something we failed to do????????A positive....Amazon paid for return shipping and credited my credit card - no questions asked."
2,"The movie has 8.5 calification, the special effect are very good, in this new time of best movies, this movie its the first movie about the First World War; the DVD has 8.7 calification, god presentation, the postal pictures from the movies are good, the extras from the movie are good.My final calification is 8.7, is a very good movie, the scense and the flow of the story is good.Please buy this title"
1,"I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."
2,"I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs. A perfect application for parties, driving and getting things done.I'll wear this disc into a coaster in no time."
1,"Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The acting, the plot, everything... completely just... BAD. Why do people enjoy this movie?"
2,"This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie. If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!"
1,"I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay."
1,The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality. It does not worth $6 at all. Its transparent also. Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt.
2,"This is a great CD. Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD. Songs like ""Temptation Waits"", ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"", ""Sleep Together"" and others really show off the quality of this group in a way you would otherwise not know. If you like what you've already heard from Garbage, you really need this CD, you will not be disappointed."
1,"Ok, I must say I am a huge fan of Nirvana and Kurt's work, but this film......it was interesting if you're willing to sit and watch nothing. This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt."
2,"I upgraded to the 128 MB Smart Media card by Simpletech and was very happy with the added storage ability for photos. It's well worth it. It's rugged, fast and works with other devices. More bang for the buck. Get it!"
1,"I have been using this printer for over a year. This is a very loud and inefficient printer. It can't even print doc well. I use top quality paper and this does not help. It is a particularly voracious ink eater as well. Stay away from it, even if they give it to you .. It is huge."
2,"We bought this for our 17 month old son. I put a Little Tikes Snug N Secure Swing in place of one of the regular swings. Every night my son runs straight for his swing. He is still too smaill for the climber, but I think he will enjoy this for many years to come.Assembly was a breeze, it took my husband about 20 minutes. the toughest part was figuring out the rope ladder.I highly recommend this toy!"
2,"FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since. Still, it has left a lasting , unavoidable impression upon me. I have both dreaded and longed to see it again. Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible."
1,A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.
1,"I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
2,"I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever."
1,"Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"
2,"I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature."
2,I enjoy these diapers as they are not bulky and do not have the new DRYMAX product. I feel like they are safe for my baby's skin.
2,"This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the story line is prety good. It has the weapon triangle like the rest of them, but the magic triangle changed which stinks. But, still in this one, you can give your units extra experience, you get to forge your own weapons, and you can change the color which is cool. The graphics are a bit better. But, still the same types of batte maps. Overall, this game is awesome!!!"
1,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
2,"First of all, is this movie for kids? Maybe. Most scenes are. However it would be good if parents would see this movie beforehand, because some of the action scenes are intense.I loved this movie from start to end. I'm 23 years old, and I have read the Narnia books, and I thought this adaptation blew the book out of the water! EXCELLENT! The director really knew what he was doing on this movie. I loved the first movie, but this one is much much better.There is a lot of action scenes that are done very well, and are very breath taking whenever you see the different creatures in Narnia in battle.There is plenty of comedy, action, adventure, and also a love story. It has a little bit of everything. I don't think they are going to beat this movie with the other ones however. I think this is Narnia at its best."
1,The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
2,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
1,"These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
2,Very Slick Looking Book - Perfect Condition and Glossy Looking - Looking forward to reading it :)
2,"This is a wonderful resource that helps me get through every day at work. My headaches and neckaches are better since I started using the yoga stretches and breathing techniques. It has taught me how to powernap to revive me from feeling exhausted, and has given me lots of tips on how to cope with change, handle stress, and enjoy life more. A lot of helpful information is packed into the useful book. Thank you very much."
1,"Well, I bought this album based upon the three songs I heard on the radio: Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials, and frankly I am dissapointed. This album is a hit and miss. On one hand it has some great songs on it, but on the other a few songs (namely Jet Pilot and X) bring it down. The only non-radio song on here that I have learned to like is Science and maybe Bounce (mainly for its comic value.)The band does have some talent, and they do have a unique sound to them. However, I think that if they trimmed off some of the lower quality songs on here, the album would have been better."
2,While many families don't get along for one reason or another... Sometimes it takes a miracle to make people look at their own lives a bit closer... in this film.. mainly a comedy with some twist... you might relate to dealing with a whole family coming together for a mothers funeral.You may check out the trailer here as long as Youtube has it available[...]
1,"my God! this actually gets zero stars!!! how can anyone listen to this schlock?!?! clay aiken sounds exactly like the backstreet crossed with whitney houston. a CD full of sorry sounding pop hooks and soppy balladry is just absolutely aweful! if you want some good pop hooks and ballads, then get simon and garfunkle instead. and if you feel like some soppy balladry then get david bowie's ""hunky dory""...just make sure you pass on this true piece of crap of an album...seriously, this sucks really really bad"
1,"Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally. The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class. The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower. His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act. To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title."
1,"I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple."
1,"Till now I've never seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie, this would be the first. We kept hoping it would end and will never watch it again."
1,"I was really disappointed with this book, especially since it was so highly recommended by friends and in general. I guess perhaps when it was written the ideas Fromm expressed were new, or at least the way he expressed them were new, but I can't believe that any minimally self-aware person hasn't thought about at least 80 to 90 percent of these ideas themselves. Fromm seems to be the typical over-educated, intellectual psychologist/philosopher, who takes a simple idea (if you don't know and love and understand yourself and the world around you, you can't love another person) and over-analyzes it, giving historical and biblical examples. Just another 90-odd pages of psychobabble."
2,"Braden draws a connective thread in this work uniting the sacred taught wisdoms of the past, the science of modern times, and the lives we seek to live today into a congruent whole. The effect of his passion for answers, moments of puzzlement, and intense desire to help create an everlasting peace, illuminates pathways that can lift people from lives of confusion to lives of direction. Many of the concepts noted had before been free-standing models that Braden draws into a much bigger, stronger picture."
2,"This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. There may be a new edition that supercedes this one by the time you read this. if so, I would buy it without reservation. I find myself reaching for this time and again when I write. Highly recommended."
1,"Others have mentioned the heroine is a brat, and she truly is. I'm half-way through and dislike her immensely. Shouldn't I like her by page 156, and be rooting for her and the gorgeous hero? I feel bad that Quin is going to end up with this awful woman. This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many better ones! The plot sounded fun to me and Quin isn't an alpha male, but still likeable enough. Its Maddie. She slaps him. She makes fun of him. She has atrocious manners. She's insufferable!"
1,"Each soup alone has over 20g of carbs! And that's just for soup not a meal! To lose weight (not just maintain your current weight) you can only eat 20-30grams of carbs per day, not per meal.Most of these veggie cookbooks are for the rich anyway, a lot of the ingredients are only available at fancy-pants stores like whole foods. I hate to say it but diets like Atkins are within reach for low-income folks. Who has time (or money) to find something called 'mirin' whatever that is"
1,"I'm not a huge dance/techno/electronica/call-it-what-you-want fan, but I do dabble. And seeing the addition of vocals, bass and guitars to a dance outfit piqued my interest. Unfortunately, it didn't hold it. Nothing really bad here, it just didn't make much impression. ""Drop the Break"" is OK, and I liked the trance-y feel of ""Yallah Habibe"". The only other impression I got was the rather silly lyrics on ""Abduction"". Serviceable for background music, but not really an album I could get into."
2,"As a Veteran, I am apalled and sickened by the contents of this book. If even a small percentage of the allegations outlined in this book are true; this has to be America's greatest shame. Abandoning those who fought and served in harm's way for their country is inexcusable.The first half of the book seems to be all about explaining the abandoning of our POWs, which has taken place since WWI, and establishing the credentials of the Communist official who provided most of the ""facts."" It requires a lot of concentration to wade through all the facts and dates. The second half deals with the ""nuts and bolts"" of the abandonments and methods of attempts to cover it all up. The government agencies involved includes almost every DOD and Security agency in our frderal government along with most members of congress and the executive branch. Fascinating but disgusting.Man up and bring our Heroes home."
2,"More as a point of clarification than review: the Oxford World's Classics edition is not the 1855 edition. (All the comments & editorial reviews for various versions of Leaves of Grass seem to have all be funneled into the same place.)According to the ""Note on the Text"" in the Oxford edition, it is the ""death-bed"" edition published in 1891-92. It is based on the 1881 edition.If you want the original 1855 version, Penguin offers it. Search: ""Leaves of Grass Penguin classics"".In any case: the 5 stars are for Whitman."
2,"Also a must-have for Perry Mason fans... good acting, exciting plot lines and a nice glimpse into 1960s legal practice in L.A!"
1,"The acting was bad, especially those of the supporting characters. The actors weren't helped by some awful dialog. The plot was rediculous, though some of that was intentional. The low-budget special effects were silly, and not in a good way. In short, don't waste your money on this stinker."
1,"Yesterday, HP pulled the Mac OS X driver for the 1022 from its website, most likely because of Mac users buying 1020s and installing the driver to workaround it. I have not spoken to any HP people to confirm this, but I did download the driver on Tuesday, and after deleting it, found out I needed it again. Only today the driver is gone and the date the page was updated was May 18th! Nice job, HP!"
2,"Great language, humor and wonderful story telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell's books. Always enjoy reading them. I got thisfor my son on his 11th birthday. I think it will also help himgreatly improve his vocabulary."
2,"I notified Digi Acc to let them know that I ordered the wrong battery. I have 2 Canon digitals and they use different batteries. I ordered the Canon NB-5L for the Canon SD950 IS and should have ordered the Canon NB-4L for the Canon ELPH100HS.I called Digi Acc and left them a message and never received a response. If someone would respond, I would like to exchange the battery."
1,"How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
1,"The pump already looked fishy, it had some remains of contact glue at the top end of the pump. 15 minutes ( 65 cm on the way ) the top part comes off..I guess with contact glue I will be able to fix the pump, still...The ball itself so far holds well, not sure if one is supposed to sit on it when its not fully inflated though..T."
1,this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed
1,The product was very difficult to put on that I just gave up on it. Couldn't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away.
2,"Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan."
2,"GREAT STORY... LOVE IT, WHAT A GREAT MAN HE WAS!!! THIS IS A NICE MOVIE OF ONE OF OUR SAINTS!!!!"
2,"While I do admit that these stories are no longer capable of scaring me, I also understand the fact that...this is a children's book. That being said, if you are not 12 and under, you might find some of the stories rather bland-- especially if you're a serious horror fan.Anyway, this book is great for campfire/sleepover/Halloween party-type settings. They're pretty short, but still quite enjoyable. My father read these books to my siblings and I as children during the month of October, and they scared the crap out of us.The illustrations....weird, scary, freaky stuff. Bottom line. In my opinion, the pictures are even scarier than the actual stories. I'm 26 now, and some of them still creep me out to this very day. So, if you're intending to read these stories aloud, then make sure that you show the pictures to add to the scare factor.Overall, I still enjoy this collection of stories. I highly suggest giving them a shot."
2,"We tried 4 or 5 different kinds of diapers when our son was born from all the samples and such. We got a pack of these from a neighbor and they worked the best of all, so we've stuck with these. You can tell how wet the diaper is by feeling how inflated the diaper is. Wish I was using cloth diapers but that didn't really work out for us due to logistics (no washer) and I wish I had a more ""natural"" choice, but others are more expensive and don't work as well. These are 14.5 cents a diaper w/ Amazon Mom."
2,A fascinating look at a young man who is beginning to question his youthful ideals. Does he abandon his lower class family and everything he believes to marry into a wealthy family? It is beautifully written and very real.
1,"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."
1,"This product does not work well. The needle frequently gets stuck, and therefore doesn't tell the temperature. I have already thrown away the packaging, so I won't be able to return it, but I will throw it away and look for something more reliable. Don't waste your money."
1,"This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."
1,"John Steinbeck who is the author of this book ""Of Mice And Man"",wrote about the forgotten people like the lonely migrant workers.Lennie and George are two migrant worker with different personalities. Lennie is a huge man with an ironic mind, he all the time gets in trouble accidently,George is a small man,but has a quick mind. These two left Weed to Soledad where they attemped to realize their dreams which is to get their own land and have a good life, not to spend their money at a cat house. Since they are not lonely like the other migrant workers. Lennie and George have each others.This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommand this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend."
2,"Completely captivating and amazing. When I saw the movie I knew nothing about it and I am glad otherwise the plot would have been ruined. So, I won't say anything about the plot.This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.The DVD has very few Special Features. But, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are preceded by an interview with the director explaining why each of them was cut out of the film."
1,"As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order."
1,"20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it."
1,"Oh my god! This movie was so pathetic. I rented it hoping it would be good like I had heard. But no! What I saw was the most stupid and boring movie! The acting was good and so was the story, but the movie sucked, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!"
1,Saw them live with Dredg and they stunk up the joint...badly.Don't compare them to TMV...no comparsion in any manner.
1,"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! The transfer quality of this DVD ""SECRET AGENT"" is discusting. This is the 21st century, the digital age. With the latest transfer machines on the market there are no excuses for studio's churning out rotten transfers. Before you buy this disc, ask yourself if you can sit through an unwatchable image. Good old ""Hitch"" would turn in his grave if he knew what was happening to his precious movies. A warning should be posted about the rotten transfer of this disc and I have just done it! DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!"
2,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is an amazing book that combines the life of a worker and social pressure. It takes place on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. The two main characters, George and Lennie, are out to create a life for themselves. They are almost like brothers. This story has many twists and turns and makes you think about your best friend. The story creates a suprising ending. It is a great short story for someone looking for a short and good read. I recommend this to everyone. The only thing about this book making it un-acceptable would be the colorful language that John Steinback uses, but otherwise, the entire story is amazing and will never be forgotten."
1,"I won't use it again.very low quality. I feel the frequency with which I change these ,adds up the cost.so better to buy a good quality diaper."
1,Check their web site at www.emarker.com. A pity. This looked like a good idea. :-(
1,"I just received the DVD today, and watching it was very disappointing. It's only 1.9GB on disc. There are double images throughout most of the movie. It's a 4:3 frame size rather than at its 1.85:1 original size. Don't buy this Synergy DVD!"
2,"I appreciate the favorable comments made by all of the reviewers. For the record, however, in response to Peter George: my note on Stonewall Jackson accurately observes that the Confederate forces under his command repulsed the Union army at the first Bull Run and forced their retreat to Washington. I elsewhere add (chapter V, note 14) that J. E. Johnston commanded all Confederate forces in the battle. Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even ""demeaning"" to ""educated Penguin readers,"" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough. I can only reply that my notes are intended to aid precisely those undergraduates who require them, not the pedants who are perfectly entitled to ignore them."
1,"Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."
2,"The Canterbury Tales was a notably written book,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect story. It was very interesting to read this book and I reccommend it for any others who like to read short little tales as are in this book."
1,"Gerber changed the recipe for the worse, this version isn't new and improved. It's worse I think because of the addition of the tuna oil/DHA. When the weather cools down I'll hide this in soups and stews as a mystery ingredient. Even the dog won't eat it :("
2,I was looking for clarity and a picture that would completely fill my HD television screen without manipulation. I found it with this DVD and couldn't be happier.
2,"With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"
2,Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.
2,"Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Plus, she is just plain funny. The video is divided into six ""classes"" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting. I highly recommend the set!"
2,"He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
1,"Product information is confusing and have so bad luck i received the Bootleged version. Still i'm keeping it because i'm not very picky with cosplay, but for hardcore cosplayers stay away, looks really cheap and fake! :("
2,"Reading the original version was great and disappointing. Don't get me wrong Wells has always been one of my favorites. But Hollywood has changed the story, quite a bit.It was a pleasure to read it as it was written."
2,this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1,"This movie typifies the lazy, expensive, misguided Hollywood misfires of the last 20 years, with its bargain-Blade-Runner-with-more-neon sets, poorly realized characters and jarring tonal shifts. Is it for kids? Is it for adults? A comedy? Thriller? Sci-fi? Who knows! Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichd, cartoonish ""action"" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating. Only watch this out of sheer curiosity."
2,"I love this movie! It was very funny, yet sweet and touching. Altough the ending was a bit shocking to me,I'll be first in line to buy it when it comes out. Adam and Drew work great together. Hawaii is beautiful, the soundtrack rocks, and this movie is awesom! GO SEE IT!! GO NOW!!"
2,"The Sassy Baby warming dishes are great! Add the hot water let it sit while you get baby ready to eat and away you go. Also keeps the food warm while baby is eating. The bright colors also hold the babys attention. We bought two one for home and one for grandmas house.Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary"
2,"You defintely can judge the book by its cover on this book. I really liked it a lot. I used this book as a reference tool to teach my philosophy/ethics class in college. This is defintely not for the serious philosophy student, but a very nice introduction to the ideas that dominated western thought throughout the Greek/Roman world that has come to us today. It also treats postmodernism, and the ideas that dominates today as well. This book presents a very lucid history of ideas that is very enjoyable and fun to read!Because I had to interloan the book from another library and I am unable to renew it, I will buy it after I place this review. ..."
1,"Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"
2,"If you want to introduce the fantasy genre to a younger reader, I can't imagine a better starting place than this book. A lot of story is packed into this beginning chapter book. Although some profound issues are raised, I think what will appeal to most young readers is the adventure and the relationship between the boy and the new pet he brings home - which, in this case, happens to be a dragon! Readers will no doubt want to read the rest of the books in this series which, though not as good, are certainly entertaining."
1,"I don't know why one reviewer was so easy on Harrington. This book is just filled with errors. The web site isn't even available anymore. I am weary of these academics writing shoddy books,rife with errors,and then not even posting errata. STAY AWAY from this work."
2,"This movie makes a person consider the subject of Alien contact. I thought some of the alien depictions needed to be more realistic, but it showed real human emotion in the various situations that were presented in the story and the actors did preform their parts well."
2,"This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians."
2,"Civil War veteran John Carter is carried away to Mars. There, he impresses the giant green Tharks with his hand-to-hand combat skills, falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, and has many adventures. Very fun escapist yarn. Totally implausible, but never really asks you to take it seriously. Pure wish-fulfillment heroic fantasy. Burroughs' prose is a bit archaic and stilted, and some plot twists were too extraordinary to be satisfying. Overall, however, Princess is very entertaining pulp fiction."
2,"Wow, Clay's new Cd is even better than I thought it would be!He is my favorite new artist and his amazing voice touches my soul. Every song on this CD is good. Great job, Clay!"
2,"I didn't like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good."
2,"Excellent show. Adult Swim is being cheap with dvd packaging. ATHF, Venture Bros. Season 4.1, and Squidbillies vol. 3.1 ALL have SERIOUS lack of quality and artwork. I expect this is across the board. It's sad, I do not know what is happening here but my days of buying Adult Swim DVD seasons is over."
1,"Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy."
1,"My coffee cup just barely fit on the plate. I thought I would try a different manufacturer of mug warmers. I already had one that worked. Both products worked the same. I realize that the voltage has a limit on it, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot enough unless you can drink your cup of coffee in 30 minutes. I sip on mine for 2 hours and get very tired of continually having to zap the coffee in the microwave just to heat it up while still using the coffee warmer.Can the manufacturer's come up with a better idea that actually works?"
1,"I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. Everything on it worked great. A couple of months later the handle to tighten the miter adjustment stripped out. I ordered replacement parts from Makita and received them in a very timely fasion. Shortly after that it stripped again so I made my own replacement parts that work much better. Unfortunately other cheap plastic parts on it are starting to fail and fall apart. I am a big believer in Makita tools and own many for my contracting business, but I strongly suggest buying a different saw. The best part on the saw is the folding stand which I now use to hold my old De Walt rack and pinion table saw."
2,"I picked up Of Mice and Men because it was short and I figured that I could read a good book in a small amount of time. The book turned out to be as expected if not better. I think that it is possible to get as much if not more sometimes out of a short book like this one. The book kept me involved in the plot all the way till the end. The ending made the book very good, but you will have to read it for yourself to get that satisfaction!"
2,"While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them."
1,GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.
1,This book is not worth the poor trees that died or it.The Chandlers are con-artists and bullies. Save your money and seek the truth.
1,I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
1,"I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price, but expected something that worked. EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper. I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results. If you do decide to buy, 1) ensure the store will accept returns, and 2) be prepared to pay return shipping."
1,"I would like to blame the director, but, didn't she preview her own material?Whatever it is that would account for the awful audio -- the sound mixing, or Ms. Corn's strident, almost lecturing tone as she reads her voice-over script -- I found it remarkably annoying and distracting. Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak. I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration. A big disappointment."
2,"Heavy these guys are excellent at writing lyrics and since rage against the machine isn't around anymore these guys are using they're anti govermant message. Anyway back to the album toxicity is great every song is perfect though you you will skip songs like jet piolit to get to songs like chop suey.My favorite songs are prison song,needles,chop suey,bounce,atwa,toxicity,psycho,and aerials."
2,"I love this cd! I never get tired of the songs,especially ""Never"". It's got both fast as well as slow rock which can get you on your feet or put you in another world. No matter what, this will always be my favourite album."
2,"I bought this game at Best Buy and am glad I did! This game has good levels which are FUN games! I do think they need to add a couple more! Although it may look as though there is only multiplayer, there is a single game. One game which you squirt other players is REALLY hard to control! I don't think you are supposed to control the people! The level is really fun though. When you choose a player(s) the game chooses the other people you are playing against. The sound is really hard to hear but not bad if you turn up the volume. The graphics are okay. All and all I think this is a pretty good game!"
1,The author of this book hates freedom and his book is unsupported by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
1,"I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star."
2,"I bought the TiVo wireless G network adapter two years ago for my Series 2 TiVo. Since then I have retired my Series 2 and began using this adapter with my TiVo HD. It is an attractive adapter and has worked flawless for me. I just purchased a new TiVo Premiere and was going to buy another wireless G network adapter for it. Then I came across a TiVo press release announcing a new TiVo wireless N network adapter coming in May 2010. So I will be holding off on my wireless adapter purchase until then. I don't know if the Series 3 TiVo will be able to take advantage of the increased wireless speeds or not, but I have read that the TiVo Premiere will. I do plan on keeping my current wireless G adapter for my TiVo HD."
2,"This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf."
2,"This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life."
1,"This product did not work for me. Even though the active ingredients are the same as name brands, the formulation seems to be different. For the price, you might want to try a bottle to see if it will work for you."
2,this is being re issued as a 4 movie set mgm has released the double feature discs in a new package that has these movies bundled with another double feature set in one case. still midnight movies but a 4 movie set all the double features are being combined better deal.
2,Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
2,"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."
2,"In this historical fiction book the story is told of how the colonists were able to keep the war going in the face of the British blockade of Boston harbor. The year was 1775, the Revolutionary War was in its early stages, and the colonists were out of ammunition enough to not overthrow the British out of their city. With Boston Harbor blockaded, the colonists could not gain any ammunition, so colonist Henry Knox hears of Fort Ticonderoga stocked with ammunition and devises a plan with his brother Will to bring the guns back to General Washington in the middle of winter. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a historical war book."
1,"I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print."
1,"Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
2,"Interesting film set in Vietnam brings up the whole issue of morality in war. Can morality exist in war? Is there such an animal? In such a graphic film depicting death, carnage and rape where does one draw the line? Penn is excellent as usual but Fox probably cast for his mere presence, as a character of virtue may be the real casualty here that diminishes the impact of the director's intentions. This film contains one of Ennio Morricone's best latter scores."
2,I love this product. This is my 2nd one because the gears stripped on the first one. I like it so much I hunted around until I found one I could afford. I'm hoping this one will last longer.
1,"90% of it was not in the book. Strong misunderstanding of the book or it's themes.Basically this was a scifi channel movie (ie terrible) with better actors and special effects.Whoever was responsible for this movie should be tied to a pole and whipped, then allowed to go back and play dungeons and dragons by himself in the basement.They could have found someone who could resonate with the book and bring it forward in a new light. Instead they found someone who felt a need to make it a nonstop meaningless sequence of stupid fight scenes.If the movie is only 10% based on the book, don't use it's name. Try and sell your sad movie on it's own merits."
2,I love Clay just the way he is or should I say was because some producers or who ever went into the studio and took a special part of Clay away in this CD. It is a good CD and I will enjoy it but it could have been great if they had not messed with the essence of Clay. To the producers or remixers or who ever the quilty party is CLAY'S VOICE IS GREAT IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT!!!!!
2,"Maeve Binchy is a great storyteller. All of her books are filled with character description and are definately page turners. The Silver Wedding took me by suprise the way each character had different views on the same events which is usually true in real life. This is the seventh book of Binchy's that I have read and everytime I finish one, I can't wait to start the next. The Silver Wedding, although not my favorite of hers, lived up to my expectations of Bincy's marvelous ability to telling a story. Definately recommende d as a summer read. (or anytime!)"
1,I didnt like this movie all too much... I thought it would be great but whats so scarey about it? I guess in my young age I dont understand what its like to have satans child but I still thought it was dumb and not scary at all. I have watch alot of horror movies... ALOT! And this one shouldnt be one of them its not even scary... If you are looking for thrills and chills look somewhere else because this movie is purely made for people who are scared VERY easily.
1,"I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase."
1,"I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."
1,"I cannot believe the ""discounted"" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3.00 (that's right, $20 less). Search on ""key float""."
2,"Viewing ""Magic"" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to ""watch this actor."" I saw ""Magic"" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a ""squeeze box"" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role."
2,"Excellent diaper, fits well, stays on, very adjustable size. The only accidents we have had are the inevitable up-the-back, and you have to make sure the leg elasticity are fluffed out when you put them on."
1,"Just got the game....NOT IMPRESSED! These 5 star reviews must have been written by the makers of the game, cuz this player thinks it [stinks]. Lara's movements are slow and chunky. Movements that used to be simple, such as jump back to get a run forward, has turned into spin Lara around, walk, and spin around again...and since this changes your view of the surroundings it's easy to get confused (camera angles [stink] too) Lara's control is a nuisance and it's NOT worth my time to play this game."
1,"Last Days was easily the worst movie I have seen since Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."
1,"This book needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book."
1,"I will prepare myself to face the wrath of other Clay fans, but I think this CD is a disappointment.Clay's voice has been watered down on most of the tracks (about 3 of them sound something ""like"" Clay). This is probably an attempt to attract the crowd Simon thought Clay couldn't attract; but the producers/writers may have garnered Clay new fans at the expense of the old ones.I do not think he would have sold one million pre-sale copies had many of us heard the entire CD. This CD is Justin Timberlake lite (and that's no compliment).No Diane Warren or Sedaka style songs. Someone should have listened to his demo CD (or AI for heaven's sake)in order to put together a debut worthy of Clay's voice.If this continues, I will be an ex-Clay fan. Or, should I say, I will remain an AI Clay fan, forever waiting for him to come back to form.Anyway, I know many of you like the CD, but for me, what a let down."
1,"Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."
1,"While researching this product I found several risky side effect and several may or may not have bennifits. Lemon balm, Burdock, German chamomile, and Yarrow were safer in nature than the other herbs included. But an expert or professional should be following you and helping you decide if these are right for you. The other herbs have potential harm according to the research or are possibly not even effective. St. John's Worts can be very dangerous if taken with any other medication for example. Do the research first to keep yourself and your loved ones safe!!"
2,A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Scope easily focuses by tilting the scope rather than fiddling with adjustment knobs. It's so fun to see things really close up!
1,"This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
2,"Just a few words, if you have not read this book go get it now! This is one of those books written from the heart, that cannot- but have you in tears, truely written from the heart; it stired my soul! A true story of a young girl overcoming nightmares that we would not dread to imagine, it has truely opened my eyes, to the horror, that so many people lived through, and so many not....Well done Livia! A book that will live for an eternity!"
2,"I have seen all the earlier Batman movies and I must say this is by far the greatest. The older ones were ok, but lacked that realistic feel. In Batman Begins I felt moved by it, it was realistic, it was dramatic, and it felt real. This movie is a must buy for any action/adventure lover."
1,"With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich."
2,"This remixed soundtrack is great. Some DJ's techno, dance, and house is interwined into Yoko's music for a CD which will leave you dancing. I love how all of my fav. songs are remixed with so much emotion, and beat. Each song made me get up and dance with its kickin' grooves and modern day instruments. The begining portion is great, with that very uncanny remix of ""Theme of Aya"". The middle is the meat. This is when the new kicks out the old. Its amazing. And at the end, the CD is brilliantly closed with a rock/trance remix of everybody's favourite, ""Somnia Memorias""!"
2,"Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing."
1,"I bought this game and it really sucks! The reason that I bought this game was because I like Rocket Power a lot, and I thought it would be cool to have this game. Once I played it I got bored and wanted to sell it. It doesnt save at all. You have to write passwords down!If you are planning to have this game, you shouldnt! Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played."
2,I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener.
2,"Orwell tells a story about Winston Smith, a man living in the utopian world of 1984! The book deals with his struggles, and eventually, the story's end is so depressing that in the end, you may want to commit suicide or take up liquor. BEWARE"
1,"What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?"
1,"This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read."
2,"A great conclusion to a great series. If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must-watch."
2,We bought this drum set for our 4yr old son & he loves it! It was easy to assemble & it is very stable. It produces great sound & it will last for years!
1,"Just stick with the video games, whether they are old or new. This film fails on many levels: it's not as exciting or engaging as a real video game, and it's not as smart or entertaining as any other film. Not even Dennis Hopper can save it. Fans of the original Super Mario Bros. will be definitely disappointed not only because of the lack of excitement, but also the lack of any real connection between the game and the film. As a matter of fact, this doesn't even look like an actual Mario Brothers adaptation (there are many things in this movie that are not connected to the original games). It looks like a completely different fantasy film with just a few elements of the video games added in. I have never actually played Super Mario Bros. and I don't exactly hate this film. But still, the entire movie is flat, dull, and very uninteresting. If you absolutely love Nintendo, then stay away from the Super Mario Bros movie. Nothing in the film works.Grade: D"
2,"I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin' this 1982 release every day. ""My Favorite Person"" had all the classic flavor of the O'Jays. Itwas probably their last classic Philly sound release as the problems Philadelphia International would have with CBS Records wouls eventually set in and a move to EMI would be forthcoming. ""Your Body's Here With Me"" is the signature cut on this reissued double album but ""My Favorite Person"", ""I Just Want To Satisfy"", and ""One On One"" were classic cuts as well. ""When Will I See You Again"" dropped great songs with their own version of the classic Three Degrees hit. Check out ""I Can't Stand The Pain"". These two albums are probably the hardest to find of all of the O'Jays albums besides the ones released on the TSOP(The Sound Of Philadelphia) label. PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE ITS NOW ON 1 CD!"
1,"You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
2,"Bought this for my niece, as I had one similar as a child and she loves it as much as I did! It's a fun way to learn addition and subtraction!"
1,"Less western, more what makes a woman tick. Not a favorite, skipped whole paragraphs after one too many trips through this girl's two page at a thought train."
2,Fits as expected and is well made. It lacks a cord to tether it to your camera but you can easily purchase one that sticks on the front if you feel you need one. I however prefer to just keep the cap in my pocket when the camera is in use so its not flopping around and getting in the way.

1,"This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."
1,"This book does an admirable job of describing the great accomplishments of the WW2 generation. Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place. Look at the children neglected while their mothers work. Look at the skyrocketing national debt. Look at the social security debacle. The 'Greatest Generation' passed all these on to us to solve.Look around Tom... they were a major failure."
2,"I thought I was buying a compilation of original recordings that I had heard and loved while listening to them on the radio. Several of them are one-hit wonders. Imagine my surprise as, while listening, I realized that these for the most part are not original recordings, but are studio recordings by the original artists.For me it is like having the artists in my living room or car, singing their special spin on fond aural memory.A couple of the songs are hilarious spins. For example, ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" almost got me in an accident when I was driving it was so hilaripoignant. There is a song about a mule skinner on one of the CDs I never heard before. It sounds like a mule skinner on moonshine to me! lolYou will be lucky to find the recordings I was lucky enough to stumble across in this 3-disk compilation. Good luck to you in finding them!"
1,"I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage movie I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap movie and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that movie, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I am glad it was free thru the Prime, thank goodness!"
1,Lucky Luciano helping to put an end to the invasion of Sicily --- I think not. The story line was a little too hard to believe. Don't mix up gangsters with your stories of war and espionage. Stick to your Dillon and Ferguson characters. They're the ones that we like to read Mr. Higgins.
1,"Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white."
2,"I love this diapers. They can hold pretty good. And no rash ever. My baby is turning 6 months, only the first box of diapers I did not buy from Amazon. Good deal,A+"
1,"I am a big fan of Dougles Adams books, at least in general.But this book is, at best, only marginally funny. Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry. Why, I don't know, and I have no idea why some think this is humorous."
1,"This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."
1,"This is a supposed ""thriller"" that is actually a dull, dialogue ridden yawner with little action and uninteresting characters. The ""mystery"" involved is psuedo-solved in a very unsatisfiying way and the reason behind the murder involved is (to say the least) contrived. I read the descriptions on every box and bag in my cupboard before I resorted to complete the reading of this book. I held out a very small hope that its ""resolution"" might be in some way satisfying. My hopes were crushed. I will avoid this author at all cost in the future."
1,"I absolutely agree with all previous reviews: great movie, but it should be in widescreen version on DVD. Otherwise I can watch it on tv. I hope that someday I'll be able to buy the widescreen version."
1,"Let me just get this straight: I love ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". If this DVD had a good transfer, good extras, and uncensored, I would have gone for it's purchase and give it a 5.The problem is, this DVD is the opposite on what I would have gone for.The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.Are there any extras? No. Unlike what the lying eyes of the box says, no. And the film is only 14 years old. It deserves extras, at least a theatrical trailer and pencil test.I'd wait for a special edition."
1,This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.
2,"I bought one then bought 2 more. They are simple to put together and sturdy/heavy enough to hold my shoes. I didnt think that tennis shoes would fit, but they did. Everything except boots..."
2,"Finnaly the Black Crowes are back to what they are doing best-dirty,bluesy rock & roll. Probably the most Black Crowes's fans(including myself) were wondering whether they will produce an album to match the level set by their first two projects. Yes, The Black Crowes delivered it. It is a huge enjoyment to listen ""By Your Side"". WELL DONE BOYS! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE YOU ON STAGE."
2,Once we figured out that you needed to add a teaspoon of water to the gumbase before you microwave it it was a lot of fun. The instruction say to pour off excess water but neglect to tell you to add water in the first place. My son and his freids had a blast making their own custom gums. I had to help with the kneeding process but over all I think it's a great product for kids who like their gum. You can substitute splenda for the powdered sugar if you want to make sugar fee gum too.
1,"I have several go-to vegetarian cookbooks which have similar recipes. I was looking for recipes with more vegetarian protein sources, such as tempeh and seitan. There are only a couple with the former and the latter isn't even mentioned. Maybe my fault for assuming low carb equates to higher protein."
1,"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
2,Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts.
1,"Horrible movie that leaves a very bad taste in your mouth with a bad acting performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast as a hard boiled detective who fights against demons in LA. His performance is a real misfire on the part of the people who made this film and it hurts the film in a lot of ways. His co-star Rachel Weisz is ten times the actor Keanu is and she has the most interesting character in the whole movie. Her character is so good that she should have been the lead instead of poor Keanu but we don't live in a perfect world so we have to suffer with Keanu trying to act tough. The script is an absolute mess from beginning to end and the special effects are not done properly in some scenes of the film.See the film for Rachel Weisz performance alone but other than her, wait for video."
2,"This is a fantastic diaper. It can do what it says-- stand up to a 12 hours of peeing overnight. It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box."
2,"I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed."
1,"Will never know if this works well or not. Needed help with set up and Zoom customer service was non-responsive. Asked repeatedly during frustrating email exchange for access to telephone support. Was stonewalled. Finally, gave up, bought a competing product which installed flawlessly. Put Zoom product on Craigslist and took my loss."
2,"Of mice and men is a brilliant book. Steinbeck is a colourful writer and shows how some men can be compassionate to the weak (in this case weak in the mind!), others passive and worse still, others can be cruel. very powerful!"
1,"The book was one of the most funny I've read, and the film just didn't do it justice. One improvement is that Sonny's character is much sweeter and more likeable in the film than in the book, but the finer points of the story have been lost. The part about the beard, for example, which wasn't just very touching, and funny, but incredibly shocking to someone born in 1964 and had never known a time when beards were downright subversive! All the actors were excellent--but more of the book could have been written into the film.Also, to a previous reviewer, the time frame of the story is in the early '50's--they were NOT returning from the Vietnam War! The Korean War was in the early '50's; the Vietnam War didn't begin till 1964!"
1,"This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away. I dont have my old copies any more and now the old books are going for outrageous sums. I wanted to get these books for my kids someday--not any more."
1,Despicable lyrics promoting drugs and denigrating police destroy otherwise noteworthy and engaging rock music.
1,"I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
2,Excellent Book. I have been looking for ideas to celebrate the Winter Solstice as my birthday lands on this day and I enjoy having friends over for pot-luck and bonfire. This book has given me more ideas and it was good as I was hoping.
2,"Matt Monro had a great voice. It's a shame that he never reached greater status in the United States for having such a gift. There are 36 songs on this album and they are all good. His ""From Russia With Love"" vocal from the James Bond film is a classic."
1,"Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
2,"Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time. Highly recommended."
1,"We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
2,"Without a doubt one of the best books on Table Saw jigs. Many of the others I looked at had USELESS projects that went along with them....just filler. This book has NO FILLER, just great tips!! I constantly reference this book whenever doing a new type of cut, to see what time saving (and safer) way I could perform the task at hand. GET IT!!!"
2,"Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."
2,For someone who likes smooth chill out music with an equal amount of sexy R&B and smooth hook laden pop this is a must own single to add to your collection.
1,"It would have been more honest if these players had just presented this disc as their own interpretations of these fine songs. These songs do NOT sound as though the Beatles were doing them. Any creditable musicians with genuine love for the early Beatles sound and atmosphere could have done a better job recreating these numbers, if that was the desire. For a good comparison, listen to ""That Means A Lot"" done by Billy Sullivan (not half so well known as Vinny Fazzari), on his ""All American Popster"" album -- exquisite!"
1,"This book proves Mr. Pinnock, rather than dialoguing with Conservative, Evangelical Providence-Theists, is himself an extreme libertarian ultra-arminian attempting a synthesis & amalgamation with Processism in reaction to his perceived brand of hyper-calvinism (which few embrace and none of the authors who devastate free-willism like Millard Erickson).This is Quasi-Processism plain and simple.CHAFF OUTWEIGHS THE WHEATMORE STEAK SAUCE THAN MEAT"
1,"My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!"
1,"Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
2,I was looking for a shower door that could open from either the left or the right and I did not want one to choose for me. This door ticks and fits all the right boxes in that department. I like the crystal glass effect too. It is very clear and allows a lot of light into the shower hub. It is frameless too which is what was asked for by the wife.Its sturdy quarter of an inch thick glass also is a nice feature. But most of all the pivot door is a feature I got on with too.
1,"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."
2,"This concert is a little of a roller coaster ride. Bothe the audio sound quality of her voice and the musical quality oscillate between outstanding and mediocre. The high points are the electric version of ""Gloria"" at the end and a spectacular version of her own written masterpiece ""I wish we could be alone"" """"Ti Amo is also good. The opening ""Lucky One "" and ""Satisfaction"" are dissapoionting I have to make this evalution as a die hard Laura an in the 80's and 90's. I don't know why the audio quality of her voice reproduction varies from excellent to lousy from song to song but it does. This tape is also a moving story of her personality which Branigan fans will appreciate much I do"
1,"It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it."
1,"Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay."
2,I bought this for a friend. She really liked it. I like her. Everything's just fine.
2,"A book that I would recommend to anyone wondering what they aredreaming about. I had quite a few ""ahaa"" moments while reading this book. Well written and lots of example dreams to help youdecipher your own. Thank you to Sylvia."
2,"I received this scale just last week, and I am happy to report that it is everything I expected. I was sick of spending money on expensive digital (inconsistent) models, that stopped working after only a year or so of use. This unit provides consistent readings at eye level. It was simple to complete assembly of the two main pieces shipped in the box, and was simple to balance (and rebalance as necessary if the scale is moved)."
2,"It's a well recommended product. Therefore what I would like to comment is, based on my job I work late unplanned hours and it's very difficult for me to plan my shopping list. Having Amazon door to door service for this product is so convenient that it ease myself so much. You place the order and it's delivered to your door step on time."
2,"Leave it to Life Magazine to deliver both a poignantly illustrated and informative journey through the tragedy and heroics of 11 September. Unlike other publications of this disaster, Life covers all three crash sites. The photos are vivid and emotional. The information explains the minute-by-minute details while providing an illustrated perspective of the attack and aftermath. Life Magazine has been a valuable companion to other historic events, like JFK's assasination. This book is a guidepost along the somber journey through 11September and its aftermath. Treasure it."
2,REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.
2,"i read this book, and this is my second favorite book! my first is journey to the center of the earth"
2,"This book is a good read for anyone who want to know more about God, the Holy Spirit. It explains the TRUTH surronding the Holy Spirit, what he does for us, how to be filled, and the fruits of the Spirit. Very Biblical based."
1,"I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,I bought these daipers but they are not very absorbent. I got some from the hospital when We were discharged those daipers were awsome. I had the same problem with my first baby and I had t go find those pamper daipers from target. The price is very good on Amazon but I am not very pleased with the product. It doesnt absorb much and then the baby is wet and in winter changing clothes frequently for new born is not fun.
1,"It is the worst risk management book I have ever read. Poor organization and explanation, make the matter difficult to be understood. It is a very disappointing book suggested by GARP. I am a CFA charter, I have good knowledge in most of the subjects, I still think difficult in reading this book because of its poor explanation."
2,"Purchased this dvd as a gift. It arrived well within the alloted time and was well packaged. Another good buy through Amazon, my place to shop! EP"
2,"I read this in high school and loved it. I'm reading it to my children now (the oldest is 7yrs) and they love it also. I think they would get more out of it in a year or two, but this is a must read! There is a reason it won an award!"
1,"Tom Brokaw (and a squadron of 'helpers') produced a bombastic, windy book that is a disservice to the superb stories that he is trying to tell.The book is at its best when Brokaw lets the individuals tell their own stories, with a minimum of his commentary intruding. The peoples' stories are poignant, vivid, and worth reading.The problem is, you have to wade through Brokaw's creaking prose to get to the good stuff. Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories. Rotten job of trying to package them."
1,"The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!"
1,"This textbook has the most mistakes I have ever seen in a textbook. How can ASQ (the ""American Society for Quality"") recommend this as a study guide??. I just took the SSBB exam and this book was not helpful for my preparation. The (simulated) exam questions are much more focused on calculations than the actual test. I could not even find some concepts, names and tools from the test in the glossary."
1,"As nice as it looks, it was a disappointment. It doesn't slope to make the water drain into the sink, the edge is so sharp it cut my finger and last but not least, that ""tire rubber"" smell has not left after multiple washings. I've since been on the lookout for a better one."
1,"This dress adds 100 lbs, i swear. It is a good price, but you would look better naked. It is unfortunate, but please save yourself and do not purchase this dress."
2,"I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors ""outdated"" views on homosexuality - this is their opinion. Homosexuality is definitely an identity crisis and professional help should most definitely be sought immediately. There should be no doubt that individuals with a gay or bisexual agenda wrote the careless and irresponsible comments above. On the whole, the book is excellent. If you don't agree with page 144 just tear it out and your done."
1,"Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening."
2,"These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts. Recording sound also leaves something to be desired."
2,"I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS. EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU."
1,okay so there is no 23 episodes. the seller only gave me a disc with 3 episodes. what a scam? don't buy from this person again.
1,"I have owned these boots for years. They are very good Quality and very Comfortable. They lasted me winter after winter. In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times. Now for the pair I ordered, not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer. The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove. Assuming they were the same, I purchased a pair from Amazon (which is priced excellent) but they did not fit proper at all. The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something... and are no longer the same. Which is too bad. So as far as Amazon goes... ""flawless as usual"" Returning them was not a problem. Just beware of these boots. Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON, CANADA :)"
1,"I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain."
1,"I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least."
1,Have had for over 1 year - rice kept great at first for up to 3/4 days!!! But not sure what happened and the rice starts to Spoil if left overnight. Had it for about 2.5 years now and really upset about how many batches of rice I've had to throw out. I tried cleaning it with bleach consistently to kill bacteria and that helps through one or two cycles but the same Problem comes up again and again. Doesn't last for 15 years like old cooker my mom had that was probably a fraction of cost.
2,"This is another great continuation of the Buffy series. If you have seen the film and the series that sprang from it then you will love this.Go out and buy it. I have and i don't regret it for a second, and neither will you!"
1,"Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass."
2,"I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!"
2,"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."
2,"Jeff's book ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"" will stand the test of time. Although it has some minor editing problems, the content has character and vision. This parent's insights will be respected for the honesty and love that underlies the effort. I liked Jeff's poetry and pictures of his son at the end of the book. This added a very nice personal touch. I recommend the book to parents of autistic children and to all parents. I was inspired by his honesty."
1,"I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
2,"This diapers stand by their description. My baby has been dry, dry. It hold all the overnight pee and haven't had any accidents. Love them, not bulky and can tell when my baby is wet in mediately by touching it as the texture of the diaper changes."
1,"the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price."
1,"Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
2,"The book Of Mice And Men by: John Steinbeck was a pretty good book, not the best i have seen but pretty good. In the story there are two hobo's named Lennie(retarted) and George(sane). They have a dream of living off the fat of the land. They go arould the country looking for jobs to get a little bit of money for some support. They end up at a ranch working with alot of guys their age and enjoying the stay, but not for long. Lennie has been getting george in trouble all of his life, and now was not any different. In the end Lennie kills Curly's wife and George has to kill him. In the end, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head, with Carlson's gun. I would recomend this book to everyone who likes funny, but depressing books, John Steinbeck is a very good writer."
2,"Before ""Foundation"" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."
2,"This is one of the funniest books that I've encountered in some time. All Harry wants to do is take a little boat trip, maybe do some fishing, and relax. If page one is an indication of the things to come, it's not good news for Harry. We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going ""Mmmmmmmmmmm"". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up. A good number of titles out there can have the reader laughing on the first page but, can't deliver. This one does.Poor Harry!!!"
1,"More like Measure of a Queen. Clay Aiken releases her first full disc with much fanfare and hype, too bad she doesn't deliver. Each song is painstakingly boring and just used as a vehicle for her to try and recapture the Idol glory days. If only this disc really were ""Invisible,"" then we'd all be a lot happier. The only thing more excrutiatingly bad than this is the fear that soon we will have Reuben Chubs dropping his CD. Please Idols disappear!"
2,"This movie has received a lot of unfair criticism. Mostly, the problem is that this movie derrived from a video game. Some people dislike it because it comes from a video game and others hate it because it is too unlike the game. Admittedly, if there were some name and costume changes, this movie could be called something besides ""Super Mario Bros."".In any case, how good would the movie be if it featured a little plumber running through a bunch of turtles and jumping on to a flagpole? If it were too similar to the video game, many viewers would turn away (however, its unlikeness to the game has turned away some gamers). In any case, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. The characters are spirited and, as it says on the box, it's a blast to watch."
1,"I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
2,"I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon. As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien. Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions. The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for."
1,"I hate this gun. It barely shoots fifteen feet at about 50 feet per second. It looks and shoots cool, but it really sucks. I don't recomend it at all"
1,"This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
1,"The Amazon return period expired on Feb. 7Almost to the day two months later the ball i was comfortably sitting on at worked popped and deflated and landed me on the floor during a business meeting.Embarrassed? A little. Especially because I have been telling everybody int the office hwo great this ball is and how well it works for me.I will return it to Amazon and will send e message to the manufacturer. Fortunately nobody was hurt.I hope the company will replace the ball without any problems, especially since there were no sharp objects involved and I think I am not too heavy at 195 lb.I'll continue writing when I receive a reply from the manufacturer or Amazon."
2,"The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time. It makes us think of the world in the book, and inevitably compare it with ours. 1984 stands as one of my all-time favourite. And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16."
2,I am a history buff so the movie was just great. The love they ended up with is not found in this world anymore.
2,"This is the last good show that MTV ever made. Unfortunately, they only lasted one season; by the time it aired, MTV's audience had become too stupid to keep this show afloat. Suffice to say that the show is excellent, and nonstop laughs. It is very clever, and I have purchased a copy for myself, and continue to purchase more, to give out as gifts for xmas and birthdays."
2,"Having not purchased SOAD's first cd, I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song ""Sugar."" When ""Spiders"" became a hit, I was genuinely surprised. When I first heard ""Chop Suey,"" then learned it was from them, I knew 3 songs were no fluke. I picked up this cd the day it came out, and I must say, I have been greatly impressed by this cd. The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me, and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming. I can't wait to hear the next offering from these guys, hopefully they can step it up one more notch."
1,"This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund."
1,"We ran out of Earths Best and so I got some of these at Walgreens to hold us over. I am simply shocked that these diapers leak very badly over half the time. I was expecting these to perform better than Earths Best simply because they've been in business for so much longer and can use all the fancy chemicals. That was not the case at all. I can't believe these diapers are still on the market. It's like they have holes in them. Our son does like the Elmo image, though."
1,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
2,"this is a different kind of movie and I love it. so very glad I found and ordered it. it's amazing. this came securely wrapped, great delivery, and quality dvd satisfied with service, and movie"
2,"Pepe Aguilar, is one of a kind the way he sings makes one feel every word. The heart he puts into his music ( sentimiento ). I love his music, He is the WOW! for singers. Any song Ranchera, Balada, Banda. I have yet to hear a song that will not be done to excellence if he sings it. I Love Pepe."
1,"I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get."
1,This product although is a very good idea is cheaply constructed and the clips that hold the trash bag in place are very hard to get on and off and you end up ripping the trash bag. Keep your twenty bucks and give it to one of your kids as payment to hold that trash bag for you.
2,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK A LOT, BEING A MCGREGOR FAN MYSELF,BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT IT HAD MORE INFO ON HIM AND NOT AS MUCH ON HIS FILMS AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM. OVER ALL, THE BOOK WAS GOOD AND HAD A LOT OF INTERESTING FACTS IN IT AND ANY EWAN MCGREGOR FAN WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT HE IS PRETTY HOT IN THE COLOR PICTURES IN THE BOOK!"
1,This episode is a diappoinment. how can you say this episode makes you feel warm and fuzzy. it made me feel cold & icey. it think this was a supper depressing episode. WARNING! THIS EPISODE MAKES YOU FEEL ANGERY & DEPRESSED! do not watch this episode if your watching the show for the first time. watch Aurora Borealis this epsiode makes you warm & Fuzzy.
2,"Not many cd's can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Version 2.0, however, is one of the elite few who will have you praying for Garbage's next cd! So every one, go out there and buy this cd cause it has to be the best I have ever heard!"
1,"What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!"
2,"Gillain, a shy girl, is rescued from near death by an angel.The Angel helps Gillain get things she never had, like poularityand the attention from a guy she likes, whose name is David (which has a girlfriend). Angel tells Gillain to hurt people to get what she wants. it gets to the point where Gillain can't take it anymore and she wants him to go away. Gillain gets into alot of trouble with Angel and doesn't know how to make him go away. So what Gillain does is she...*Want to know the rest, read the book and you'll find out*I'ts a really good book!"
2,"Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."
1,"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film."
1,"I hate the book. It was the worst thing i've ever seen! What ever you do, do NOT buy this book!!!"
2,"It was a good book with a good lesson. I just prefer 1,2,3 Magic (Effective Discipline for Children 2-12) by Thomas W. Phelan, PhD."
2,Love this coffee mug warmer. It's wide enough to fit my large based coffee mug and is small enough that it can sit anywhere on my desk without really getting in the way.I'm giving this 4 stars because I wish it had either an automatic shut off after 3 hours or a 3rd option (besides on/off) to turn itself off after an hour. One time I left work and accidentally left it running with a 1/4 cup of coffee on it and by the next morning it had reduced the liquid down to a thick syrup. Coffee reduction sauce anyone??
1,"Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
1,"Well, it starts out well. The conceit of email sex is skillfully done. In fact, the sexy emails are the only good thing about this book, and when the author unwisely moves away from them, about mid-way through the book, the entire thing falls flat. Aside from the emails, the book is filled with unbelievable characters engaging in anatomically dubious acts described in trite sentences - over and over and over and over. By the end the book has degenerated into a mash of plot-driven pseudo S&M.;Other people's reactions to this book are proof positive that the genitals and the brain are not connected."
2,Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it.
2,"I was given this CD as a gift. I have enjoyed it for a long time. I would also recommend the ""Spoken In Love"" CD. Since it was given as a gift, I then purchased additional copies to give out to anyone interested in John Brown or Harpers Ferry."
1,"Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry."
1,"30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
1,"How could they have sunk so low? This is the ultimate sell-out album. It's not even good dance music, if that's what Queen was trying to do here. If they were trying to appeal to a different audience, I'd like to know who that audience was. Nobody in their right mind can acutally enjoy this garbage. Synths and Queen mix like oil and water. Bring back the mid-seventies Queen albums."
1,"I love the 1632 series. I have bought every book as soon as the come out, and enjoyed each immensely. This is not a novel in the normal definition. It is a collection of stories, kind of like the Gazette, except the Gazette is interesting. I was bored frankly with the stories. I normally read a book in less than a day, but this one took me over 4 days, because i just could not get interested, I just finished it to keep me in the story and to ensure I would not miss anything for future books."
1,"I wish I could give this 0 stars. I got this for my Palm TX, but as another reviewer experienced, the damn case wouldn't close!! The screw on the back doesn't seem very stable either. I just sent BoxWave an email complaining about this and demanding all of my money back, including shipping charges. What a crappy product. I think I'm going to try the Rhinoskin one instead."
2,"This book is a beautiful biographical story by the person who lived it. The story is wonderfully entertaining from beginning to end. It makes you want more from her continuing to live in the Cal. mountains as an elderly woman with ""young legs"".David Brokaw"
2,"I bought this strictly for decoration. Its really nice, better quality than I expected!! Has a nice weight to it and seems extremely durable for sure. Highly recommend!"
2,Talk about a hokey plot and cheezy acting -- this movie is GREAT !! The 1980's will never be forgotten as a decade of some really sad movies. My God does George Clooney look young and with that mop of hair..... Can't wait to see The Killer Tomatoes take France.
1,"I only used Swaddlers and Crusers since my baby was born. Recently I wanted to try the BabyDry because they were a little cheaper. This was a BIG mistake. The babydry don't stay dry at all, especially not as long as 12 hours as advertised. It would stay dry for 4 hours maybe. These things leak (not overflow); that is it I sit my baby on my lap, after a while my pants will be wet. Moreover 90% of the time the bed will be wet in the morning, unless the baby cries in the middle of the night and I use that occasion to change her.In the end these babydry diapers are MORE EXPENSIVE than the Cruisers due to the fact that I have to change my baby a lot more often. I will NOT buy these babydry diapers again."
2,"For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery. This book fills that gap admirably. It reveals how Jozef Pilsudski was truly the founding father of a reborn nation. This is his story just as much as Poland's, but then the two are so closely tied together that their's is one story. A fascinating and easy read. Thoroughly recommended to those who have an interest in this area."
2,"For the price, u cant beat this deal. the adapter works perfectly and havent had any problems whatsoever. Only thing is u HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS UTILITY that comes with it. other than that, the thing simply WORKS."
1,"If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
2,"I too read this book quickly, staying up one night until 2 or 3 in the morning, and I was riveted. I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young."
1,the first time i slipped them on the side seams started to tear so much that the dirt on the inside started to fall out and i had to hand sew the seam back together
1,"An excellent book that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bought the paperback for less than $3, yet Amazon & the greedy publisher think I'd be dumb enough to pay $13 for the Kindle ebook??? Was thinking about buying a Kindle. After looking at the Kindle prices of most books still covered by copyright, though, I definitely will not. I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy. Besides a truly backward price, with a Kindle version I'd also lose the ability to do any of the following: lend out my books anytime I want to anybody I choose, donate them to libraries or secondhand stores, or trade them in for credit towards other books at a used bookstore. Net result: current ebooks = epic FAIL on value."
2,"I saw this movie over a dozen times & enjoy it everytime. Some viewers confuse this movie as a HORROR movie, & they expect to see blood & massacre on screen. But this is certainly not Polanski style. This one keeps you in suspense until the end of the movie. If you have read the book, you appreciate how Polanski directed the movie true to the essence of the novel. The dream sequence is exactly how IRA LEVIN wrote in his book & Polanski did a good job. There are too many young audiences nowadays only look for 'blood & terror' in movies & don't appreciate such a fine film. They better off just watch the cheap flicks...."
2,"This meter is a versatile meter for testing of electrical components. It is not rated for branch-circuit or service application, and that does limit it's functionality some. But for bench testing of components and devices it works great."
2,"There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over the world. If you listen to this second cd of this band (Toxicity), you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going. I don`t quite know what category this band (System Of A Down) fits into, maybe it's Nu-metal. For me, this album is simply the best albun of 2002. Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style. I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time, because the album has just been released. I suggest you give this cd a try, and when you find out that you love it, spread the sickness to your friends."
2,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS I EVER SAW. VISUALY STUNNING. IF YOUR A FAN OF GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY DO NOT MISS OUT!!!!!!!!! THIS FILM WON THE OSCAR IN THAT CATEGORY FOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN 1970.
2,"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."
1,"I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!"
2,"I looked everywhere for a nice, simple design. I must have browsed hundreds of different styles. Anchor Hocking's Bolera set is just right - simple but not obviously.The glass is just wide enough for cleaning thoroughly by hand and the bottom has a nice weight to it as well - not easy to knock over. The sides aren't terribly fragile, but they're not uncommonly sturdy either. I have broken a few."
1,"It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
1,"I enjoyed Berry's two other novels, despite reading reviews which complained that both books were too far-fetched and improbable. I do not mind suspending reality to read a book or to watch a movie, but this book took things a little too far! I am Catholic, and maybe that is why I found Berry's third secret revealed at Fatima and subsequently hidden by the Church too unbelieveable. There were several parts to the secret, and if Berry would have limited its scope, the book would have been more compelling and believeable. The portion of the secret that deals with motherhood is just totally improbable and Berry just goes too far with it. Also, it is too trite that the villian in the novel is always able to figure out the protagonist's next step. This book starts off well, but attempts to accomplish too much, which makes it difficult for the reader to suspend reality and enjoy the story."
2,"I bought this movie at best buy,and it is AWESOME!!!!!! There was this really funny part, but I'm not going to spoil the movie. Patrick is so funny! You should really see this movie. You won't be sorry!P.S. I'm a goofy goober! :)"
1,"A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book."
1,"In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago."
2,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
2,"This book takes place in Soledad,CA. It taking about two migrant workers Lennie and George. George is ""small and quick and dark of face"". ""Lennie, a huge man has the mind of a young child"". George like a father that taking care his trouble son Lennie. Lennie is a trouble maker, he made a lot of trouble. Finally George can't help Lennie and he use a gun point on the back of lennie's head.Read on to find out what happened next.I give this book 5 stars, beacuse I like John Steinbeck's books."
2,"This album is all we have been waiting for and can be listened to by all. I bought enough to give for gifts and didn't even wait for giving them out, just had to let everyone hear them NOW. All the ages, from pre-teen up to this older lady love this man, Clay Aiken and his high ideals show through. We appreciate as fans what he has done, to make his album family friendly as he did the Idol show on tour. This is a Star, make no mistake. He will be the greatest along in a world that has ruined music for anyone that wants to hear actual music. Listening to some of the things on radio is just too darn tedious, as some is just noise and other is plain garbage. Not so with Clay Aiken's music. Thank God for Clay Aiken."
2,What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
2,Works from 4 rooms away and through several walls. Not as fast as maybe you would like but it works. 30 minute TV show might take 15 minutes. Typical movie will take longer...I clocked mine at about 40 minutes sometimes faster depending on the qulity you recorded the movie at...higher quality will certainly be a larger file and take longer. Leaves a copy of the origional on the tivo the file was transfered from. Also great not to have to have a phone line connected once you get this connected to your broadband network. I use a Linksys wireless B/G router and I have one Linksys wireless range extender which I am sure helped this thing reach 4 rooms away. Wish it were faster and had longer range ability but that is the limit of G/G wireless...we need N wireless and an N device from Tivo or whoever makes this for them.
1,"I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
2,"Just to beware, this single does not have a B side to it. Just a remix of the Big Boy song, but still, I love Die Happy, so."
1,"I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
2,"Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Keeps warm beverages warm. No, it will not heat a cold cup of coffee nor will it keep your beverage at scalding temperatures. But if you put your mug on it will your drink is still at least lukewarm, this doo-dad will keep it warm enough so that it's still pleasant to drink. To give you an idea of how hot this thing gets, the plate is warm enough that it *could* burn you if you left your hand on it, but will not burn with a quick touch."
1,"This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
1,"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book I was sadly disappointed!Cardboard characters and unbelievable plot, hardly worth the price of the book. A major sorespot indeed!!!"
1,Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
1,"This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast."
1,"Horrible horror misfire that lacks a lot of brains and lacks a credible leading man for the movie to really fly. While Keanu Reeves is miscast in the worse way, it's Rachel Weisz who steps up to the plate and carries the movie into respectability. Her performance is much better than the story and the special effects that is in this film and for that, the movie is bearable but other than her grand effort to transcend the lousy script, there is really nothing to see here other than her performance.Wait for Dvd."
1,This is an absolutely atrocious album. Do not waste your time or money. I will use it for target practice with my .44 Magnum.
1,I am a veteran of WWII and was very disappointed in this book. It is totally devoid of emotion. Brokaw generates no real sympathy for his characters and the result is much like reading a dull history book filled with statistics. With the subject matter available he should have been able to bring many tears to the eyes of the reader. I suggest Brokaw read Flags of Our Fathers to discover what real writing is all about.
1,"Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
2,Loved it so much I read it over and over. I meditate a lot easier now and I tried the pendulum and it really works if you ask the right questions. I would recommend this book to anyone who is spiritual.
1,This is a concise version of the book but not the original book. Even i can't return it since there is no return policy. Accidentally i placed 2 books but i didn't find any option to cancel it. Even i tried contacting the sellers but no use.
2,"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."
1,"I would like to give this movie no stars but it was not an option. Don't be fooled by the indie reviews and look of this film. It is HORRIBLE! I'm a huge John Waters fan and enjoy camp and ""bad"" movies. Even John Waters would be bored with this one. The director spent too much time on looooong shots and scenes that go nowhere. Repetitive dialogue from the main character also gets annoying. Too bad! The movie could have had great potential but failed at the hands of an un-creative director."
2,"This book just cries for a continuation. once started it is difficult to put down. I am lucky that i have the orginal paperback edition, that despite many readings is still in good condition. It helps if you know a bit about Indian religions."
2,a bit small then i would like but it was nice. Got it for my son's History class and it worked out great
2,"What else is there to say? Before all the commercial success, unnecessary hype and unhealthy agitation around the band, this little gem rocked my stereo. Much less Beatles-influenced than their second album this one is also much more electric, filled with Noel's pentatonic solos, repetitive but fun, and cool seventies-sounding riffs. Anyhow, in my opinion, Oasis hasn't been able to surpass this LP yet and probably won't ever be able to. Start your collection here."
2,"""The Black Arrow"" is R. L. Stevenson at his best. With a smooth, proper style Stevenson creates complex, conflictive characters in an adventure full of emotion and thrills. For anyone who likes adventure, this novel is going to be one of his/her favorites because in this book Stevenson combines beauty with danger."
2,I love him...but I have to admit I'm kinda growing up and he's not growing with me. It's good but not his best. My favorite song is I Mean (I Don't Mean It)...totally tight!
2,This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city. Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do. I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years. Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story.
1,"I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing."
2,"I ordered 4 copies from Amazon and hate to give any away as I planned so will buy more to have one in every car and room. It is absolutely amazing and please don't listen to the remnants of Ruben's fans who are rating Clay badly because they are still disappointed that ""their"" hero will go nowhere.Every song is outstanding, just as Clay is and it is overwhelming that he can do so fantastic on so many songs in such a short time. Keep up the good work Clay and millions are rooting and supporting you. Was at the Houston and Dallas tour and the experience will be remembered a lifetime. Alainapoo"
2,"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."
2,"My favorite of all her CD's. What a wonderful voice. LOVE her Billie Holiday covers, but mostly love ""Hey John,"" which i understand is to be about John Lennon. Buy this CD, i doubt you will regret it!"
1,"I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible"
2,"The film was all set up for a sequel, but it never came. Maybe that's not such a bad thing considering the Matrix and Prophecy sequels. This is a classic!"
2,Is excellent. I recommend it with your eyes closed. The trouble was that my edition came ugly and battered.
2,This vest in very cool. Looks nice and is comfortable to wear. Lots of pockest for all sorts of stuff. Also has several velcro and button spots available for expanding and cusotmizing.
2,"As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs."
1,This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
1,My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
2,"It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Unfortunately, the only effective chemical solution is chlorine which acts more or less on its own but cannot be used with this machine. Safe cleaners, such as Simple Green are no more effective than when used without them. Other than that, it's a great product."
1,"I'm a 10 yead old boy who loves to read! but I totally hate this book. It was a summer reading assignament from school (4th grade). Nothing happens in 148 pages of boaring, repetitive and monotonus writing.They say things over and over again. This book is lable as an Eco mistery, but it seams to me like an encyclopedia type of reading. To much unnecesary information.I would not recomend this book at all."
1,"Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop's battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed.It could keep the computer operating while plugged in, but it wouldn't charge my battery. I've seen other reviews with different results, but for me, this thing was pretty much useless."
1,"This was the worst of three movies, because of how they messed with the violence, and made the movie PG-13. What made the first two movies good was the great gore that made them feel more realistic then what was presernted here. Here there is no gore, but very little action scenes with almost no physical violence at all. This was the worst mistake that Orion made, because as a result this movie flopped with just 10 million at the box office after being shelved for two years, and took down the entire studio with it. Peter Weller should've been in this movie, because it would've been alot better movie. Some people say that this movie is better than Robocop 2, because it has less violence, and focuses more on the story which is true as it does so, but overall this movie is nothing more than a major disappointment."
2,"This book was on the requirement list to enter Honors English I in my town's high school. I found the book very intriguing. It shows you both life at its worst, and at its best. (Please don't ask me to elaborate :) !) The book also gives you an outlook on human nature as a whole. I found this book to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the priviledge to read."
1,This is one of the worst Cd's I've ever heard. This chick is garbage and so's this cd. Don't waste your money on this one. Chopper Girl...haha....more like wack as hell girl. I didn't even wanna give you one star but I had to.
1,The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons which made a lousy non-Christmas present and I have no refund 6 weeks to-date..
1,"Our 8 year old son ACHED for this toy for his birthday and although we thought it to be expensive junk, we wanted to see him happy. The FIRST one we returned thinking it was broken but soon realized with the SECOND one that we just weren't shaking it hard or long enough. After a week of trying to figure this thing out, the screen has gone fuzzy and even a new battery could not revive it. Even our 8 year old is disgusted and frustrated with the quality of this toy. It is going back tomorrow - at our son's request. If your little boy wants this toy, please show him this review and suggest he pick something else. It's just an expensive disappointment. Please read the review by Diane. She says it so much better than we ever could."
2,"This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs"
2,"i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn't. i guess reading through the reviews here says the same thing: this doesn't try to be the kind of music my mother would like (or some of my coworkers). but that must be obvious if you listen to the samples amazon provide.but otherwise, this is pretty sweet - it strikes a nice balance between playing with new ideas/sounds on the one hand and keeping a steady groove on the other. ""commerical experimental"" in a good way - and i think that's a very challenging target.as for the politics and trying to second guess whether this woman is ""for real"" - it doesn't matter unless you don't like the music. good music doesn't need to (and usually doesn't) match my politics. why on earth should it? if you don't like the music, fair enough. but to argue that you don't like music because of the attitude or the politics - what's with that? you're confusing music with something else, i think."
2,"Batman Begins a new generation of Batman movies and if this movie is anything to go on the movies to come will be worth watching and buying. In this movie the as the title states shows the beginning of Batman from where Bruce Wayne was before to how he decided to use the bat and because ""Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread"" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman. I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled. But I eagerly await the release of the sequel"
1,"how can you people listen to this? this is so awful. i can't stand this... abomination. the pace is so gruelingly slow. i dont mind slow songs every now and then, but jesus, this is slower than slow. these guys give a new meaning to the word slow. it may be a little bit more listenable if they picked up the pace just a little bit. but its so slow, how can they even play that slow, its so mindnumbing, i cant stand it, it drives me insane. its so dark, and its also frightening. i just cannot listen to it. the only reason i checked this horrific disc out is because it got such rave reviews. call me what you will, but i would not recomend this to anybody. i cannot see how anybody could like this. its so awful."
1,Filled with a bunch of Chi Shmmee mystical crap. Lots of BS filler to make it to the publisher's page quota. I can summarize this book's running advice for you in two words. LEAN FORWARD.Don't waist your money.
2,"I ordered this watch back in 2006. I wore it every day for the last 6 years and it had many hours in the pool/water and close to 100 dives on it, with one dive as deep as 137 feet back in 2008. Awesome watch. However, the last time I took it in to have the battery changed, the jeweler (I guess) didn't put it back together correctly and it flooded 2 weeks ago. So, it is no longer working. Although I did love this watch and it's smaller size (I'm not a large male with big wrists) I am going to purchase an automatic watch this time so I don't have rely on jewelers to change out the battery."
1,"Bian De Palma makesthe mistake of hiscareer by doing twothings. Making a judgement on a warhe doesnt understandand by counting onMichael J Fox to carry the film.Its such a whiney mess of a film that I use it to annoy my wife when she asks whats on television.Its actually that bad. Sean Penns acting in this film will go down in history as one of the great and mighty pieces of overacting and caricature. It will be used in acting classes for yrs to come as an example of how to butcher a part beyond recognition.I have read the reviews for this film and am astounded that one single positive review was written.A biased,lousy mess that will be forgotten. Look at what its selling for used and you will see for yourself."
1,"This is the worst printer i have ever had! Every time i tried to print some thing, it's paper jam, paper jam, and paper jam. stay away! if you want a printer scanner copier, get the psc 1610. lasted my 5 years!"
1,Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.
2,"This is a great CD! Ten originals along with excellent remakes of ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and ""I Can't Hold Hold Out"", both of which the band has molded into their own while keeping true to the original. Fans of Babylon AD will certainly not be disappointed!"
1,"if you like history books read this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afro\amer. after the civil war"
2,"The illustrations are just beautiful, I will use the book to teach my students the beautiful song of the same title."
2,"Sodom Came, they went.I had listened to 'Masquerade In Blood' and 'Till Death Do Us Unite' and I knew the war that was Sodom was over, the ceasefires had been signed. When you end an album with a song called ""Hey Hey Rock 'n' Roll Star"" after putting out crap that just screams ""We wanna be punk and are failing miserably at it!"" I knew it was over. Saddened, I went to survey the damage.And That's when I heard the Air Raid Sirens.Code Red is the comeback album of all time. Sodom has snapped back into place, I don't know why, but they're rocking harder and heavier than they ever have. This is not for ""Limp Bizkit"" fans, you get your ears and a greater part of your head ripped off and handed to you. And that's the way it should be.Notable Tracks are Liquidation, The Vice of Killing, Code Red, and Addicted to Abstinance."
2,"We got tired of the ridiculous cost of digital cable and paired this TiVo with basic cable (the basic, basic cable with only the first 20 or so channels). Now, we record and watch some of the quality shows on ""regular"" TV and we are going to sign up for Amazon.com's digital movie rentals and our TiVo will access from them from our computer.Our cable recorder was not reliable at all. It didn't record all of the shows we set up and sometimes you couldn't access the shows that it did record. It has been wonderful using our new TiVo!! It has been 100% reliable with recording and playing shows. With our wireless adapter, TiVo connected easily with our computer, where we can access our digital movies, images, etc.The TiVo on-screen menu is very user-friendly and there are plenty of videos from TiVo to help get you acquainted with many of its features. We think it is so much easier to locate and record a show with the TiVo compared to our cable TV's service."
1,I've had to replace the ear cushions twice already at a price of $35.00 plus tax. The cushions come apart in less than 2 years of use.
2,"This cd serves up a little bit of everything. Traditional gospel, contemporary gospel and few toe tapping get your praise on songs and overall a enjoyable praise experience. Musically its so diverse, a little Coltrane here, a little Thomas Whitfield there, it's got so many flavors you're sure to find a song you really like."
1,She's featured on Time Warner cable commercials in West Tennessee. Her voice is actually quite irritating and the fact she is promoting this CD on an ad in this manner is a huge turn-off.
1,"If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating."
2,We have here a True Measure of a Man. This CD just shows what a great voice Clay has. He appeals to ages 7 to70. He has proved everytime just how versatile he is. I can't wait until his next single comes out Solitare/The Way. I have already pre-ordered and so should you. Lets give this young man a huge Hand.
1,"Two years, and this is all we get? The first song is decent. It has some rap/reggae guy doing his vocal thang, with RDJ's music behind the background. Except for the first 10 seconds, the music itself exceptional. Nice crazy d'n'b stuff with vocals. This song is worth getting, but not for $$$ ! The other two tracks... they are just noise. It's as if he hooked up electrodes to his recording equipment and twiddled with the knobs or something. Or maybe he had real songs and then encrypted them. Who knows! They are not music. They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ."
2,"Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room."
2,"Well, on the plus side it has great sound and good picture the ability to expand the memory and an FM radio(iPods don't have this feature). The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly. Overall this is a good product."
2,I am a country and western fan in Memphis. This new Sony product is great! I meam really great. I don't have to remember songs I hear on the radio anymore. Definitely worth the $19.99 I paid. Get one!
2,This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
1,"just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger.All this charger does is allow me to turn on the computer (sometimes), it does NOT charger my powerbook g4."
2,Love the look and quality. But coffee filters for a regular sized coffee maker do not fit in the filter compartment.
2,"This book was on the summer reading list for 9th graders. It was really hard to find in the bookstore, for it was bought as soon as it was brought in...and my teacher let me borrow hers. Anyway, I read it then, couldn't get past the first page. Then, MONTHS later, I read it.....and fell in love with it. It's a wonderful book, full of emotions. It isn't afraid to show the view of real life, with all its hardships and happiness. I love this book so much, I didn't even return it to my teacher! I have to pay her back soon :) I read this at least 10 times! :D"
1,"This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them."
2,"If you eat rice then this is the cooker for you. The best feature, aside from the even cooking, is the timer that allows you to say when you want the rice done."
2,"This is a very polished CD-Clay has done an amazing job! Every song is quite good. I feel that anyone unfamiliar with Clay would be impressed with his smooth,soaring vocals. A very classy CD to be enjoyed!"
2,The first semi serious movie that i have seen played by Adam Sandler and co-stars Drew Barrymore and after watching the movie i found it to be better than i expected not only is the movie outragesly funny bad a rather sad side is added to the story enough to make some cry. The movie has the same humour as Adams previuos movies but it just as funny none the less.The movie starts with adams character going at with all the girls but dumping them soon after until one afternoon he finds himself visiting a calm ocean side restaurant where he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore) who day after day he would fall in love with until he has to think of an appropriate method for her to live her life the best she possibly can.#with a combination of witty and desgusting characters makes the movie a very enjoyable watch with the same original humour of previous Adam sandler movies but is just as enjoyable i would highly recommend you watching the movie yourself.
2,very interesting and good. so many years and still true! looks like statistics never change. should be read by everyone.
1,"Although this book was very well written, I couldn't understand it very well. I probably would not have finished it if it hadn't been required reading for school. I would think that older kids might be able to undertsand it, but that most of it is too subtle for eighth graders."
1,"I loved this movie that's why I ordered it. But it won't play in our player, it says something about a code."
1,"I used pampers swaddlers then switched to baby dry to save money. To me there is no comparison. I have never had a leak with the swaddlers. Almost every time I have put my baby in the baby dry, particularly at night, she wakes up with a wet onesie. I thought that it might be a size issue (maybe they were too big). But, I waited a couple of months and they are still leaking."
1,"Wavery-voiced pop icon Madonna and incomprehensible non-singer Banderas absolutely destroy this wonderful score. The orchestrations are hideous. Pass this one by, and get the Broadway version (a masterpiece) with LuPone(BRILLIANT!) and Patinkin."
2,"My 2 year old and 1 year old enjoy this alot. It is not something that we leave up all of the time due to space restrictions in our home. It works great for a rainy day or weekend. It is very quick to set-up and take down. It folds up very well for storageand would be very easy to pack in a suitcase and take on vacation. Its not the greatest quality product, but I do not know what other reviewers were expecting (maybe a backpacking tent for climbing Everest?). Overall, I am very satisfied, the construction has held up to pretty intense play, the kids enjoy it, and its ease of use make it a winner for us."
2,"I got this today. As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out. I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right. Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven. I had the big ""O"" in a minute (probably under) and it was so intense I was shaking. The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right. I don't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy wouldn't work after. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy. My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is."
2,"This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet."
2,"This is not a depiction of the ins and outs of the political aspect of Queen Victoria's reign. It is a love story where balancing duty with depth of feeling, professional with personal relationship, is fully fleshed out.All actors involved deliver great performances. Great chemistry between the lead actors makes the story come alive. It was wonderful to picture the castle, which looks so cold and austere from the outside, as the home of a warm and loving and joyful family. Children gleefully running through the halls on holidays. A father playing with his children. A mother looking on with shining eyes.This movie shows the personal side to the monarchy. It was a delight to watch. I hated to see it end.Add it to your DVD library and prepare yourself for a few hours of total enjoyment."
2,"While similar in premise to some of his other tales of worldshaking technological demigods, this book has some additional moral elements. Zelazny offers them plainly, evoking a feeling of religious historicism that makes some of the shinier platitudes more appropriate. He achieves this with decorous dialogue and a marvelous and nearly timeless portrayal of technological 'miracles' that are unfathomable to the hairy-knuckled masses. The sympathetic and chain-smoking antihero is also present, driving the archetypical story along a delineated route of demon-dealing and decadence. Zelazny's wordcraft is excellent, and this book should be well received by all but the most technophiliac of science fiction connoisseurs."
2,I am a big Steve Berry fan and have read all of his books. This one is controversial and makes you think about thesubject. Very well written and I look forward to reading his future books.
2,"This book was excellent. The charecters are very real. This book focuses on love and hate becuase Patty does something so incredible. She does something that will forever change her life. I would tell you but then I'd ruin the book. Ruth is also a great charecter becuase she really adds to the whole novel. This novel was sad yet I want to read it again and again. Patty (to me) is a true hero and at the end of the book I though to my self.....""you go girl."""
1,"I bought this item, along with the Squeem Miracle vest. I tried putting this on and it was so odd, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing it. I am 5'4"" and weigh 128. I usually wear a size 6. I ordered the medium size. I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight. However, the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs, they hung loosely. Now, I have saddle bags and my thighs are one of my biggest problem areas. But this was actually way too big to do anything for my thighs, compounded by the gapping crotch. I had great luck with the miracle vest and will be writing a review on that item."
1,"Like others I took a chance on this hoping for a different angle on a first person sim, or management fight game, and should really not have bothered. The gameplay is pretty straightforward, but even with a 256MB video card, the graphics are pretty bland, and the gameplay slow. It's also another game where there are too few levels of play to actually be able to achieve all the game has to offer. For example, there is a good interactive section of equipment, fighting slaves, upgrades and impressive array of weapons, but financial constraints and sheer playing time invloved make them almost inaccessible. Another main complaint would be (for me at least) an easy boredom threshold - this game could have, and should have been much better, despite the price."
2,We are thrilled to have received 'The Gaither Vocal Band: Homecoming' in excellent condition. This DVD is inspirational and a blessing to see/hear. I happily Ordered it secondhand through Amazon.com knowing that it would arrive in New Zealand promptly and without difficulty of any kind. We highly recommend this video confident that it will be a means of blessing to all who see/hear it. Thank you everyone concerned!
1,"I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."
1,"Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. ""Damn, he said to Kate, ""It's the Hazar Scouts, "" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"
1,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
2,Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal.
2,Beautiful and very helpful book for both the experienced and novice fishermen. Great pictures really make the book user friendly. Would make a great gift.
2,"We saw the Spongebob movie and it's the BEST from sponge bob!I won't spoil the movie for you but it's SOOOOOO FUNNY! Spongebob and Patrick's hangover on the ice cream, David Hasselhoff being used as a speed boat, and It's all hilarious. So see it!"
1,"I have read all the reviews, before, and again after, since my unit crapped out...It lasted 6 months, light use. The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers, never used all at once, maybe two pair, and it just crapped out after 6 months. The fuse wasn't blown, the lights still came on, it just stopped working. I had my doubts on a $100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true. I am looking at other brands now."
1,"this is the worst night world book that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. another reason why this book [is bad] the only part i like is that there's an apppearance by one of my fave characters of the series-ASh i swear he would be more funner 2 read if the book was only bout him!!! angel wasnt a good character either and david [wasn't either]!! i recommend teens 2 not by this book it really stinks alot!!"
2,Inflates fast. Nice shape when inflated stores well. Guest are getting a good nights rest. Would reorder if we need more.
2,"This book will show you how we all want to define God as we want to, not as God wants. You will see yourself in the pages of this book and hopefully, you will make an honest effort to rise above your restrictive defintion of God. If so, it will have expanded your understanding of your world. This is a good book for a class in spirituality to discuss."
1,"Let me start by saying that Clay should have won first place on American Idol, He was a thousand times better than everyone else and has a voice that far surpasses his peers.That said, this was a lousy effort on a first release, Clay became what Simon wanted all along..COMMERCIAL. He did not remain true to himself and that to me is a very sad thing, I am extremely disappointed!"
1,Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.
1,"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title ""fire-us"" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."
2,"This story was quite sad initially but turned out OK in the end, I always think it very sad when families cannot respect and like each other."
1,"Figured it had potential to be funny. But is wasn't, and not very interesting. Can't reccomend this movie to anyone."
2,"His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?"
2,"Like them. Very lite and comfortable. Dry. I'm a now-and-then day-hiker and had only worn them once in the woods. There was a problem of soreness under the top, inside gromets on both boots. Got a suggestion of re-stringing the top gromets from my daughter-in-law, and it worked when I wore them all day running around locally. Suggest including some alternative stringing techniques in shoe boxes."
2,"Words have been crafted in previous reviews which dwarf my abilities yet I must include the following information: ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress"" is one song which justifies the price of admission. No other singer has ever approached Glen's interpretation of this haunting tune. The song was included on Capitol's ""The Very Best of Glen Campbell"" Lp when originally released but was sadly missing when the album went to cd. Raven has given us the opportunity to hear not only the entire original album but has included a number of stunning bonus cuts as well. This cd is a treasure for all Glen Campbell-Jimmy Webb fans. Campbell's voice is as clear and plaintiff as ever and no words can describe Webb's genious. Listen for yourself. Hats off to Raven!"
1,"Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons. The episodes are tired and formulaic, and the ""surprise"" season finale is laughable. Continuity is thrown out the window and the storylines are fractured. Buy the first and second seasons to see the best of CSI."
2,"Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!"
1,"At first, I thought this was a parody of a boring way-too-wholesome children's book, but I was wrong. The sickening and soporific scenes keep stacking up into one giant sentimental sleeping pill. This is the same snooze-inducing drivel that has-been writing professors praise and perpetuate in the cookie-cutter MFA programs across the country."
1,"Kathy Reichs uses too much narrative for my taste. The main character, Tempe Brennan, is not particularly likeable and it is not clear why she chooses to do some of the things she does. For instance, what was the point of the ""mugging""? Why didn't she at least tell Ryan about it? Maybe I would understand had I finished the book. I feel betrayed by her weaving me into her life and then killing her cat. I am not an activist but I don't understand a writer who feels he/she needs to kill an animal for what? Shock effect? I understood the reason for the other deaths - even the babies - which were remote and had some purpose to the plot. But to make the reader feel warmth and love for Birdie, through her writing in both books, and then kill him? I didn't feel it worth my time to finish the book. Nor will I read another of hers."
1,"I am unable to put my hands thru the opening. The opening for the wrist is to small (approx 1 3/4 inches )and the weights are non adjustable. They may work best for someone who has very very small hands. But for the average size person I would not suggest these weights. Maybe the company should use stretchable material or add velcro to make them adjustable. I rated this product a 1 because of the feel of the material and the overall size of the weights. I am going to assume that if I could get them on, they would be very comfortable."
1,"Good God! This was the first book of Ms. Garwood I ever looked at and I swear it will be my last! I can't believe something so shallow and unbelievably cheezy still gets published! All the characters do is look at each other, sigh, rapidly hug and kiss and realize over and over and over that they are in love...It was so tacky I couldn't force myself to finish. This is housewife's bliss! All that's missing is Fabio on the cover."
2,"Nice ideas.., able to pick up some excellent refreshers and tips.., more like ""PhysiologyRunning""..A possible scenario would be incorporating anyone's spiritual background into running.., drawing parralels.., not just Taoism..."
2,"I've reviewed a couple of other Waechtersbach items, and I'm quite happy with these as well! I have only two minor complaints. First, on these, the glaze seems to be scratching (utensils?) more than the other Waechtersbach products I have...my plates and cereal bowls aren't doing that. Second, all four of them had a funny little bump on the outside rim...it looked identical on all four. Maybe a slight manufacturing defect? The glaze is slightly darker around the bump, so you can see it, though it's not overly obvious. But overall I love them - they're great for soups and pasta (spaghetti especially). They're holding up quite well in the dishwasher, too - no chips or cracks, despite how they sort of lean against one another. Very pleased!"
2,"After reading past reviews, I was prepared to have to download special 64-bit drivers to make this card work with Vista 64-bit. But they weren't needed: Vista 64 automatically got the drivers from Windows Update, and I was connected to my WPA network in minutes. Never needed the MSI installation disk or the drivers I'd downloaded.Card itself works find, excellent signal strength. The little antenna is fine, although I may wind up velco-ing it to the case."
2,Love these and easy to use. You really can not put it though twice though if you mess up. I have only used it on a laser printer because that's what it says it's for. Awesome price so I don't wince too much when I mess up. I'll only buy these from now on.
1,Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example: p50. Q6. Which of the following acids are polyprotic? Acetic; Sulphuric; Hypochlorous; Nitric; all of the above. Answer: Carbonic! PLEASE! Chemistry is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse.
1,"Let me see were should I start. Once again my room-mate actually went out and brought this c.d.(why). All I can say is come on america, people out there actually like this dude. I like to tell it how it is and this c.d. blows. From the start to the end of this mess is like pouring salt on an open wound. He sings like a girl and looks sick. What I really want back is the time I spent losing my life listing to this crap. I also see that he doesn't have to much talent, there are only like 2 songs on here. That is why I love P2P so much. Overall I think clay should be soaped up and made to sing in a prison shower."
2,"This series is, for me, stronger when Hornblower is a young officer learning his craft and developing his skill base. This was a book I enjoyed and which prompted me to continue with the series to the end."
2,"Dr. Napier was my primary Old Testament professor and mentor at Yale Divinity School and ""Come Sweet Death"" comprised some of his imaginative chapel sermons in which he marvelously moves from the Biblical text into our cultural/social arena, applying the truths of Genesis to us. One must have some awareness of the Genesis text and scholarship of Gerhard von Rad and his American disciples, of whom Davie Napier is one; but Napier goes beyond von Rad in his interpretive skills and possesses unique insights. I use it as a resource text in my university/theological seminary courses. A must for the Biblical interpreter in a time when our sermons and commentaries are so flat and unexciting."
1,"I'm a little peeved I been using Pampers Nany-Dry for 2 Years, unannounced the company that makes Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers has made a major design change to Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (they seem more like Huggies) - much more elastic, narrower straps and much less absorbent material. It's hard to make it thru the night without a diaper change now!"
2,"Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL."
2,"I have been reading Julie Garwood ever since The Secret was first written and I have been eagerly anticipating Ramsey's story. I loved the book - but I could not help feeling a bit disappointed that Ms. Garwood did not include more of a rich tale about Ramsey and Bridgid. If she had to have two romances in one book, I know that I would have bought a book that was twice as long with equal emphasis on both romances.Ms. Garwood, if you read this, please continue with your Scottish romances - I am now fascinated by the Highlands and its brave, courageous people!"
2,I did a lot of looking before purchasing this rack. I ended up buying it at a local bike shop because I wanted to see it first. I have a Honda Accord coupe - 2 door - and the fit is just right for the car. We also have a van and the abiltiy to work on both is very handy. Setup is easy and the bikes are held firmly. I had used another rack previously that was loaned by a friend. It was very unstable compared to the Saris Bones.....
2,"I sit on this ball as an alternative to a desk chair. I use this ball many hours a day, at 190lbs. Besides slowly and decidedly building up my core muscles this ball is also used for situps, extension and flexion work. It is a great price and a solid product."
2,"If anyone is going through the hell of being stalked, or even think they are being stalked, they MUST by Detective Proctor's book ""How to Stop A Stalker""I have read other ""stalking"" books, and they have been helpful, but none to the extent of Detective Proctor's book.The information, the suggestions, everything is a MUST for someone being stalked.He UNDERSTANDS, something that I didn't feel from the other stalking books.Detective Proctor knows the reality and horror of stalking in an easy read and extremely informative book.This book is up to date (unlike some of the other Stalking books) and my only problem is that he doesn't have a sequel. Hopefully that is something he is working on.I give this book ten stars. This book literally saved my life and it can save yours.If you, a friend, or a family member are being stalked, you must read this book."
1,"Add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one. The features are great, the print quality's great, but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time (and even then only after several attempts and paper jams), you're hosed. Look elsewhere."
2,"I am 17, and all I have to say isRead this book!For Best results read the book and watch the movie."
1,"The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book."
1,"My 2 and 1/2 year old loves Bob, so he played with this for a little while. Tired of it quickly, as the magnets are not strong enough to hold blocks together to have any real pretend play. Seriously, every time he tries to open the door for Bob, the whole house falls down. The blocks are so light weight that his wooden block set is more fun to build a house with. Buy the Bob the Builder lego set and stay away from this set!"
2,"A must-have book for anyone who loves beautiful interiors. If you are an interior designer, or are looking for a gift for someone who loves to design - this is it! Stunning photographs enhance the work of the talented designers featured in this enjoyable and useful book."
1,YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
1,"TEARS of anger.tears of anger that is.i think kurt deserves more respect than this boring movie.I am hoping that in a near future, One director would have thecourage to make a film based on Tom Grant's investigation.WATCH COURTNEY AND KURT INSTEAD, DONT WASTE UR MONEY.Justice for kurt . we miss u and love u."
2,"joyful and scared by my absolute ignorance on the matter...This book is so complete, that I lost my fear, kept my joy and never needed another one!"
1,"Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on."
2,"Despite Dorian Hawkmoon's best efforts, the Dark Empire is still expanding. It is growing so much he has to take extraodinary efforts to protect his own turf. Doing so, however, doesn't solve the greater problem at hand. Heroes are made to do heroic things, and Hawkmoon is the Eternal Champion, and the Sword of the Dawn calls."
1,"Tom Brokaw knows better than his ""admiring"" comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his ""good old american image"", I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."
1,"It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either."
2,"Needed this amp to run a set of outdoor speakers. The directions were concise and clear about the few features it has, including the line 1 vs. line 2 input/override which was a complaint early on it appears. I'm running this amp with a set of relatively efficient speakers ~89db/40wrms and it has no problems providing the power to these speakers. I've yet to really crank it up but will do that once everything breaks in a little bit.Would have given 4.5 our of 5 if I could because of the popping on shutdown (I just turn the volume knob all the way down first)."
1,I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace
2,"I knew right away that America had made a mistake when they chose Ruben for the American Idol, and this cd only further proves my point.On occasion I have purchased cds and have not liked one or two tracks. This is not the case with Measure of a Man, ALL of them are AMAZING!!I recommend this cd to ANYONE who feels that Clay was cheated out of the AI title he SO deserved!!"
2,Of Mice and Men is one of those stories that resonates with you long after you finish. On one hand it's a tragedy on the other it's so beautifully written. A good one to read again every once in a while.
1,"I want to start out by stating the fact, I love Oasis. Be Here Now is a major disappointment from this sometimes brilliant band.Hype is what drove this band into the spotlight. When you have everbodys attention, you HAVE to perform well.What's The Story Morning Glory was released and it seemed anyone with a good trained ear for pure pop music was licking their chops.Then this yawn of an album was released and it seemed to take a lot of the air out of Oasis' balloon. Believe me, it's not a BAD album, it's just .....boring. Nothing jumps out at you making you want more. A lot of these songs sound like leftovers from other albums.I think that if this album actually kicked some butt, and had the catchy tunes like the ones on ""Morning Glory"" , Oasis would be #1.(not touring and sharing a bill with the Black Crows). I love you guys, you pump out some great tunes, but this is rubbish simply put."
1,"I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips."
2,"Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to ""Amnesia"" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an ""A"" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly ""Creepy Crawling"", ""Mary, Mary"" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott."
2,"Finally, the long awaited CD that all of us Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb fans have been waiting for! This CD includes Glen's best album from the 70s, ""Reunion"", along with virturally all of his covers of Webb's later songs. A must have CD!"
1,"I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont."
1,"This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?"
1,Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.
2,We had this delivered by Amazon.com to our 2 year old grandson for his birthday. His mom rated it for us based on his reaction as well as that of his 3 year old brother.
2,"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"
1,"Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case."
1,"I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine."
1,"God sitting through this was pure un-adultrated HELL. The acting couldnt have been worse if it was rehearsed and scripted. Aside from the movie sucking beyond my imagination and the villian being the most retarted thing I honestly think I Have EVER SEEN. I had humpty dumpty sitting in front of me laughing at every boring scene in this snooze fest. So needless to say humpty dumpty cut into my fallin asleep so much i wanted to just kick the fat f*** in the back of the head.Anyway...long story short dont waste your time, money, gas, or sanity on this retarted snooze fest....if you do bring something to slit your wrists with. GOD I WISH I DID"
1,"This review is for people possibly looking into the Beta Band because of their single on the High Fidelity soundtrack. Drying the Rain is a great song, but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album. It really is just a bunch of noise. Main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack. Trust Me."
2,"This is a great pitcher. Steaming milk in this pitcher is quick and easy. The bottom of the pitcher and the sides get hot when the milk is steamed, which is very helpful in determining when to turn off the steaming wand. It is well built, easy to clean, and dish washer safe. Would definitely recommend."
1,I have been using Pampers Cruisers and wanted to try Baby Dry to see how they worked. They are fine for during the day but horrible for at night. My little girl woke up cold due to her diaper didn't hold in what it should have overnight which made her onesie soaked in the morning. Will NOT buy anymore Baby Dry...Wondering if maybe I can exchange????
2,I did not get to try it on my camera because I made the mistake of ordering the wrong size but I wanted to keep it.
2,"We selected this product for my daughter because at her apt. the cable signal is still analog. There was only one Ethernet signal in the bedroom so we installed a wireless router. The Tivo needs either a phone hook up or an Internet connection. Since she didn't have a land line and no Internet connection in the living room where she wanted her TV we had to purchase a wireless UBS adapter in order to pick up the signal. Also, had a problem with the security of the router not matching the adapter but once we changed the WAP setting to WEP we were able to complete installation. Once set-up, it seems to be working well. Best of all, we had no problem getting a Tivo tech to speak with us."
1,"We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit."
1,"This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
2,The book Castle in the Attic is a good book.My favorite part is when william defeated Alastor. There was one other good part in Castle in the Attic. When William was trying to get to Alastors kingdom and the dragon was distracting him with bad visions. I recommend this book to anybody who likes exciting books.
1,"Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. I will probably play it three or four times and then dispose of it."
2,"This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!"
1,"Helen Hunt was good, but what could her character have liked about Andrew McCarthy's character? At best he was annoying. And where was the comedy? Mocking someone for nearly drowning---how is that funny?The Amanda character was rather creepy.The best part was Helen Hunt singing Buffalo Gals like Donna Reed in It's a Wonderful Life. In fact the best parts of the movie were the scenes from It's a Wonderful Life.Not a movie I would recommend."
2,"I think this album is great! It includes all of Rick's best and I love it. I do think it's terrible that his excellent vocal talents did not receive any more attention and that he just faded away in the early 90s. He's made a comeback, although it's not very big. But I still consider him to be one of the best singers of all time and this album truly shows off his talent. Check it out!"
2,"To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. If you can find the one with the booklet, even better. Watch the first part on the Livecrime DVD and the 2nd part on this DVD. The original Mindcrime with the original lineup cannot be topped. For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part. Who expects it to be?"
2,"If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history."
1,My experience with HP printers has been good. But this one disappoints me. Find a different model with better reviews. The print quality is good but the paper feed problems are frequent.
2,Excellant DVD. Had a lot of info I didn't know about the band. Highly recommended.
1,"I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew ""Fahrenheit 451"" was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Well, I hated it. I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help! Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible? There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either! I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently. I do not recommend this book!"
1,"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
1,"Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in."
1,"Mr. DuBois has a reasonable command of the English language and manages to spin a tale that, under different circumstances, might be interesting. However, the unrelenting political thrust of the novel, given life by the sensitive / tough-guy / ex-army protagonist, becomes very quickly annoying. I won't mention which way the author leans - that is unimportant - but will say that the apparent assumption by him that everyone thinks as he does leaves a bad taste in this reader's mouth."
2,"As good as expected!! The only con is that it is supposed to fit babies from 17 to 25 pounds but my baby is only 18 pounds and it's already snug. Need to change to next size, other than that very good."
2,Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. The burn thoroughly and produce great smoke for the perfect taste. Everyones loves the result.
1,"I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
1,"The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant."
1,"The plot is that Adam Sandler etting tired of dating (and etcetera-ing) different women every week gets into a permanent relationship with a woman, But through the wonder of script writing, he finds one for whom he can rewrite her memories every day. He is helped by a bumbling and goofy band of Hawaiian natives. As in all his movies Adam Sandler gets to be the hero and to mock almost everyone else (including his girlfriends brother) all in all a terrible movie. Don't waste your time."
2,"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!"
2,"This is the most fantastic book I have ever read!Jules Verne really brings the book to life! You will be taken into the world of the ocean, and youwill be lead into adventure by Captain Nemo himself!"
1,"I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."
2,This 8mm Video Recorder has one of the best pictures I have ever seen. It's better than my Beta unit and my S-VHS VCR. The sound is excellent too. This unit is also great for editing. I used to shoot all my training videos for work on 8mm and edit them at home on this machine with very little loss in picture resolution. It's just a very good machine and format.
2,"I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point. You wouldn't want to by a thirty dollar game that lasted two hours. That would [bad]!"
2,"Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished."
2,"This is the Japanese release of Pacifique, a soundtrack done for a French film. This CD contains a bonus track, ""Huahine Reggae part 2"", as well as a bonus multimedia feature. It is missing one track that's on the French release, ""La lgende part 1"" - 0:46. A must-have for Deep Forest collectors."
1,I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.
2,"I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). I am pretty much a nontoy user, but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price, I was hooked! It came on time in very discreet packaging (Thank you Lord!). A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside, completely sealed. I don't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I wasn't expecting it to be so HUGE. I took it slow, and was able to use it after a little coaxing. A little painful, but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING. Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So, it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced, but it's definitely worth it!"
1,"I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?"
2,Nicely done with good history and anecdotes. A way to find out about the workings of the man and his times.
2,"This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
1,"I'm on my 2nd pair, and it just broke like the first pair. They sound OK, and the battery life is OK, but you are paying for a fluff. They do break (usually after any warranty). I for one am not going to buy a 3rd pair, but maybe in about 2 months I'll get these back from repair."
1,I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
1,"Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison"
2,"For someone interested in the ballets before 1956 and the ballet companies who danced them, this is for you. This is what happened to the ballet world after Diaghilev's death in 1929. Out of this new world were born the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theater) and the New York City Ballet founded by George Balanchine who got his start with Diaghilev's company."
2,"I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me)."
2,"After reading Ms. Bluehorse's most recent book, Grandfather's Drum, I searched for other titles by her and found this one - The View From the Hill. While completely different from Grandfather's Drum, I feel that The View From the Hill is a mile stone in modern historical literature. Elizabeth writes so clearly, so expressively, so beautifully. She is a delight to read - even when her words are bringing tears to your eyes. Elizabeth, we need more or your books!"
2,"This is movie making like, well, like they don't make any more. Great acting, great chemistry, totally fun. Throw away the modern movies geared to 12 year olds and buy this for the sheer pleasure of watching two of the most wonderful performers ever to grace our movie screens.Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
2,"I've had the printer only a short time and haven't pushed it too hard, but it sure beats the ink jets I've previously owned. Set up was easy, it's quiet, fast and the output looks good."
1,"I bought two of these drives at the same time. The one is still going strong, but the other crashed, never to be revived, about six months from purchase. I returned it under warranty and SanDisk sent a replacement. It's not my drive fixed and, of course any information I had on the drive is gone. Okay, I could deal with that, but now that drive has also crashed and burned. There's no reviving, formatting or recovering my information....again. This time I trashed the drive; I'd kept good back-ups of all the information, I'm only out my original purchase price and postage to return it the first time. This is my last SanDisk purchase...fool me once, but not twice."
2,"This is the classic book on how television affects our children and families. Just think about how children really learn and how families should interact.Although this book was originally written closer to the dawn of television in our culture, things really haven't changed much.Ms. Winn had a great perception early on about how harmful television would be to children and their families. Check it out or better yet buy it from Amazon while you are here."
2,"The finest pop songwriters get a piece of their due with this three disc set. There were no finer writers than HDH during the second half of the twentieth century and this set is testimony to that. Sadly, most of these songs are available elsewhere and avid Motown fans will find this redundant. Great mono versions of a good chunk of their biggest hits but a second volume is called for with more of the post Motown output and a deeper look into the vaults for demos of some of the literally hundreds of top shelf songs these guys wrote. How did they do it? Don't have a clue but I sure do love these songs..."
2,"If you've played the games, then you are familiar with the story. The anime is about as good a representation as you can hope for. The story in the game is pretty complex, and the anime stays pretty true to it. There is a lot of stuff to cover and it is hard to do it in 13 episodes. We do get a little information about Shion's past, and the whole thing with Jr. and Albedo. So the animation explains the basics. I think it should have been longer though. All in all I really like this series. The animation in and voice actors are all good. The soundtrack is good too. The quality of the game is definitely not lost in this animation. Like I said before they should have made it longer, it's an unfinished piece of work. It could have an epic feel like the game did if they made another season. Even as it stands, Xenosaga is a good anime that is worth watching."
2,"Okay...So the run on sentences and the page long paragraphs get a little old and annoying...However, under all of this is a very intriguing mystery novel...Who actually killed Vinson Gowrie and how did Jake Montgomery end up in his grave? Read and find out! However, one must be patient with Faulkner for he makes you work for every element of the story you get from his books...He's also one of those authors that you just have to keep reading...Re-reading pages isn't the best idea..."
1,This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around.
2,"I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit. This unit does a better job playing everything (audio and videos) and with a larger screen and longer battery life, I was sold. I think this unit is a great option if you want to avoid ipod and itunes."
2,"""Magic"" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with ""The Bunker"" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles."
1,"I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off."
2,This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
1,"A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess. I cannot even imagine how anyone could get anything useful for his/her trading out this book. I don't have a clew why O'Neill liked this one so much."
2,"After struggling to find a gift she would enjoy that would also provide a little educational content, I'm happy that I wound up choosing the Global Puzzle. It was a good challenge for her, but not so difficult that she got frustrated or bored and gave up. I would gladly recommend this product to others with children in this age range."
1,"This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
1,"I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
1,"I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
1,"Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the book for people who didn't find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Don't even bother trying to read this."
1,This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background.
1,"I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
1,I bought this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The rubber tubs are sticky and you need to wear gloves and it leaves marks on your bikes. The red rubber protecter fell off the first time it was used. The lock that was recommedned to go with it does not fit. When the tubes are locked in place you need a hammer to get them to release. The tire holder rails will not lock in place even with a pliers. I used the product as instructed in the manual and my bike fell off in the middle of an intersection! If you use this product than you need to bungi your bike in three places to secure it! Do Not just use the hooks!
2,"No calories, no carbs, just great taste to add to coffee anywhere you are. I keep it in my purse. This stuff is great!"
2,I love it. It is thick and tight. I would buy more but it is a little too expensive. YES
2,"What can I say that has not already been said. It is a bit dark and too short, but a great effort none the less."
2,"This movie was fun and over the top. An exciting thriller worthy of purchase, but not until the price drops. The sound is terrible. I had to crank up the volume. The picture quality is fuzzy at times. Also, there are no extra features, not even a trailer. No captions. Nothing. Bare bones. Rent it only, you won't regret this watching this."
1,This is an absolutely not useful book. It is not understood at all and it is written so that no body can understand it but the author himself. So I do not recommend for you to buy it. Please save your money.TM
1,"Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH."
2,"This was one of my favorite African American films. Bill Robinson was great as usual. Lena Horne was fab-u-lous in her rendition of a broken hearted heroin, singing about her long lost love, while watching the storm at the window. And that storm scene was the icing on the cake. It was fantastic!. Cab Calloway was a treat, the way he stepped out on stage in his wide brim fedora, long watch chain smacking the floor, and that all- time stunning zoot suit; singing Geechy Joe. This film is a must see, and buy, if you are a classic cinema collector."
2,"Awaiting the new Dan Brown novel, left me in search of similar fare. Thank you Steve Berry. Sure, there are some flaws in his historical facts and characterizations, but it is still an intelligent read. There is also plenty of action for those readers who enjoy a fast-paced novel."
1,"The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
1,"I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."
2,"I loved this book! I read the first Egerton hall book, the Tower room when i was bored one day and i couldn't but then down untill i read this one. Bella is just me I love her and the ending is sooo Sweet BUY BORROW OR STEAL THIS BOOK,AND THE TOWER ROOM AND WATCHING THE ROSES AS THEY ARE MUST READ"
1,"I really liked the book, that is why I got this DVD. Big mistake. The acting is so bad, it reminds me of those cheesy after school specials where it seems like they just pulled people off the streets and said ""here's the script, do the best you can"". I have several of Mary Higgins Clark's DVDs. It is pretty much hit and miss as to whether or not the acting will be good or not. You're better off renting them."
1,"Well its winter here in New England, I want to know the temperature outdoors... and this suction cup will not stick to windows, sliding doors, nada. Within a few minutes its off and laying on the ground. Waste of money."
2,"This mini-series is a taut thriller that I recommend to anyone. It's no surprise that an American version is in the works. It is well written, the charcters are real, the choice of actors is perfect, and none of the dialogue is gratuitous. Very compelling TV."
1,"This DVD is a compilation of short excerpts from Christmas themed Veggietales videos. Some of the ""songs"" aren't even complete songs, just a portion of another video that has singing. A lot of cutting and pasting different scenes together to make a ""complete"" song. Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a ""sing-a-long"" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos. My daughter loves the traditional Veggietales videos but lost interest in this within minutes. The very end of the DVD has 3 traditional Christmas songs that simply play the music and scroll the words across the screen karaoke style with a still background. Disappointed in this product from Veggietales."
2,i gave this as a gift for my friend she love it. i like it so much that i am ordering another for me. looks beautiful well crafted.thank you so much.
2,It depends on what you are looking for but this book is just recipes for smoothies and juicing..There is some other information but it is very limited.So if you just want a juicing book you will like it but if you want more maybe not.I like it so much that I have 2 of them-one for travel and one for my house.
2,"We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas not knowing anything about it. It has become a favorite of ours ever since. We have given it as a gift on several occasions. It's easy enough for a mature 2 year old to play and fun enough for a group of 9 year olds as well. We take it on vacations and to parties, even while we waited for a table at a restaurant. It's unpredictable and changes every time you play it. Just when you think you lost, you could be the winner in the end. Each game is just the right amount of time, not too long for younger players, and not too short for the others. I highly recommend this game as a fun, fast-paced activity for your family."
2,"This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
1,The book is a reprint of a much older book. Since the original book was written there have been a number of significant advances in computing power and software and this book is very much dated.
1,"fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared."
1,"These leak about every other time my baby poops. I purchased them accidentally thinking I was getting the Swaddlers. Will NEVER buy these again, just terrible!!"
1,"Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
1,"I had an error message ""Please Check Disc"" when I attempted to play Disc 2, episodes 9-12. Everything else in Season 4 was okay.I notified the manufacturer that Silk Stalkings Season 4, Disc 2 was defective. They sent me a replacement which was Season Two, Disc 4. I notified them by email about a week ago that they sent me the wrong replacement. My email was not acknowledged.Hopefully they won't hold me accountable for their errorIf I receive the correct replacement I will rate the series 4 stars, otherwise, my 1 star rating will be it."
1,"I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. This one of many Batman toys my 6 year old son has, every 5 minutes he comes to me to put the toy back together agian. (I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away! Plus there are three pices to this toy that would fall off as soon as I put on that we didn't need anyway."
2,"It could be described as a case of ""Why did they do that?"", because although Be Here Now is a great album, it is tarnished by musical blemishes such as Don't go away and The girl in the dirty shirt. But we forgive Be Here Now of it's weaker points because of its strong ones. These strong points include D'You Know What I Mean?, My Big Mouth, and the (underrated) future classic, It's gettin' better (man!!). Maybe its me, or maybe oasis should forget about ballads and soft songs and stick to Rock 'n' roll of which they are the undisputed champions. It might be lack of inspiration or (more likely) lack of effort which contributes greatly to the more laboured efforts mentioned earlier, but overall, Oasis deserve a pat on the back for giving us some more of that unmistakibly ""Oasis"" tunes that are entirely worthy of your dosh."
2,"my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this book really helpful on what to study. the preview tests are great mind joggers."
1,"I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. This is neither instant nor is it DVD. It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy."
2,Works fine with little to no configuration or setup. On a tivo it works right out of the box.
2,"Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book."
2,"I have been learning hoopdancing little by little and this DVD has really helped me. It is meant to be watched first and then practiced on your own, which is important to know so you won't expect a follow-along DVD. (I find it best to practice hoopdancing free form with some music anyways.) The troubleshooting sections are GREAT. They help me every time I encounter a problem. It is slow going, but once I have mastered the techniques in this DVD, I fully intend to get the next one in the series."
2,"I bought these mallets as toys for my toddlers to bang on their drum set. I reduced one star because the plastic round part of the mallet may pop off and could be a choking hazard. It can easily be fixed and I really think they're okay to give the kids as long as your watching them (or your kids have matured enough to know not to put the plastic in their mouths). Given that toddlers have a knack for breaking things and/or losing things, I think these were worth buying."
2,THIS MOVIE IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE SHOW BECAUSE IT'S LOTS LONGER THAN JUST 30 MINITES. BUT I SAW ABOUT 10 SPONGEBOBS ON NICK AT NITE LAST NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE TODAY. I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL. SPONGEBOB IS MY HERO. I NAMED MY CAT GARY AFTER SPONGEBOB'S SNAIL. THE MUSIC IS ALSO GOOD. MY BROTHER GOT ME THE SOUND TRACK.
1,"This adaptor does not work with the dual USB iBook. It looks like a good product, but the plug doesn't fit."
1,"George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
2,"Really nice stand for the flute - I like the weight and how solid the legs feel. The peg is covered with velvet, so it won't scratch the instrument. The flute does, however, have some wobble as the peg is a bit smaller than the interior of the flute. (If you look at the headjoint, it can move several inches back and forth due to the extra space around the peg.) Although the wobble can be a bit unsettling, I'm still confident in the stand because of the weight/solidity of the base. Would be perfect if the peg were slightly bigger."
1,"How could anyone think that Jennifer Love Hewitt looks or acts anything like audrey? who in thier right mind could see this gangly, ungraceful, talentless, squinty has-been as one of the most beloved actresses/humanitarians of our time? Its blasphemy and I am glad this movie tanked."
1,"This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews."
2,"This product is a good value, and Pampers Baby Dry work best for my son. They don't leak, despite the fact he is a super wetter, and I love the Caterpillar Flex sides. Cute Sesame Street designs as well."
2,This story is a very good classic that sucks you right in. It has great morals and messages. A must-read.
1,"Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film.He plays Science Fiction Author David Norton. He is invited to an island conference. He takes his girl friend, asks her to marry himA DVD appears in his room and she commits suicide..and then more people start dying. He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag. There is no sub plots. The suspense of this film feels disjointed and starts to bore. There are no thrills to capture an audience. Towards the end, Hutton looks bored as lead and the film falls apartTry to miss this one in your video store, until all the other good films are rentedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,"Look, you got a dog or two? Living or traveling in southern California? Then you need this book! Seriously, to find out which beaches, parks, restaurants, hotels, etc. will accept your pooch in LA or OC, this is it. Lots of little-known dog-friendly places and tips on travel make this book worth its price."
1,"Been over a month ,still no book, it's a simple order, it's just a book. Will never buy anything from Amazon again."
2,I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape.
2,"This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection."
2,"My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds, many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed. Oh they felt okay, but didn't do the trick. When I went to my brother's house, he sat me down and I sat there the entire night! It was incredible. I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist. This chair may seem expensive, but it's worth every drop. I am waiting for mine to be delivered!"
2,"""Lola rennt"" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. I especially love it because it is none of the typical German Hollywood imitations which have flood the video market for years. Indeed I have never watched a similar film. It spreads hope and makes us realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own destiny and that we always should think before we act."
1,"They sent a similar but incorrect poster, that is only about half as cool. It was missing the NASA sign in the upper left corner as well as the Earth Solar System lettering. Instead there was the words planet Earth written in Italics and a number of fake stars added to the background. The picture of Earth was the same, but the rest of this poster just doesn't compare to what is shown here."
1,This was the worst diaper product we ever purchased. Store brands are far better than this popular product. Probably because it was on sale....Do not buy it if you care about your baby
1,The music on this CD was not what I thought it would be. It might appeal to some tastes but to me it was primitive and not pleasant for listening. I returned the CD.
1,"This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown"
2,"The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale."
2,"This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
2,Great fit. Does exactly what it is suppose to. Plan to buy more in different colors. Sent in good order.
2,So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!
2,"If you are into experimental music then check out El Guapo's ""super/system"". This is experimental indie rock that is actually listenable and fun."
2,"What can one say about protection for ones family jewels....Not only does the job that is intended but also is relatively comfortable, if that can actually be said about such things. The cup is very hard where it needs to be but as it tapers down ones body it softens up and becomes flexible so you can chase after baseballs without pulling hairs. All in all a great deal for a super price, not expecting to have to be in the market for one again, but would buy this same model again!"
1,"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."
1,"Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again."
1,"A Poor Excuse for a film.Due to the fact nothing happens in the film, example, He walks in the room, looks around the room, finds cereal, makes the cereal, eats the cereal, and we sit through a 10 minute scene and get nothing back.I am a huge fan of Asia Argento and she couldent even save this film from the trash bin."
1,"I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive"
1,"Hideous. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because 0 stars isn't an option. The very idea of remixing ""Strange Fruit"" is tastless and disturbing."
1,"Only the Clay-maniacs will like this one. It is simply horrible. I give it two stars, being generous, because I like Clay and I think he can sing. The material is bad. Did they MAKE him sing these poorly written songs? If you bought the single 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' then you bought the best of Clay, this I am sorry, is not."
2,"This book begins with a simple but excellent mathmatical review. Then covers control strategies and symbology. The book starts out very basic for the beginners and then covers more complicated control scemes. This book is great for the beginner and a good review for the experienced. Topics include: Flow, Temperature, Level, and Pressure Control Loops; Modifications to Standard PID Control; Tuning; Cascade Control; Ratio Control; Feedback and Feedforward control.All topics are covered in a straightforward, easy to understand manner. I recommend this book for the beginner."
1,"Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or ""Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."
1,"I have owned this printer 6 months. I purchased it based on price, relatively compact size and all in one capability. I have had minor problems with paper jams. The print quality in the first 5 months was good for documents, good for photos. Copy quality was good. After 6 months, I was unable to print black text. I contacted technical support. They were not knowledgeable and I spent 2 hours online removing printer cartridges, cleaning printer cartridges, aligning printer cartridges (the extent of the ""support""). I was told that the printer would be replaced with a refurbished unit and I would need to provide a credit card number to guarantee the exchange. My confidence in the ""refurbished"" unit is not very high. Luckily I have a replacement policy with CompUSA. Overall, not a reliable unit."
2,"As a dog owner, I immensely enjoyed the stories Mr. Herriot shared.Along with his skill as a vet,he shows a great heart.Anyone so caring and tender with animals is truly a decent human being."
2,"A compeling and creepy classical fiction to read. It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why. But the bottom line's that, from the first chapter until the last, you'll feel as if there's someone standing behind you, ready to hurt you. Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person."
1,every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
2,Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.
1,"As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect."
1,"When it's working, it's fun to watch it go up and down and around, but the battery is basically between the two pieces which are held together by a o-ring, no screw, no plastic ridge to pop it together, so basically it's really easy to pop apart, especially when turning it on and off involves twisting it, which many times makes it pop open. (The battery being sprung is pushing against the o-ring)anyhow, get a kid near it, and it's fragile setup basically ends up in two pieces in the water, and water in the motor, and days drying out... after a few times of this happening, the motor has started to turn slow (probably starting to rust inside).If the company could redeisgn this to get a positive locking to the pieces, this toy would be a home run, but as it's stands, it's really just a great idea stuck with a poor design."
1,"I have to agree with the other reviewers--these newer, more colorful Harold books... miss the point entirely. In this book, Harold and his crayon dont seem to have much to do with the world around him; the story is disjointed; the prose is wooden... Where's Harold's ingenuity? (ok, ONE instance of 'drawing/thinking on his feet) Where are the accidental strokes that he turns into strokes of genius?Harold and the Purple Crayon was the first book I ever checked out of the library and it was magical... and, by extension, made the library seem a magical place of infinite possibility--like my own purple crayon. The simple line drawings with just that purple crayon prove to our little ones (and us!) that imagination is the only tool you need for magic... Conversely, these slick multicolored books have no magic."
2,"The book, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it's content is truly amazing and informative. Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!"
1,Several of these diapers broke at the side seams causing the gel material to fall out and leave a trail everywhere our toddler went until we finally figured out where it was coming from. Happened with three more diapers in order and after vacuuming for over one our we gave up and tyre the rest out.
1,I thought this book was very boring. I was only fascinated with the details of the cases. I think it was poorly written.
2,"Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"
2,"My entire family has used this product since the seventies, and it is JUST AS GREAT as it originally was. You can repair shoe soles for your favorite running shoes, slippers, any rubber-soled shoes. You can put rubber on the bottoms of walking canes for stage, real life, etc. This is like rubber cement repair, only one hundred times better. Do you get the picture?"
2,"C.S. Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape."
2,"Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read."
1,"Works, but nasty click from the speakers when power on or off. What is the point of auto-on if you have to walk up to the box to turn up the volume afterwards? Company phone rings forever, so support is non existant. At least this amplifier is cheap, but of course there is a reason."
1,Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
1,"This movie was the worst movie Ive ever seen, Waste of 90 mins of time. I wish I could get paid for the time I wasted watching it.And no I ""get It""It is not art."
2,"I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction."
2,"Loved it. Great classic SF read. Spaceships, alien cultures, interplanetary criminal gangs, mysterious sciences, and my hometown of Cedar Rapids, Iowa - all the great factors that make up the perfect science fiction adventure!"
1,"As another reviewer has mentioned, Pampers has changed the design. We also hate the new design, but Amazon has the old design in stock. There's unfortunately no difference at all in the box or product labeling, so I suppose what you get is open to chance."
1,"I have finished this book with only 2.5 days.I feel very disapointed because this book mainly tell you what the features are avaliable in the Small Business Server 2000.This book hasn't tell you how to use them, how to deploy them.The style of the book is many titles in a chapter, but there is only a few words talking the title.I feel that the author is saying like ""There is Remote Access Service with SBS 2000. Then bye bye.""This book is too details for manager/decision maker, but not enough for administrator, so I don't know what this book for."
2,The Mr Coffee - 4 cup coffeemaker arrived as promised...packaged well. It is just right for one person and fits nicely on the kitchen counter. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a couple of mugs of coffee...it brews quickly and stays hot.
2,"This book is so good. Fast dialogue, adventurous, romantic and full of heroic characters. You laugh, you hold your breath you cheer. I have read this book no less than 5 times. I have now added it to my Kindle. Ransom is a story of passion and mystery, you just can't put it down.The SecretThe Bride"
2,"The power of Orwell's writing comes from the ideas expressed therein, not from the characterization or the quality of the writing. Orwell's characters in this novel are crafted of the finest cardboard, the writing is crafted of the finest of didactic lead, but the ideas therein are important -- because they are prophetic of what 2004 could be, and what 2003 may be becoming, if the current leadership of our country has its way."
2,"First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed."
1,My son's day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. He is 2 1/2 years old. He still is concerned most days as we pull in the driveway that they will show it again.
2,"It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. I would definitely recommend this filter for anyone. It is very reasonable priced considering how long each filter lasts and is very effective."
1,It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
2,It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming
1,I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
1,A good book constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. It makes you care about the characters. It stirs emotion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It makes you want to go back to it and keep reading.The Third Secret does none of these.
2,"ALthough I'm not a huge Kristofferson fan, I heard a few tracks on the local FM station and decided to give this cd a try. (Thanks to the previous reviews here also).I'm glad I spent the $$$. The cd as a whole creates a mellow mood. The lyrics aren't over wrought by the performers. I think the producer did a wonderful job of maintaining an overall feel without restricting the artists own styles.There are a few tracks I'm not fond of (very subjective) but I know that I will listen to this cd many times over the next decade. With our ability to create our own playlists for ipods etc., I don't see the point in quibbling over a few tracks. How often are there 15/18 songs on a cd that you truly enjoy?"
1,"Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster."
2,"It's intelligent, insightful, and very funny. Brilliant performances by Julie Walters and Michael Caine in a story that you wish was true. I see very little that can be improved here, and it's one of those very rare films that I'll put back on my little shelf to watch again later."
2,"Although a number of your friends may think you a bit weird if you tried to retell them. This rates as one of the few books that makes me laugh out loud (very loudly). A collection of explanations of strange & bizarre place names from around the world, Mr Adams and Mr Lloyd truly show off their incredibly imaginations and pure wit. While the reader may need a ""Monty Pythonish"" (or even a Hitch-Hikers Guide!) sense of humour, this is a genuinely very funny book"
1,"It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Big robots, smash smash smash. Whatever."
1,"This book was a required summer reading book. It seemed like it took me the entire summer to finish it. It took a very long time to get through it, and I was confused at many times during the novel. Not recommended unless you're up for a challenge."
2,"When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
1,"This book is not even worth reading, Mason Malmuth may have been a player in his day, but the game has passed him by a long time ago. This book could actually damage your poker game if you took the advice he gives. Nits no longer win in today's aggressive game and that is a fact. Mason malmuth is a dinosaur who's days are long gone."
2,"This fascinating look into the world of developing and growing economies emphasises the LCD's inverted ""u"" shaped curve of Economic growth. Although written in 1954 this work is seen as the seminal study in the field of developmental economics and was the key factor in securing W. Arthur Lewis's Knighthood in 1963, and Nobel Prize for Economics in 1979."
1,I am very computer literate. The software provided is not for use with the product. I tried to download drivers so my computer could recognize the camera but had no luck. There are other identical mini cameras like this one packaged under different names. Don't buy this one.
1,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
1,"I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped."
1,"This product is a 6inch caliper, they post 9 1/8 of the overall size of the piece, they have to specify what coustumers need to know."
1,"This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!"
1,"Wow! Can you hear it?? Listen - listen very carefully! The music here is the same as Kelly Clarkson's album, only with different lyrics and Clay singing instead of Kelly! Can I sue somebody??"
1,The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. The mask didn't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating. The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it isn't that big at all. Also the velcro that holds the cape on didn't even hold up on Halloween night. Disappointing
2,This is a great speghetti western starring Terrance Hill conquering the rowdiness of the wild west.It's a must see!!
2,"When you're truly looking forward to a CD being released, you can build your hopes up so high that you feel let down when you finally hear it. My expectations for this album were not met - they were exceeded!! Every time I think my love and respect for Clay can't possibly grow any further, that's exactly what happens. The one thing that probably stands out most about this CD is its ability to make you totally unable to choose a favorite song... they are all so INCREDIBLE! In true Clay style, he goes above and beyond ""the bar,"" putting all of his efforts into a creation that does his fans oh, so proud."
1,"This book is 3 words over and over again: MY LIFE IS BAD. 500 pages and that's all it says. It's exactly the same as any other book about a poor family with an irresponsible father and a child who manages to be alright (Angela's Ashes, Black Boy, Riding in Cars With Boys) the only difference is - THIS ONE IS FICTION. Don't waste your time, money, or your sympathy on the most over praised book ever written."
2,"Young, Fresh and Strong Talent here! From start to finish this album carries lots of energy. Tracks ""En Mis Brazos"" & ""Si Me Dejas"" are guaranteed hits. Whether you appreciate musica latina and/or enjoy good music you cannot go wrong with this album. I am anticipating these melodies to hit the clubs and car tunes soon!"
2,"Fort Apache is one of my husband's favorite movies, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. He has a very large collection of them on VHS and now he is doing the same thing on DVDs.We both love a mystery, and westerns. If there is a little romance in them to, that is a bonus. Fort Apache is a western and full of adventure and movement. And it also has romance. A very good movie.Lu"
1,I had to turn the bass all the way down and turn the treble all the way up just to find a glimpse of Clay's voice. This album just has too much clutter for a great voice like his. I guess I will just have to wait until the corporate excutives get out of the way for Clay to find his voice again. They must have thought that the music was more important than his voice.Can I get my ten bucks back?
1,"COuld of been a cool game, I love Pirates and that time in history in General, what a great oppurtunity to make a cool game but Swing and Miss. Wish it was RPG like Sid meirs Pirate is and not so linear, I eventually got stuck on one level and quit and never played it again."
1,"You can get a better quality product for what you are paying, don't get me wrong, it does what it says, but is not the best quality."
2,"This is wonderful. I wish these folks were around, young, andon the Radio and Screen today. Put this on DVD PLEASE, my VHS tape will wear out fromintroducing todays kids to these folks."
2,"OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
1,I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.
1,I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars.
1,"This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy."
1,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
1,"Ummm, he sounds good and all but some setbacks. The first song sounds good but when listening to words it sound awful. Like someone else said it sounds like he is stocking a girl. His voice warbles sometimes and just other stuff."
2,"Love it! When the boys come home and bring their friends, everyone has a bed!!! They roll up small and tight for easy storage. Also, they are very comfortable. I will even inflate one so I can enjoy sleeping by the warm fire on very cold nights."
1,"This book has about as much depth as a 30 second news story on the six o'clock news with even less fact. Obviously written to sell, not to illuminate the people it pretends to reveal. Come on, is this all that can be said about ""The Greatest Generation""? Any PBS program dealing with WWII is infinitely superior and informative."
2,"I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store - way to go Amazon!"
1,"I was so disappointed with Clay's new CD. Not with Clay himself - I have been a fan for months and will continue to be so - but with the songs. Clay's amazing voice deserves a better showcase than these hastily written, one-dimensional tracks. I had heard a rumor that one of the songs would be Clay's masterful performance of Neil Sedaka's ""Solitaire"" - but it doesn't appear on the CD. It's the best performance I've heard from him, but apparently it wasn't ""mainstream"" enough for the producers.I hope Clay will be able to shed the ""American Idol"" moniker that is following him so insidiously. He is not your average pop star, but unfortunately this is your average pop album. Clay - and all his true fans - deserve better."
2,"I love everything that has to do with Stargate. From the original Stargate movie with Kurt Russell and James Spade to the Stargate SG1 Series and Stargate Atlantis, I've been hooked for a while now. I love these shows and will always be a fan."
2,"George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the ""true"" narrative begins."
1,"This coffeemaker only brewed two pots of coffee before it stopped working. It's going back! the third 12 cup cycle took 45 minutes to brew 7 cups of coffee and boil off 5 cups water. The fourth (and last) brew cycle wouldn't pump water to the brew basket at all. When you open the water reservoir lid to see what's wrong you'll get scalded with steam rising out of the spout. It's noisy - sputtering, gurgling. One star is too high a rating for the machine we ended up with."
1,"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
2,"A Lewisian telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's sisters, drawn as a very sympathetic character. As always, Lewis writes well, with insight into the depths and heights of human psychology, and with subtle allegory and a taste for grand and weighty endings. It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth the time.Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian. It hasn't happened yet, though! Perhaps, having been brought up on the Narnia books, I've developed some immunity..."
2,The only feature missing from the Apple version of this is the light in the plug tip that confirms it is seated well and shows the charging status. I can live without it for the $70 I saved.
1,"This CD is a spectacular disappointment. Clay has a huge, pure voice, and this CD works hard to cancel it out. Overproduced and underbalanced, every song is marred by a pervasive, tinny whitenoise, as if the drummer was told to keep the cymbals hissing through every song. This fuzzes up Clay's pure, clear tone, and cancels out every nuance of his emotional and musical resonance. It's as if the producer/arrangers didn't trust his voice to carry. What idiots. Clay seems like a smart kid; hopefully he's smart enough to choose another producer for his next CD."
1,"Here is the timeline of this product:After first two plays, little wood pieces started chipping off;In about two weeks, the pictures started peeling off;In about one month, layered wood started falling apart.Will I still buy puzzle from this company? Maybe, no one else selling small puzzle set for toddlers. What choice do I have? But I do pray to God that somebody will be making a better product soon and drive Melissa & Doug out of business."
2,It bothers me a lot to see that almost everybody has been praising Usher as the R&B king. Hell no! Brian McKnight is the real deal. Usher is just a R&B beginner.
2,"I read this book back in high school, thinking ""Well, it's a classic. One of those books I SHOULD read."" I was right. There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read. There's constant references to this in media, pop culture, etc. It's just an important piece of literature. I think every single person who cares about their own intelligence should read this book. You just HAVE TO! Nuff said."
1,Disk#1 - too few wordsDisk#2 - starts with based on reading; but there are no lessons on how to readetc
2,"I am partial to the Familia Swiss brand for my museli, but this is my favorite crunchy style. I prefer to have the nuts in the mix and add my own fruit as seasonally available. Freeze dried fruit is just never as good."
1,"These diapers do not work at all! We had been using Pampers Swaddlers and they are great. Unfortunately, I saw that I could buy these for a few dollars cheaper and decided to try them out. They do not work. We have been using them for about a week and EVERY time my son has a poopy diaper, it's a complete blow out. Even when he is upright, it somehow leaks out the top of the back of the diaper. We had been using the Swaddlers and only had one blow out in 4 months. Maybe these diapers work with older children with firmer stools, but they do not work at all for us at this age. Besides the constant blow outs, these diapers have a plastic, cheap feeling. Pampers should be ashamed to put their name on them. So, instead of saving a few dollars, I'm now buying new diapers even when I have around 200 of these diapers left."
1,"Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books"
2,I bought this because I wanted to extend my in-home sound system to my deck. I used a pair of OSD AP-650 weatherproof speakers and I am very happy with the sound quality. The 50 watts per channel is just what I needed to get me good sound without blowing my neighbors off their decks. It all sounds great at low and full volume. Even my wife likes it.
1,"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."
2,The new SWEATSUIT album is hot. My favorite song is Tired featuring Avery Storm. I can really relate to this song. Sometime you get too feed up and you can't take it anymore. That's when its time to go. My man Nelly really did it this time. I have to give him mad props. I LOVE this man. I cannot wait for more to come. Keep up the good work Nelly.
1,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
2,I am a girl that reads Hot Rod Magazine lol love the covers & the cars would be nice if the mag was thick instead of thin or skinny
2,"My wife and I bought this rice cooker a little over a month ago, and we've used it at least twice a week since. It has performed flawlessly every time, with all sorts of rice. Cleanup is very easy with the non-stick bowl, and the programmable timer means that we can start dinner before we leave for work in the morning.We're both very happy with what we call ""the Neuro Fuzzy"", and would whole-heartedly recommend it."
1,"If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,"I'll never buy a HP product again - sitting here with a Laserjet 1020 I'll never be able to use again after upgrading to Vista. Tried all fixes and workarounds, no luck.HP LaserJet 1020 Printer (Q5911A#ABA)"
2,"I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."
1,"This stands out in my mind as one of the biggest wastes of time I ever spent watching a movie. The name of the movie is Rosemary's Baby, the whole movie centers around awaiting the birth of the baby, and after all is said and done, we spend a lot of time being bored and not seeing the baby. Total rip-off. Save your time and money. This movie is complete garbage, regardless of the decent acting."
2,Pampers are really good for baby's skins they are soft and smooth. Pampers Sensitive are better than Baby Dry but they are more expensive.
2,"These boots are very well made. my husband wears them for work and he loves them. They hold up well even with every day wear, got a year+ out of the last pair. he also says they are very comfortable."
2,"I love this CD! I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. Touch and Invisible are my most favorites! Anyone interested in listening to a golden voice, try out Clay! Judge for yourself. Everyone has their own favorites, and Clay outdid himself here for me. When You Say You Love Me is great as well with even a country feel to it. I have never had an album before where I liked ALL the songs like this one. Awesome debut I want more."
1,Amazon sent wrong cable to me twice... the picture and description clearly show a six inch cable. Original order and replacement were wrong.
1,"Bill Engvall hosts this show and says he might be out of a job now that these guys are around. Your job is very, very safe Bill. Aside from Reno Collier, the last comic on this DVD there is not a lot of good comedy here. In a few years, most of these guys will still be the middle act in a club somewhere."
1,"Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous."
2,"It's all good. This album suffers from a common problem among metal albums in that almost all the songs sound very similar, but in this case it just doesn't matter because it's all enjoyable. From the haunting vocals to the masterful pacing of the instrumentals, every song on here is actually fairly inspiring to listen to, clich as those descriptions sound. Definitely worth a buy."
2,"This is a timeless book that seems more true with each passing year. Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no ""memory hole"" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny."
2,"I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
1,"This old book (written in the 1950s) is published by a labor union because mainstream publishers would not touch it. Union people love this book because it makes union leaders out to be martyrs and saviors of the world, standing up to those mean, greedy old corporate capitalists. For these authors, the story of labor is black and white, no shades of gray. Labor can do no wrong and never has done any wrong. The Molly Maguires were not draft dodgers and murderers, but innocent martyrs who got framed. The Homestead rioters were poor oppressed immigrants asserting their right to take control of steel mills, and are not not to be blamed for beating and shooting the police or trying to assassinate the company president. The western miners headed by Communist Big Bill Haywood didn't really blow up mines with dynamite, the mine owners did it just so they could blame the union. This book isn't history, it's a cartoon of history. Don't look for any balance, objectivity or nuance here."
2,"HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn't say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says... Multiregion."
2,"Gelfand and his acolytes make solid and original jazz out of music usually associated with children. These arrangements are simply delightful, my favorite being ""Passe-Partout"" a theme I knew by heart as a 4-year-old in '78. Gelfand not only arranges the themes well, his interpretations and solos on the piano shows that they could have a great new life as jazz!"
1,"I like Crispin Glover and i am a huge horror and genre fan, but this movie was weak, really weak. I like movies sometimes that are bad, because they are bad in a way that is funny or even enjoyable. This was a movie that was bad and after it was over I say ""I just wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was) of my life on this crap!"""
2,"in addition to providing many details about Dali's life, his relationship with Breton and the surrealists, his friendship with Picasso and so on, the book provides the reader with an excellent discussion/analysis/explanation of Dali's artistic/aesthetic choices and of his 'paranoiac-critical method'.This seems to be the definitive book on Dli's paintings."
1,"I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."
2,"This product is the best. I have been on it for 3 years. It takes six weeks to notice a difference.,and. 6 months to see a difference. The key to lose fat is toning; this product does helps with that! As we age our body needs protien to supply energy, and balance our homones. I take this product during the day and one packet at night. I am 42 years old : My results are a flat tone stomach., younger skin., and consistant weight of 125. I also take nutracutics vitamins. Email me if you have questions."
2,Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1This was a free taste of a 5 book series. I love to try these books to get my feet wet. I was not disappointed.I just finished a year long Old Testament Bible study. I really enjoyed the stories of the Kings. Lynn Austin has done her homework.The language of the book reminds you that it is a Bible story but it flows in a way we moderns can better appreciate. I plan to get the rest of the series and let the rest of my fellow students know about these books.
1,This item arrived broken. I had it shipped for Christmas but it was defective and now I have to pay $2.50 more if I want to return it. Hardly worth my trouble.
2,Lightfoot favorite that was good to hear again! He is at his prime on this album both as a singer and songwriter.
2,"Here's another charming fable by Robert Nathan - your typical dog (Musket) meets dog (Susan) story: confirmed bachelor Musket gets swept off his feet by newcomer cutie in town Susan, they have a falling out (he thinks she's a flirt and untruthful, she thinks he's conceited), and then there's a reconciliation and all's well that end's well. Although animals are the main characters in the novel, they display all the foibles in human nature. It's a cute story and certainly not the first nor last about a sexy female who gets the best of a stuck-on-himself male. There is a corresponding plot line concerning a young woman and a woodcutter who's in love with her, but it's not nearly as fun or interesting as the lightly satirical doings of the various animals acting out their version of the ""human comedy."" Delightful."
1,"Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :["
1,This was written very poorly and it is not worth your time to buy or read.I wasted 6 days to get this book and then spent 5 minutes reading the book then it took no more than one minute to decide to return the book to get a refund.This story is a complete waste of time!
1,"I ordered this Standing Horse, expecting to get what is pictured. Instead, I got a rearing horse, which has the two front legs in the air. I am still trying to resolve this with Amazon. The quality is fine otherwise - a small, crudely carved, lightweight wooden (balsa wood?) horse."
2,"Apart from the crappy instructions and lack of supplied USB cable, this is fantastic printer. VERY quiet and efficient. Some have mentioned the paper curl problem. I found that using proper laser paper greatly reduces curl. And some brands (Domtar, for example) are better than others so experiment. Improved text as well."
1,She's right in the middle of the pack of all the prepubescent sounding talentless young female singers that the recording industry is foisting on us. I was on the verge of canceling Time Warner cable when they discontinued her commercial. I hope this is the last we hear of her.
1,"I am little disappointed about this is. This is the exact same movie as ""Lassie"" I bought in November - just different cover.I love the movie but I am disappointed about the ""misleading marketing trick"". That's why I only gave it a 2 stars."
1,"This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid."
2,"I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. I am so glad I purchased this video. The price is very good for the information received.Updated 30 Nov 10 :This video was a life saver. The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery. Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative."
2,"In 2081, a new kind of telescope, using subtle quantum effects, allows for a detailed examination of all the planets of the galaxy and abroad. Life is present everywhere, but not civilization. Subtle evidences show that civilizations are numerous, but that they disappeared... Where? What is our own enthralling future?This book is anticipation in the Jules Vernes style: bold but realistic prospects with nowaday 2000' science, some scientific popularization, without forgetting warm-hearted characters in an optimistic vision of life.Richard Trigaux, author."
2,I purchased the Economy Pack of Pampers because it was such a great deal. Diapers are essential for babies and can become a big expense for parents. I was able to send several months of diapers to these first time parents. They have been much appreciated.
2,Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate.
1,"The X6 modem, when it works, is a great little modem that does everything that I need. But it will work for a period of time, and then disconnect itself from the internet. I've flashed it to the latest version of firmware, but the problem is still there.So if you are shopping for an ADSL modem, I would suggest that you to keep on looking."
1,"Yeah if you are between 14-16 you should love this crap cause thats what exactly it is. They call themselves Nashville Pussy but they really should call themselves White Trash cause they are not much more then that. There is nothing complex here its just the way you would expect something when you were, well 14. Loud, no real meaning,and they are not really all that fun either so i dont get it, it looks like because they mention Sex that means they are good? Wrong, they suck bigtime and there is no talent here and they are not saying anything here that hasn't been already said many many times, save your money"
1,"If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down."
2,"This disc proves that there's much more to the Campbell/Webb association than the 4 or 5 hits from the late 60s we all know and love. 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress', 'Highwayman', 'Lightning in a Bottle' and 'If These Walls Could Speak' are particularly fine Webb songs and they're given superb renditions by Campbell. The chemistry has always been right between these two and I hope it's not the last we hear of them together."
1,"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."
2,"Don't let inexperienced listeners fool you: The different versions on this CD are indeed very different. ESPECIALLY 'Olsen', which is in a completely different (and more delicious-sounding) key than the version on ""Music Has the Right..."" This is a wonderful CD single, and has my favorite BoC track so far: Happy Cycling. This song alone is worth the price. Can't wait for their next release!"
2,"Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!"
1,"This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others."
1,"Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness."
2,"When I first read this book, I felt that the characters were too strange and the plot(s) unbelievable. But after I had finished it, I kept thinking about the book and the characters -- it was as if they wouldn't leave my mind! I eventually bought a copy and I have since re-read it several times. If you like offbeat fiction and unusual characters, you'll love this. I found the romance of Kitty and Rambeau to be the most ""real"" part of the book, and very touching."
2,"If you are tired of those lame, ineffective horror movies that have been advertised to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you to death, take a look at ""The Descent"" for a fresh new look on this view.This movie WILL terrify you beyond all belief. You will find yourself just as scared as the victims in this movie. You will be clenching onto the nearest item in anticipation for what is going to happen next. Because, trust me, you really have no idea what will happen next.I found myself practically leaping out of my seat in terror. And, trust me everyone, that RARELY happens. I go through most movies with a whatever attitude and don't show any fear. I make it through movies like The Exorcist without breaking a sweat. However, this movie had me wondering what was going to happen and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time.Once again, IF you want that horror film that will not let you down in the slightest bit, pick up ""The Descent"" today."
2,"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and Zelazny remains one of my favourite authors. His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found ""Eye of Cat"" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in ""Lord of Light"". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s. This novel has a permanent place on my bookshelf."
1,I'm not sure what zombie movies the other reviewers have watched but I find it hard to believe they actually liked this one. I feel like I was tricked into paying for this based on the reviews. The acting sucks. The set design sucks. The effects suck. What I'm trying to say is that this movie sucks.
1,"From a woman who sold out her body ages ago and now attempts to be a partisan hack, and poorly at that. Why anyone would want to wipe their feet on this dirty carpet is beyond me. Not worth the time it took to phone in sex."
2,"I actually found Satan's Wife (USA) (DVD title) (1979) film quite entertaining by distracting my attention from what burdens or distresses me (Old Latin, seafood, pending legislative activity and George Walker Bush). Had anyone other than John Phillip Law (Danger: Diabolik! ) played the role of the Exorcist, I think this film would have collapsed.The plot has more than its share of weaknesses, which is common among films involving Italian Exorcist rip-offs (especially those containing Satanists, occultism and Female nude scenes) --seriously, just go back to the day before it all occurs and deprive Satan of power!) and it dragged on a bit towards the end, which I found very unsatisfying. It's still worth a look if you're in a demonic possession mood but it's more Italian devil scandal than Exorcist.Maybe in the 70's it was a good Exorcist-copy film but not now, now it's just late '70's shoddy devil madness."
2,Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports. The use of the Spouse House Firm throughout the book allows you to see the develop of financial reports as they apply to a small growing firm. Robert writes as he is right in front of you talking to someone he has known for a long time. He uses humor to help you understand the difficult concepts of the book. If you are looking to learn financial statements or just refresh your skills this is the book I recommend.
2,"This is the CD that solidified DM's status as one of my favorite bands. It's gloomy, to be sure, but at least it's consistently gloomy. And it's amazing how well ""Strangelove"" and ""Never Let Me Down Again"" have held up over the years."
2,This book is extremely useful for Java Architects that need to design scalable web applications. The author did a very good job describing all the proper design patterns that should be used in the presentation tier. This book appears to focus on the most important architectural issues in web development such as integrating the presentation tier with the business tier. I was also impressed with the author's ability to clearly defined how the new generation of struts design patterns should be used when building scalable web applications.
2,"I love this album. It's catchy, it rocks, the lyrics can be oddly abstract or perfectly plain. Matthew, Mona, and Steve make great music that will stick in your head for days, but in a good way. This is the CD you'll want to drive to. This is the CD you'll tell your friends about again and again until they resent you for it. This is the CD that will make you want to start a band. As Matthew himself would say, ""My pain is your gain!"" Don't miss out. You won't be sorry."
1,"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+."
1,Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
1,The book we received was a photocopy of the original. It was a black and white copy and totally useless. We are sending it back.
2,"This book is awesome. Brings back feelings of hope, love, and adventure. Great days of story telling that are long forgotten."
2,I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Shouldnt they be by now? I would buy all of them and be proud to add them to my movie collection.
1,"This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf."
1,"I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."
2,"Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
1,"I never recd my merchandise , true enough no fault of this seller, it was my post office, but I nevertheless I don't have it!!I still like this seller and might purchase from them again in the future!"
1,"Hello All,If you were ever planning to get a Tivo remember one thing. The customer service stinks! It is easier to have a root canal than dealing with their customer service department. Once turn on you will have to cancel your credit card to have them stop charging it.Don't get me wrong I love the service but don't expect any help from their customer service department, plus get one of those ""Prepaid"" credit card to pay for the service, because if you use a real one they wont stop charging it."
1,"ICP has just gone down hill. The last three or four cd's I purchased just plain sucked to the point they are now sitting on a rack in the local cd trader store...don't do it people, you know you know better"
1,"It's true that there are many different motifs in the book but the drawings are very approximate, without even respecting the symmetry and the geometry of the objects."
1,This Bluetooth does not work that well. It seems to understand my commands only part of the time. I will opt to buy a more expensive one with noise reduction too.
2,"Overall, I liked this book. I am doing my 11th grade AP English-3 research paper on it. Overall, this book made me think. It made me think about how people of the WW 2 time period thought: that there might be another war. This book was an example of only one man's thoughts. It would be interesting to see what other people of this time period have to say about Fahrenheit 451."
1,"I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead!"
2,I saw this move in the 70's and have always loved this movie.Truly a must see classic film for the whole family.
1,"when Clay Aiken is freed from his American Idol contract and gets to do some real music.The only cool songs on this album are This is the Night, No More Sad Songs, and I Will Carry You. For the most part though, this album is a mixture of bubblegum pop and Broadway - ...which should never be mixed because everyone knows Clay Aiken dosn't want to be a pop star/teen idol. I don't believe his real fans want him to be one either."
2,"I don't know why this album is regarded as one of Oasis's lesser albums. In my opinion it is their best album, and tends to be the album in which I still listen to the most. It is probably Oasis's hardest most heavy album with songs like ""My Big Mouth"", ""I hope, I think, I Know"", ""it's gettin better man"", and ""D'you Know what I mean"". Th album has more of a rock feel than a pop feel than ""What's the Story Mourning Glory"". I feel that every song on this CD are great rock songs. Give it a listen because it is the best album Oasis has put out."
1,"I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
2,"I picked this out of the bargain bin at Amoeba Records, in San Francisco. For a buck, I thought, hey, why not? I can still afford a couple of Crimson and Sabbath discs. Turned out that this record became one of my favorite listens. I can't even start to describe the genre, I just go with what I like. The ingredients include: One heartbroken girl, singing hearttugging songs, a guitar with enough fuzz to sand wood, steel-corded bass(very little thump, presumably to let the notes go through,) lilting sustain-driven keys, and snappy drum sounds. To try to embellish any more aspects of their sound technically would be foolish. I will say this, however. Their interpretation of the ""The little drummer boy"" is one-of-a-kind. Ah rum pumpum pum... rum pumpum pum...."
1,"Took it out of the box. Read instructions. Added rice and water. Plugged it in. Greeted with a ""U01"" staring at me from the display.Manual says ""breakdown"" Called customer service. Authorized dealers listed on a separate card. No dealers for Nevada (and many other states). Instructions say unit must be packaged (certain way) and postage paid befor sending it in for repair.I'll use my $10 pan for future rice cooks, and toss this $200 piece of junk in the trash bin. For this kind of price, they should drive to my home in a limo. I was very stupid to spend that kind of money on this rice cooker...don't you be."
2,"Welllll, what I can say..this movie is ""DIFFERENT""..GOOD, but DIFFERENT. If you are a TRUE Kurt Cobain/Nirvana fan, you'll learn to appreciate it. It hurts to see this is what Kurt might have gone through! (I HOPE NOT), but the movie itself is very ""QUIET"". He doenst say much. The ""song"" scene"" is the emotional part, Pitt definately played a good role!..I recommend YOU WATCH it..only if you're a TRUE FAN, otherwise, dont waste your time, you wont find it interesting."
1,"I thought these would be great for my wee one, I have been using swaddlers and loved them. After just a short time everything was wet and damp eww gross gross gross gross. So I will use what I have left and move on to another style and if they don't work too well i will move on to another brand."
2,Spoiler Alert!They found a dead girl in the beginning of the movie. Couple of the people involved were being interviewed in the middle of the movie. They found out who the dead girl was at the end of the movie.That is basically about it. This is very simple. There are alot of sexual contents and naked women in this movie from start to finish. Even old grandma is full frontal naked from top to bottom!! make sure you cover your eyes if you don't want no nightmare. The pace is kinda slow but yet still engaging.Not a bad movie. 4 stars.
2,"this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included."
1,"I've owned a pair of QC2's for about a year now, and after about 6 months they started making an annoying squeaking noise if I wore them while walking. Then this morning, I went to put them on my head, and the headband cracked, making them pretty much useless.I've had $50 headphones built much more solidly than these."
1,"Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
2,The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise.
1,"Bought this to take two bikes on a road-trip. Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly."
2,The only downside to this adapter vs. apple's is the lack of the light ring which tells you whether the computer is fully charged or not. Otherwise it's a great deal!
1,"I have been out of medicine for 5 years and am reviewing to re-enter practice. I am only on question #145 but have come across 6-10 errors- mainly things that are contradicting previous answers. Many times I am double-checking answers on up to date.Otherwise, I guess the material is fine, but really for me personally, it is intolerable to have so many errors. Studying should NOT induce extra anxiety!!I have stopped using this book and just ordered Swanson's 6th edition and one other resource as well."
1,"Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
2,"This is a classic for sure but a classic of what? Most of the people Harrington writes about have created their own worlds and then populated them. Yes, we do feel sorry for the underprivileged but most people in America have the privilege of a free education, free libraries and free charity. If they fail, whose fault is it?"
1,"Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game..."
1,"Tried to repair shoes that were pulling away from the soles...directions said to apply lots of glue, so I did. Once it dried, it made the shoes very heavy...so much so that I don't like to wear them anymore. It did seem to hold the soles back together pretty well, but again, made the shoes very heavy."
2,"If you are looking for a fast read that is not ""fluff,"" but intellectual and well-written, then pick up a copy of In the Heart of the Sea. I bought the book based upon its topic and the fact that it had won the Book Award, not based upon any interest in the history of whaling or Nantucket. But I left the book feeling that I had ventured into a little part of the past that I would still care to know more about. It's also a great book to read along with Shackelton's story in the book entitlted South. The two books showcase vastly differing outcomes that resulted from decisions made in the face of tragedy at sea."
2,"I remember to this day receiving this from one of my favorite teachers in the 6th grade (Mrs.Diaz) as a gift. Now, a Sophomore in College, A tree grows in Brooklyn is still my favorite book ever. A really warm story, its so real you can feel it. Really touches the heart."
1,"I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy. Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars. There have to be better versions out there, though."
1,"Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!"
2,"Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!"
2,This product is awesome. Children as well as adult children can safely play with product and not damage it at all. If you have a very playful child (or adult) this is the best toy to have.
1,"I only made it 15 minutes into this movie before I turned it off. My only question (and this pertains to plot, action sequences, dialogue, etc.) is WHY?"
2,"A tried and true essay of many years. Not the sort of book you can read during the TV commercials, but well worth the effort."
1,"The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The ""Third Secret"" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations."
1,I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page.
1,"I bought this because my wife had surgery and needed something to use in the shower to reach parts she couldn't bend to get to. The brush cannot handle water very well. It started to get funky and peel and became useless within a month. I guess if one completely dries it off after every use and hangs it in the open air to continue drying, it might last longer and be useful. If you hang it in your shower, though, it turns into some germ ridden piece of junk in no time."
2,"I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a ""darkened environment."" Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use. Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them. Batteries are not replaceable (unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes). Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery's decay."
1,"This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."
2,I have to say..I am so enjoying my Tivo service thanks to the uSB wireless adapter. Without it I would not be able to watch or have Tivo service
2,"Wow, where to begin? I bought this cd in 1992 after one of my city's alternative rock stations started giving significant airplay to ""We Are Each Other"" and ""36-D."" Never could I have imagined how 90% of the songs on this album are outstanding! From the sad stories of ""Old Red Eyes"" and ""The Rocking Chair,"" to the upbeat ""We Are Each Other,"" ""The Domino Man,"" and ""I'm Your #1 Fan,"" and to the spooky, somewhat bizarre stories told in ""Here It Is Again,"" and ""Something That You Said."" It's a shame this recording didn't get the same kind of airplay in the states as it did in England, where they are a smash. This cd had been given to friends around the country, from Ohio to Florida and Texas, and everyone has loved it! Enjoy"
1,This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.
1,"This book promised to be rich in the recently discovered secrets of the prophet Isaiah, a scientific explanation of prayer, and ""A Groundbreaking Interpretation of Prayer, Quantum Science, and Prophecy."" Not!If you break ground with this book do your self a favor - throw it in the hole and cover it up it's not worth the read.If you want to read about someone else's personal adventures and their preceived importance then this book is for you!"
2,"My favorite diapers were the sensitive skin swaddler diapers, these were my next favorite and I think that overall they were better than the cruisers. For some reason there would be the crystals that appeared after my daughter would urinate and I honestly didn't like this. So if you don't like the swaddlers you should give these a try."
2,"Stacie Orrico is the best. Honestly, I downloaded all of her songs on Napster and I loved it. I loved the cd so much, I decided to buy the cd and support her so She will bring out new albums. Family Christian review says She is Destiney's Child with a Christian theme. I personally think along the lines of Aguilera with a Christian Theme. I am always glad to see young teen artist take a stand for Christ. Some of my favorite songs of hers are Don't Look at me, Stay True, and Dear Friend. I find myself putting their songs on repeat alot. If you want peak at her cd, goto http://www.launch.com/music/artistpage/1,4391,1048259,00.html(vocals included) or http://www.stacieorrico.com/ (just music, no vocals). And Rememeber, If your looking for perfection, don't look at (wo)men, Look at Him."
1,The streaming was so poor I eventually gave up and searched for the movie on my Verizon FIOS where I watched the last 30 minutes on TNT (with commercials) where it was also playing.
1,"I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware."
2,"Great movie series, fun to watch hope it continues with more sequels. This one was as good as the first ones."
2,"I am very interested in the earliest days of our great country, but I found William Bradford's accounts tedious to read -- of course this is in part due to the way people wrote back then"
2,"Yes, this book is brain candy. Potato chips for the mind. So what? Not every book has to be freakin' ""War and Peace"". Mr. Ringo gives us the ultimate adolescent fantasy -- a super-warrior with a harem, his own band of warriors, all the weapons & gadgets he wants, Presidential support, his own brewery, and millions of dollars. (Having read what I just wrote, I feel a strong urge to shout, ""Dude! Chicks and money and guns! And beer!Awesome!"" I'll try to restrain myself. Heh.)While the sex scenes are a bit overdone, the novel itself is quite enjoyable. I read it while stuck in an 8-hour plane ride; and I must say it was very entertaining. If you want a fast-paced, action-filled story that'll keep your interest, this book is for you."
1,"there is no enterence video,no storylines,much lesser wrestlers so its not enjoyable playing mode, so please next time just think about this things so it can be enjoyable while playing on GBA."
1,Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
2,"I got these diapers for my son, he has used them before and did great with them. I got a great deal on them!"
2,Always a pleasure to listen to Michael Ball perform . Great selection of songs from the stage and performed wonderfully.
2,"I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. I would call it an Art of Chinese Medical science."
1,I never received this item. The seller sent this item to my shipping address at my billing address. 2 different addresses as we do not receive mail at our house.
1,"In a complaint to Macally regarding intermittent charging, their response was:Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4Thank you for contacting us.Our PS-AC4 has problem with the 12"" PowerBook G4. At this moment, we do not have any working one for your computer."
2,"This cd was awesome, i love clay...everything he does it just amazes me more and more. I would have loved to see more of the range that he possesses but its all good. I love you clay, keep on going strong!!!"
2,Just Wonderful!!! My wife Loves IT! No more overcooked or burned rice...and no more pots of water boiling over and messing up stove...Rice Cooker Heaven....
1,"Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie."
1,"Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
2,"I got this for christmas it was great! The only downside is that it makes its own ""comments"" and you cant play music without that thing shuting up. Other wise it was great. I think its great that its one of the very few toys that boys and girls like. (Only recomended for ages 8-12 and dont buy this unless u have some sort of ipod!)"
2,"My favorite book of classic literature, Tess had me crying and begging for more. Hardy unfolds this tale with true genius. Filled with love, hate, depression, and happiness, Hardy does an incredible job of displaying human emotion. I heartily recommend it without second thoughts"
2,"Have used the printer many times with satisfaction every time, Am finding trouble getting refill paper and cartridges from Sony and other dealers. A terrific product and the color prints are outstanding. Very reliable. Highly recommended"
2,"Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person. Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject."
1,"I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it."
1,"For those of you who are considering buying this game on gameboy advance, I recommend you change your mind. The graphics are great, but several times when I was playing it, my character would freeze up or get stuck in a corner, and I had to restart the whole game. And in the Mines of Moria, when you finally find the exit, the character freezes and won't move past a certain point. It may work on other consoles, but I'm not sure because I haven't tried it yet."
1,"i'll make my review short on this movie. it took 59 minutes to get to the ""good stuff"" and there wasn't much at that. you've seen all this before. no shock value here."
1,"I have been very unhappy with this product because it:1) makes a high pitched buzz2) intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power.3) the cord is difficult to wrapI'll be trying to return it through the warranty process, but I wish I had just coughed up the [lots of] extra money to buy an Apple one."
2,"I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(...). Like many of the reviews have already mentioned, this game is excellent! Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete."
2,"I have been buying favorite old classics to refresh my memory. The results have been variable. Parkinson's Law stood out as one that had amazingly held up. Huff comes close. His slim book nicely exposes many of the all too persistent tricks used to misuse data. He provides a good catalog of the obvious, but still employed devices to mislead. In this political season, we can all benefit from recalling these ancient tendencies. As far as I could tell, good alternatives are scarce."
2,"This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I have seen them all.Batman makes Spiderman look like a total loser.This and Batman (1989) are the only movies of batman worth seeing. The Joel Schumacher renditions are utter CRAP!As Christian Bale said when getting an award for his role in Batman Begins ""It is great that Chris [Nolan] has finally brounght back some DIGNITY to the greatest superhero of all time..."" That is a semi-quotation of what he said, you get the idea.This movies is totally amazing, I can't wait to see ""The dark Knight"", whcih began filming this month (March), and will be out next year.I have no doubt it will be amazing, just as this film is.BUY IT!"
1,This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
2,"Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229. These are the style of questions all Microsoft exams should contain to maintain the credibility of their certifications.This review is a good heads up on how Microsoft is changing their exams to cover hands on work experience versus fact regurgitation. Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit."
2,"I loved reading Dale Carnegie's books since I picked up How to Win Friends and Influence People. His writing style is very easy to read and he is always giving examples to make the content as clear as possible. That being said, The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking is a great book. I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first. However, if you are specifically looking for a book on Public Speaking, Dale Carnegie is a great author and he has several books about this topic. This one is great and I recommend it."
1,The Neopets collection is not as good as it seems. You could only play a few games and you cannot do as many things on it compared to the neopets website. this toy is not educational because it doesnt teach you anything and it isnt fun to play with. You play with it only a few days and then you get tired of playing with it that you just leave it hanging around. I dont recommend this toy for anybody.
1,"Curly, perhaps the most popular and most imatated stooge is on the cover, on the back and in all the pictures that come with this slick looking boxed set.But he is in only one of the three short films. (Also, there are hardly any short films that come with this. The other filler is cartoons, a movie without Curly and interviews and other junk.)This is not a good collection for fans of Curly. It is however good at misleading the 3 Stooges fan into thinking that he or she has found a gold mine of 3 Stooges material at a great price. Sadly, that is not to be.Instead of wasting your time and money on this blatent rip-off, you would be better off at building your 3 Stooges library on other collections that don't contain the words ""75th Anniversary Collection."""
2,Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details. But I guess that makes for a good book writer.
1,"This case offers very little protection, and most of the phone is exposed. Not worth it..."
1,This stuff tates horrible smells horrible and does not work. My daughter has actually had less milk production since shes started using it. After weeks of hopeing it would start working she has completely quit using it and has thrown it away. I would not recommend this product to anyone.The company who shipped to me were great!!!! I received the product way before i expected I would.
2,"I use this phone holder every day on my commute, in conjunction with an auto charger and hands-free earset. I find it indispensable in securely fastening the phone in place, yet easily removable. It makes one-hand dialing easy, and I don't have to worry about the phone sliding around because of sudden turns or stops. One word of note: it doesn't accept the use of oversize extended-life batteries."
1,"The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
1,"I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now. I havenever had a problem. I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair....great for summer. The third time I wore one pair,I got a hole in them. I am not even sure how that happened. I figuredI must have done something. I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them...the same leg (right one). Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again."
1,"...I bought this card thinking I could install it in my FujiFilm FinePix S2Pro and have no problems, but I got errors that could not be cleared by in-camera or Windows formatting of the media.I have never had a problem with CompactFlash before, and of the half dozen manufacturers I have, including Lexar, Sandisk, Nikon-branded, Fuji-branded and some Brand-x I picked up at Frys, all of them work in my S2Pro, whereas only one of the SimpleTech cards will.Better safe than sorry!"
2,"A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
1,"I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas. This is the strangest thing. A polka after Brotzmann is enough to jar you for a long time.I returned mine for a refund."
1,"There is no close caption to the movie, and it is very boring, due to not understanding what is going on without close caption. Remeber there are 21 million deaf and/or hard of hearing people in U.S.A. that depends on close caption. If ypu cut our close caption off, then the rating falls way down."
1,"Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this."
2,"I love every song on this CD. Clay has proven himself to be be a powerhouse. What a voice and the way he sings Perfect Day absolutely hitting all those high notes. As for Broadway, Broadway couldn't handle what he would bring to the stage. His voice is so pure, so rich and I get chills with each song he gives us."
1,"I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats, but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."
1,Flat Keanu Reeves vanity project that lacks a lot brain and allot of showmanship with a story that makes no sense and a leading man who can't act the role he's playing. Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are about the only actors in the film who give great performances and that's really because they are over qualified to be in a movie of this type. Weisz gives too much heart and soul to her role and Stormare gives a sadistic edge that is way too fierce to be in a movie like this. Both of them are head and shoulders over Keanu Reeves in the acting department and both of them literally blow him out of this film.See it for their performances only because it's the only good you are going to get out of this bad movie.
2,I found this book a bit hard to read at times due to the period in which it was written. I learned some very interesting things about Mr. Franklin and now respect him even more. The dedication and conviction with which he set about his life were inspiring.
2,This is a fabu book...all young women can learn from this book...this is the man NOT to marry...
2,"Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past."
1,"You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient."
1,"If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants."
1,This is the very cheap product that does not measure up to the standards of the other Pampers diapers. I would recommend not to buy this but the 186 count instead.
1,"I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online."
2,"I was drawn to this DVD because of the title. It is a great workout, both cardio and strength. Lisa herself has communicated with me a few times to check in to see how I was doing and that impressed me a lot. Being new to exercising, I was not sure what to expect from this workout. Lisa's introduction on how to properly use the bells was great and is a workout in itself. I started out using a 10 lb. weight, even though she recommends 15-20 lbs. for women. The workouts are long enough so you feel it, but not too long as to interfere with your daily life. I am impatiently awaiting the second DVD from her. The only thing negative I can say is I wish I would have known what weights were recommended before purchasing. Overall, the exercised are great and really work different muscles than if you just used regular free weights. There are 3 workouts, upper, lower and circuit and all leave me feeling like I got a great workout."
1,so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.
2,"I'll start with the negatives:As someone else wrote, the tip-to-tip measurement isn't 54"". I just measured mine, and it's around 42"". That's a big difference. False advertising, I think it fair to say.Also (as the other writer wrote) it's odd that the sock (which fits around your light) is centered in the diffuser panel. Most everyone's lights are offset a bit (the shaft fits *next* to the light, not the middle), and so to get it to fit, you have to bend the umbrella quite a bit (which then deforms the reflector, because the umbrella is the reflector).Now the positives:That said, it does work, and the photographic results I've gotten are very good. All things considered, it's a good way to add a pseudo-softbox to your lights, for about $70. Better options are available, but they cost more, may be heavier, and take up more space. So, I view this as a good low-cost option, for those who aren't ready to plunk down thousands on a more sophisticated system."
1,"This printer, though mostly functional when connected to a Windows box, did not work without significant amounts of effort when connected to a Mac. Customer support at HP was not helpful in resolving my Mac connectivity issues. I eventually got it working with some 3rd party tools, but then the printer power supply died. I called HP customer support again and was told to buy a new HP printer.Needless to say, this is the last HP printer I will own. I suggest looking at some of the Brother models instead."
1,"This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. I saw The Velvet Rope in concert and absolutely loved it! This DVD however is a disgrace to Miss Janets talents. The sound is awful and the editing even worse. All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you. Otherwise we can only hope somebody makes a re-edit and remix version so the world can finally see a worthwile version of the concert. What a shame, what a waste."
2,"Merry Christmas and all that!! I have decided to PAY IT FORWARD!!! and give everyone I know ""Measure of a Man"" for the hoildays. What better way to pass on the joy of listening to and becoming emmersed in the awesome sound of Clay Aiken!!!! I feel it is one small thing I can do for mankind--- I suggest we all do the same!!! Happy Listening!!!"
2,"In my opinion, Escaflowne has the best soundtrack set of any animated series; all of the Escaflowne soundtracks are amazing and you wouldn't be disappointed if you had only one to choose from. That being said, this one is my personal favorite as it contains what I consider two of the most beautiful songs in the entire series (""Farewell"" and ""Arcadia"") plus a couple of performances from Maaya Sakamoto (whose voice is also divine). If you can get your hands on a copy, I strongly suggest getting this one. And while you're at it, check out other works composed by Yoko Kanno - she's simply amazing."
1,"The system works great and the clarity is perfect. The problem is when I reboot the computer, it takes 10 minutes. I just get a single flashing dot in the top left corner for 10 solid minutes and then it will finally boot up. If I unhook the printer, the system boots up normally... HELP!!!"
2,"I purchased this book for my husband after he saw it at a train show at a much higher price. He is an avid Wabash RR fan and collects what he can find on the Wabash, this book is mostly on specifications,plans, technical and reference material. He enjoyed receiving it and adding it to his collection."
2,"This doc does for Stalingrad what Ken Burns ""Civil War"" did to the ACW. Outstanding archival film research resulted in never before seen footage of Operation Blue & Stalingrad (especially life in the Kessel). 99% of the footage is genuine late 1942 vintage, and quite a bit in color. This is a MUST-SEE on HDTV. The doc also reveals a stunning secret regarding the Kessel, but I won't spoil it for you. I have $3K in English, Russian & German Stalingrad books/video, and I would buy this one again if I had the choice. You can't possibly regret this."
1,"Fish Hooks!!!?A portly George C. Scott reprises his role from the 1970 classic Patton. Too bad this movie is awful. Briefly stated, this is a sequel that should not have been made. The flimsy dialog, poor editing, and cumbersome made-for-television format do no justice to Francis Ford Coppola's original epic. Be sure to note the expanding belt-line... only a few months in movie-time, but Scott looked like he'd been hanging out with Marlon Brando for the 16 years between films."
1,"I don't normally write reviews unless I feel strongly about them, positive or negative. I feel so strongly negative about Pampers Baby Dry that I felt compelled to write this review. These diapers leak all the time. And not just when they're full- they leak even when the diaper is brand new and dry. They leak so astoundingly bad, that it's as if there is no diaper there at all. It surprises me, because I've actually had a great experience with Pampers Cruisers. I thought Baby Dry would be just as good as the Cruisers, but that hasn't been the case. I'd imagine that because every baby's body is built a little different, different diapers will fit better than others, so not everyone will have the same experience with the same diaper. All I can say is that, for my son, Baby Dry is about as bad as they can get. I'd go with Pampers Cruisers instead."
2,"I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"
1,"This book is 'just okay.' I came away from reading the book not knowing too much about the Amish. Sue prefers to keep most of the information to herself. She does, however, make sure she gets in adequate writing about all of her 'accomplishments' -- and makes apparent her desire to return to her old life of those accomplishments. (Big hairy deal!) Personally I think she's a bore....and a boor; actually I found her to be pompous. She had a wonderful idea which could have been made better. Sue Bender, you need to grow up."
2,"After 4 hours of troubleshooting, I finally found the article that indicated that the reason that my Wireless G USB Tivo Network Adapter would not work with my wireless network is because Tivo DVR software 8.1 is required to work with 802.11g.Of course, you get the wireless adapter so that you don't have to string a cable all the way across the house, and a phone line to download the latest software (released in 2006) is just stupid. so I found myself running a 50+ foot CAT5 cable across my house to download the software, and then discovered that I couldn't get the latest DVR software until I registered my Tivo unit.So not only did I buy a Tivo 2 years after 8.1 was released (9.3a is the current release as of this review), and not only did my unit show up with 8.0.1, but this software is incompatible with the Wireless G card I purchased.All in all, I'm wondering why Tivo claims to be easy."
2,"I've had this product over 6 months and moved it in a truck to a different house. It works great and is very dependable! It's heavy so it's not rickety and is attractive too. Mine is white and black. Very pleased with it and how easy it was to put together, take apart to move and put back together again. Recommend it highly."
2,"We have tried different diapers, but Pampers seem to be the best. They are soft, keep our baby dry and happy, and the velcro tabs are the best! I highly recommend them."
2,This was brought for my husband to finish his set. He has all of the seasons. It was one of our favorite shows on tv and it will be missed . at least this way we can watch it over and over .
2,"As always listening to his voice gives me chills! Its not his fault,but I could only give him a 4 out of 5. The producers and song writers stole the other point. Clay is so talented. He has proven over and over he can sing any song...so why dont the producers and song writers give him better material? Some of the songs are a little on the ""bubblegum"" side. Clay is a grown man and needs more grown up songs. The last thing I want for him is to see him not taken seriously because he is being produced for a quick dollar with the teen generation. He is too good for that. He needs some songs that are going to get airplay on adult stations. I would have liked some soft rock songs. ""No more sad song"" and ""Perfect Day"" just might make it. Dont take this as a bad review...on the contrary I would recommend it to everyone. I have not put it down since I got it the day of release. Its worth the money and aside from the few bubblegum songs the CD is great!"
2,"the film is great, more realistic than previous films, and the bonus dvd it's full of interesting material!!"
2,"Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single. I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I wouldn't guess that they've been trying to make a cd for 6 years, guys. They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out. So I would say that's a bit unfair to make that claim. Anyways I'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they've put out (except the What Evil Lurks E.P) and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single."
1,"To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. It was a very unhelpful sample, giving a selection of the introductory essay about Shakespeare's life and times.So I scoured the review page. None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page? Are there additional annotations beyond the essay about Shakespeare's life and times? Are there links to acts or scenes? Are there line numbers?"
1,"This book is not one that you quickly get through. It is very slow and dull in both story content and happenings involved. I would not and have not recommended the book since I purchased it. Actually, I threw the copy I purchased out because I did not want to subject anyone else to the boredom! If you are one that likes slow moving and unreadable books, then this is the one for you. I did not find it the list bit funny or have any true emotion over the book at all -- except for the fact that it is a waste of money!"
2,"I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. The first couple of wearings were difficult, but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me, I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter, as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping, but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep, rather than in the daytime, but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made."
1,"Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."
1,The dual tuner feature won't work on this model TiVo after June 2009. Don't buy it.
2,"Bring tissues. This play is so well written and such a difficult subject that people in today's society deal with every day, Suicide. Marsha Norman tries to help you understand both sides of situation when dealing with a plan suicide and how it effects relationships."
1,dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. The duet5s in particular have beengiven inappropriate arrangements.
2,"It comes in the box you see, the daipers are wrapped up tight in 3 big sets, it arrived in good time and has been a huge help with my newborn."
1,Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!
1,"We all know Tom Brokaw to be a second-rate, fear-peddling, shallow and unoriginal broadcaster. With this book, Brokaw manages to transplant all of these attributes to writing. As if poor and occasionally self-conciously florid writing did not make this book poor enough, Brokaw, as any mass-media ninny would do, focuses on truly trivial aspects of World War II, e.g., the experiences of ""victims"" -- women, etc. In the process, he completely eschews any meaningful tribute to what WWII was fought for, what any serious treatment of the subject would not leave out. The result is a thoroughly banal presentation of the most heroic and momentous event of the twentieth century. But, this is what I should have expected from a television newscaster. Churchill's ""The Second World War"" is still (by far) the best history of WWII, personal or otherwise. Is it any coincidence that WWII's greatest hero was also its greatest historian?"
2,"Whitman is the maxim singer of Myself , the human body , sex , the universal fraternity , the democratic equality , he is considered the supreme poet of North America , his work is deeply renovator, has became an inspiration source to the new generations . Leave of grass takes back almost his whole work.Published for the first time in 1855 , with nine corrected editions just before his death .America was then the famous symbol of an ideal . The whole world turned its eyes toward America and its athletic democracy . The virtuous capacity of Whitman of being many in one has had many followers such as Sandbourg, Neruda, Lee Masters , Bukowski but there is just one sublime exception : James Joyce in Finnegans Wake .But besides of him no one has been able to ascend these high peaks as Whitan did."
2,"If there ever was an album that says ""Roll Another Number"" it's this mellow, funky little gem. Whenever I listen to this I want to call up the bro's for a BBQ, chill out with some 40's rollin' fatties and talkin' about the ladies. OH YEAH!! If you like this music check out ""Jalamanta"" and Che- ""Sounds of Liberation"" if you can find'em. This is music for the people..Get it on!!"
2,"I had been looking for a book like this one for a long time and this one fills the bill. However, you're going to need a magnifying glass to read it- the print is REALLY small. I guess they had to use a small font to keep the book a reasonable size, but it induces more than a little eyestrain if you read it for more than a few minutes at a time."
1,Buyers should beware of this video since it is of very poor quality being taken from a less than perfect 16mm. print. We are accustomed to much better prints these days and this one is being sold under false pretence.
2,"this is a large blue eyes shining dragon figure from the Yu-Gi-Oh movie! this is the coolest toy. you can have the blue eyes shining dragon in attack mode or in flight mode. it also shoots a blue missle. it isnt very educational, but it is a lot of fun. it is very durable and well worth the money."
2,"System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album.Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels"
1,"We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
2,"Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that movie legit. Tons of laughs, emotion and of course the best action special affects you'll ever see. Definitely go see it if you loved the first 2 or even liked. You'll be into this one the whole way through"
2,"DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC."
2,"I bought this to go with my Delonghi EC155 espresso machine. Its a little big to fit under the wand, but it holds enough to make great lattes every time. I was surprisingly pleased with the quality for the price. I have hand washed it over the past couple months and it still looks like new."
1,"This trip down memory lane did not work for me. What was funny when I was a child, now pretty much not at all. Fodder for Goodwill."
1,"My Panasonic over-the-range microwave only lasted 1.5 years before it died on me. Panasonic wanted me to uninstall it, bring it to them and pay too much to have it repaired. It wasn't nearly as good as my GE over-the-range microwave which lasted more than 10 years!"
1,"In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
2,"The Hot Dog syndrome was fun to read. It kept me focused on the priorities of operating a successful business. I thought the ""voice"" was talking to me. Reading this book and applying its simple plan will benefit anyone who owns or operates a business. I could not wait to see what the ""voice"" was going to tell me next. I now keep the book handy at my desk to remind myself throughout my work day of its lessons."
2,"I had seen the movie based on this book years ago. The book has as much meaning in this day and age as it did when it was written.I was captivated by how stark, dirty, dingy, and hopeless the main charcter's view of the world is, even when trying to rebell.I think it's a very insightful look into just where a society can go. Even one with the best of intentions. It's very applicable in this era."
2,"Interesting and informative book! This book is helpful for all diabetics--even those who are very knowledgeable about diabetes. There's always something more to learn about this disease. The diet is very restrictive and challenging to follow. But, a person's health does win out ultimately."
1,"If you want to be enthralled by the story of the Essex, go to the source -- any one of the printings of Essex first mate Owen Chase's first-hand account in his ""Wreck of the Whaleship Essex"".His narrative takes you on the ship and grips you with the terror these men must have felt, adrift at sea with little food or water.Philbrick's retelling of the story doesn't capture the detail as well as one who was actually there.However, if you're looking for a history lesson on whaling, this one's not bad."
2,It was really good but Ramsey was hardly in it and it bothered me his appearance was only described as handsome and nothing more. And the girl was so dumb if she'd stop declaring her love for Brodick for two seconds maybe she'd realize she was married. But she was cool apart from that flaw. I liked where the story went.
2,"This is a good movie. Made with low budget and yet great locations, the story just flows easily. We've seen movies like this before, and still it's a pleasure to watch the talented and handsome and strong actor Kevin Sorbo as a military leader searching for a scary soldier...Indeed, a fun movie!"
2,"Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans."
2,Pro - Product is of the highest quality. Con - I'm looking for rivets to fit this unit and can't find them!! Amazon do not carry them.
2,"I bought ""Heritage of the Star"" (UK title) when I was 11, more or less at random from the Puffin Book Club, and it remained my favourite book for years and was lent to everyone I know. It was one of the first science fiction books I had ever read that made me THINK (and wasn't just Boys Stuff in Space), and its outcome surprised and amazed me. It had never occurred to me that there could be sequels, so I was delighted to find this trilogy at Amazon and finally read the rest of the story. Science (and Science Fiction) may have moved on, but this remains one of the best stories for teenagers (and everyone else) I've ever read; it deserves a much higher profile - buy it for yourself and every young person you know who likes to daydream and think about the bigger things in life."
2,The author is an amazingly talented man.. The book is deep and superb I highly recommended for those that are interested in Gegg's research He is superb..
1,"while this plot line may have some twists and turns that have a newer spin, this book isn't ""new"" in terms of a fast paced thriller. Mr. Berry does keep the reader engaged, but with so many other books on the market with similiar plot lines centering around the Church, well, one can see the ending before it actually happens. The characters are pretty much stererotypical, the woman hard-boiled woman who has lost her faith and so forth and then the ""love interest"".However, if you need a good read on the plane or while traveling, pick it up!"
1,"I didn't like this book when I was a child. I don't like it as a an adult. It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like ""Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P."" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read ""Karen"" and ""With Love from Karen"" instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like ""Wren"" does. I didn't like this book at all. I agree -- ""Wren"" really is for the birds."
2,"I just bought my first cd in years.Its The Clay Aiken MOAM.Ive been trying to pick A favorite and its impossible.When I listen to one ,I say thats the best,then when the next track has ended I say oh man that has to be the next single.I am glad im not the one that makes the decisions on the next single.I can hear and reconize the words,I can sing along,I get a good feeling.I feel no need to run from the police or to go slap anyone ,to shake my booty,nor to start cussing,so maybe im out of the loop to feel good about what ive heard.I must be so uncool,because i actually feel good and think maybe the world will all get better.I could not say it the way I feel but if i had a month to say it just right I could do a better job.Thank You Clay for making the sun shine brighter today."
1,"I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. My old rice cooker had a separate lid and I never noticed this difference in my research. This one is fixed on. I wish I had read the review that said the same thing I am now saying and took note. It's impossible to clean around all the gaskets and time consuming to try. Major design flaw. Other than that, it does make great rice."
2,"Very happy with purchase. Item was shipped fast, nicer than expected and the price was very reasonable. Ping to be a nice Christmas gift."
2,"I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter. He wears it on his shorter, usually 10 mile runs, and also in the gym. I like the way he looks it in, he likes the feel. I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size. Will probably purchase another for Christmas."
2,"This book contains some great photos of 9/11. Among the most striking are the dual page spreads on pages 72-73 and 92-93. Take a look for yourself at the unburnt paper everwhere and the satalite photo of the ""Dust Plume/Cloud"" respectively.Then do yourself a favor and take a look at the only foresic scientific study of the evidence.Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11"
2,"Janet Is Truly Amazing . I Went To See Her Concert Here In Johannesburg , South Africa . It Was Unbelievable . I Bought The Vhs Tape Of The Velvet Rope And Now I Am Back To Buy The Dvd Version . I Can Watch The Tape Over And Over Again . Janet Is Truly Entertaining . I Actually Did Not Expect The Concert To Be That Great , But I Would Really Stunned . The Choreography Was Really Out Of This World . I Recommend This Movie To Everybody . For 2 Hours , You Are Transformed To A World Of Magic And Excitement . I Can Guarantee That You Will Love It . Thank You Janet For Your Outstanding Performance , It Will Honestly Remain A Part Of Me For A Very Long Time ! !"
1,"This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing."
2,"It does not matter if you are interested in Struts. This book is written with a view to the ideas behind Struts and in any MVC architecture for a web framework. This is a tour de force in knowledge of the area, punctuated by the succinct sizzle of a man that knows how to communicate. Ted Husted is a writer among writers in this area."
1,I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt. Although it was somewhat interesting it wasn't doing what I needed it to and that was to teach me not to want to disappear before I got up in front of a group of people.
1,"at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!"
1,"I bought this so I could share movies and vids from my computer to the tivo and play them on our TV. You still need to pay for a monthly subscription thou. You also need to pay for some software to enable you to do it. I realized it was easier to get a wireless video/audio sender and and send the movies wirelessly to the tv for $0 per month. However, I suppose there is a market for this somewhere its just not for me and my house."
1,"Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects."
2,"We bought one of these and put it in our kitchen. It worked just as we hoped it would, so I bought 6 more - two for gifts, and four for us. I read other reviews before I executed the second purchase, noting the negative comments. We decided to purchase even though some people had received faulty units. Of the seven total, all have worked flawlessly. I highly recommend this product!"
2,"Ever wonder ""What If""? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!"
2,Perhaps the greatest of the works by Thomas Hardy. It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb.
1,"Okay...........I'll admit that The TeddyBears got a good hit in ""CobraStyle"".........however, someone out there please reference me back to a hit from the 60's or 70's that has the same beat and melody and a lot of organ and drums.Please...............it is driving me crazyTed in the Sanitarium Lobby"
1,"I borrowed this book in hard-copy form from a friend. The regular book is great. It is written in an easily digestible manner while still covering the material in surprising depth. I found the use of figures and illustrations to summarize concepts particularly well executed. I was incredibly disappointed by the Kindle version I bought for use on my Kindle DX. The text looked like it had been scanned from a copy of a copy made on an old xerox machine. Parts of the letters in the text were missing and the general appearance of the text was blurry. The figures did not line up with the text well, and their quality was not good. I want to make a switch to buying textbooks on the kindle. But if the other book conversions are as poorly executed as this one, then I will stick to buying used hard copies. I would rate the hard copy as a 4 or 5 star book, but I have to give the kindle version a 2 for the lackluster conversion."
2,"I've always loved Pampers diapers and found these to be a great deal- especially when coupled with Amazon Mom and the subscribe and save option. However, now that my daughter is in size three, we found that we needed night-time diapers for her to wear to bed. She leaked through these quite a few times. Once we got the bedtime diapers, I loved these diapers for daytime. They're not too bulky and wear really well."
2,"This is definitely a well written book. It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK."
1,I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download. Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
1,The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.
1,"Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine"
1,"What should we do with Clay Aiken's amazing vocal abilities and unique style? Apparently, tone him down, give him barely passable bubble gum pop ballads (with laughable lyrics), and do everything the studio can to make him sound as generic as possible. Clay, find new handlers!"
1,"I purchased 204 Pampers Baby Dry Diapers. They are different from ones I have bought in the past. The first week we used them, my 10 month old son peed through his diaper two nights (which he had never done previously) in the middle of the night. They are thin and do not stand up to wetness the way other pampers do. Now I have to go out and buy night diapers to get through all these diapers. I will never buy these again."
2,"All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
1,"I've read this book and the first sequel, and was extremely disappointed with both. Brokaw is a poor writer, and a lousy editor. Although there are undoubtedly great stories to be told here, Brokaw manages to reduce the life stories of the greatest generation to tedium. It just isn't worth wading through the muck for the occasional nugget of good story.As a gift for someone of the WWII generation, this book might make sense. Otherwise, a person's time would be better spent by reading a WWII book from someone else. Or perhaps by watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" again.Skip this loser, and the loser sequel. There are better choices out there."
1,"On the one hand, I loved the book, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. However, my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of ""The Age of Reason"". When they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books, they should remove this review. At that point, I will eagerly buy a new copy."
1,"I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
1,"This fan heater can oscillate, which is controlled by the foot switch (i.e., the foot switch doesn't turn the heater on or off). You can tilt the heater, too, but not by much. Overall, the heater feels cheaply made and soemtimes it doesn't work; I have to unplug and replug it to make it go again.The markings for the two knobs (left for power/fan level, right for thermostat) are *very* hard to see; they are almost non-existent. This is a very stupid design decision.I wouldn't buy this heater again despite its low price and good safety features."
2,"I have read over 100 books, but none as fabulous as this one. I know, I know, it's just a pony pals book! But this book had real meaning. I don't know why Angela or whoever is complaining about nothing bad ever happing to them, because that was exactly what happened in this book. The Pony Pals go away to a riding clinic. No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!! This book was very touching and helped me realize that ponies are just as good as horses, if not better."
1,The software for this unit does not support Windows XP. The unit is not of much use without being able to interface with the computer.
1,"I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection. It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy. Unfortunately, the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB ""A"" cable end - which is what I really needed. If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that, but not the adapters themselves."
1,"At first when I realized this book had been taken up my a mainstream publisher I thought great I will definitely give this one a chance since I am a huge fan of everything zombie related.I do regret buying this book. It's not often that I have regrets about something I have purchased but this is one of those times.The story is nothing special or in fact, new. The writing reads amateurish and when I was finished reading I knew I definitely would NOT go any further into this series.For fans of the genre, if you are looking for action stay away. This book was rather mundane and boring."
1,"the quality of the lcd display is terrible, low visibility and with a ""rainbow"" effect on the surface. backlighting of the LCD display is woefully inadequatethe operating manual is barely sufficient.the scanner itself hang up on the first time i used and i could not power it down any more i returned it the first day i got it"
2,"Pretend that you've ever heard of Jack Kerouac. Forget you've ever heard the words ""Beat Generation."" Set down your ideas of what life should be like. Read this book. It will make you want to sell all your worldly possessions in a mammoth yard sale and take off to find It."
1,"A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie."
1,"This bed is very cute! But the sides do not come up high enough, to at act as side rails. But high enough to cause injury when rolling around in the bed, as my toddlers do. But, your toddler will love it...and you'll need to buy a new bed soon."
2,It is a good headset in terms of clarity (incoming sound). Outgoing voice is a little low (according to some listeners). Battery life is fair.
1,"I ordered several boxes of these and was very disappointed to find that these are not the improved ""flex"" kind. I only switched from cruisers to the baby dry because they were stretchy. Now I have several boxes of diapers that barely fit."
1,"I have ordered this set and then returned it and had a replacement set sent. Both sets have had one CD that has music missing in bits and pieces. I assume that all sets have been cut from the same master set, since both sets I have received are flawed."
1,"This album is wat too bluesy. I don't understand Eric Clapton's diabloical obsession with the blues. The blues is silly and outdated. So is this album. There are a couple of standout tracks, but most of it is just psychedelic blues. GIBBERISH! That's what most of this is! GIBBERISH! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not? I for one, do not."
2,"while this book is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book. On the whole a good read which reflects how things were at the time of the Manson Murders but ultimately a little unsatisfactory, somehow."
1,"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
2,"I first picked up 'The Satanic Mill' when I was in Primary School. Now, seven years later, the book popped back into my head and I remembered how much I had loved it when I first read it all those years ago. So I bought a copy, and read it - and despite an ice-age of seven years, I still loved it."
2,"I love this rice cooker, it lets me eat rice whenever I want, with its timer settings. Not only that, it has appropriate cooking settings - perfect for any kind of rice cooking. I personally like semi-brown rice, so I just put rice in, set the timer for 7am night before, then eat the rice all day for all my meals.I also saw this rice cooker at 99 Ranch market for 120 dollars so maybe it's a better deal than Amazon. I got 25 off for this from amazon but if you can get to 99 ranch, get it there instead if you can find it."
2,"This book is a must have for anyone that uses Six Sigma, is learning Six Sigma, or wants to advance their Quality career.This book gives insight into the ""why"". Why Six Sigma is being implemented, Why it's so ""hot"", Why it can turn any company around, and Why it's better than TQM.While the book is mainly aimed at those in leadership positions, I believe that anyone that has a thirst for knowledge on Six Sigma should pick up this book. For those of you who need to implement Six Sigma buy it in conjunction with The Six Sigma Way Team Field Book. Everything you ever wanted to know about Six Sigma can be found in these two books."
1,"Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
2,"I read some of the unfavorable reviews, saw the low price and figured it was a dog. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although the cover is totaly misleading. Keeps you guessing to the end."
2,I have been looking for a new mug warmer for quite some time in Canada. I finally resorted to buying it online from the U.S. It is a lot better than the old one I had previously and am quite happy with it. We actually use it to keep our espresso carafe warm.
1,"This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
1,"I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("
2,I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
2,"The Saris bike rack worked out great. I had borrowed a three bike Saris rack from a friend and decided to get one for myself. I only needed a rack to carry two bikes so thats what I ordered. When it arrived I was taken aback by the fact it wasn't quite like my friends although it looked exactly like it in the online picture. It only had one upper arm rather then two like my friends. Over wise it was identical. I almost sent it back but decided to try it out instead. Glad I did because my concerns about stability with just one upper arm was quickly dispelled. Great rack, rock solid."
1,"Oasis achieved phenomenal success with the release of their 1995 album ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory,"" but then followed the unfortunate trend of having their next album suffer. Still, ""Be Here Now"" has its moments. The best song on here is obviously ""All Around the World"". It's long, pretentious, and has a stunning music video to go along with it; it's reminiscent of the Guns N' Roses' song ""November Rain"". The album also houses ""The Girl in the Dirty Shirt,"" which is the nasaliest of any song Liam's sung before or since. The rest of the album is mostly just OK, making this a major disappointment given the brilliance of their last album. Oasis completists will want this album; everybody else would be wise to just buy ""All Around the World"" as a single and leave it at that."
1,"It is now official: According to a poll done by the book ""British Hit Singles and Albums"" and ""NME.com"", 2 June 2006, this is now the No.1 album of all time. It has displaced ""Sgt. Pepper"". Yeah, and the Dave Clark 5 are better than the Beatles, Diabelli is better than Mozart, Cherubini is better than Beethoven, Def Leppard is better than the Rolling Stones, and Oasis is better than ANYONE that ever made a rock album. Give me a break. It is listenable. That is about all you can say positive about it. I could say a lot that is negative, but what's the point? The Monkees ""Greatest Hits"" album has more innovation (really, I'm serious -- I'm not knocking the Monkees). The most overrated album of all time. Put your money to better use."
1,Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?
2,"the pitcher is great for frothing milk for 2 servings.the only con is that the handle hurts my hand if i hold it in a certain way. the edges of the handle isn't rounded, so this is the reason why.other than this, its great. you can easily make latte arts using this."
1,This crowes album was by far their worst album to date....whith their departure of bassist Johnny Colt...and lead guitarist Marc Ford...the band has suffered spiritualy and musically...Chris's lyrics are leering more to the clesche Rock..girl relationship bullcrap lyrics...Three Snakes And One Charm had alot more depth and soul in the music...The only song I really dig is HorseHead..because it funks out and it aint about some lovey dubby sappy girl song... Buy Amorica or Three Snakes...those albums will make you cry it's so spritual... Peace and Soul... Zed
1,"I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold."
1,"Don't blow 35 bucks on this because it says it's ""unrated"", here. They're ALL UNRATED, and you can find the same thing for just a few bucks elsewhere on this site!"
2,"I was disappointed the product received didn't match the photo here; there was no flange on the top as indicated in the photo. The other drawback was the fact the holder was 'closed' at the bottom; I intended to use this as a net holder and wanted the handle to pass all the way through.Those things said...the vendor was very responsive to my request for return and full credit. Then, having had the weekend to consider, I was able to cut out the bottom of the liner sleeve, thus allowing the net handle to pass through as desired!I haven't had the boat on the water yet, but expect this unit to perform just fine."
1,Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
2,"Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?"
1,"This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!"
1,"I have read alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this book is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff.His other works are consistant and valuable, among the most valuable words ever written,This book has less wisdom than the average person on the street"
1,"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."
2,"The story is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Sadly, the author passed away on October 8, 2002, so there won't be any more in the series."
1,"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."
1,"I have to say that after becoming immersed in 1632 and enjoying 1633, I feel like the author's pretty much abandoned the project to whoever wants to publish some small snippet. This was the worst of the series by far and I actually just gave up on it half way though which I never ever do to fiction. I truly wanted to see the author embrace this universe and allow me to come along for an enjoyable ride. Looks like it's not going to happen. Probably need to hold off or write your own version since that's kind of what got published anyway."
1,I ordered two of these for my kids. The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping. There is a trigger to lock in the rocket while pumping but the trigger is in the way of holding the pump and is unsafe because a simple bump makes the rocket launch accidentally. The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets. The rocket's highest flight was about 10 feet becuase the pumps were so lame.
2,"I was assigned this book to read in 10th grade ""American Literature"" class. Suprisingly this book was enjoyable to read and had a few events that caught me off guard. I loved this book and would recommend this to anyone of any age."
2,"Perfect rice everytime. And you don't even have to be there. And it'll keep rice perfect and hot for up to 24 hours. And there are settings for white rice, brown rice, sushi rice and more.We cook family dinner more often because of the Neuro Fuzzy. I make bento lunches for my son and my family more often with the Neuro Fuzzy. Any sushi dish must start with perfect rice. We use Tamaki Gold rice in our neuro fuzzy.It's a small investment for happiness, family meals, picnics, and perfection."
2,"Short and sweet. As other reviews point out, yes, this may not have anything new, but it is written so well and so simply, that all you've read before finally sinks in!"
2,"I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since ""The Secret"" for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more ""irresistible"". I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in ""The Secret"" to be that exciting. At any rate, ""Ransom"" is well written and I did enjoy reading it."
1,"This DVD of Rod Stewart and The Faces In Concert is a total BOOTLEG. The cover is with Ronnie Lane who was not in the band during the recording of this concert. This DVD is the final concert with Keith Richards. I'm sick and tired of companies putting out concerts with different covers of the same ones you already have. It's like bait and switch. And I am a number one Faces fan and this is a load of BS. And for those looking at the Rod Stewart and the Faces: Live In London, this DVD is the DVD featuring Keith Richards in his final concert, different cover. And honestly, this is the weakest show of the Faces I have ever seen because of Tetsu. You cannot even hear his bass in this DVD. I have a bootleg of this DVD that's a better quality than this one. Please do not put money in the pocket of this company, the only good thing about this is the cover.Yours truly,Number One Faces Freak."
2,"As a baby boomer of WWII, I enjoyed ""The Greatest Generation"" very much. I even shared the book w/several Vets of WWII (men & women), which they enjoyed it also. I would have shared it w/my father if he were alive today. I didn't realize the descrimination that went on; but I'm glad they 'stuck it out'."
2,"You can read the other reviews to hear what a great classic of French New Wave cinema this is.My only complaint with the DVD is the narrow-screen ""pan and scan"" format, and the sound quality. The picture quality is very nice but they made this DVD from a VHS restoration, so the sound quality is only so so, with a low hiss permeating the sound track. I wish they had a letterbox edition!"
2,"I have one of those ""spare tire"" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to ""make"" me look trimmer..."
1,We don't know what they were thinking when they chose this book as required reading but it was bad with a capital B. We love reading but give us a break. Lord of the flies must have been written by another author. We do not recommend this book unless you need help falling asleep.
1,"I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!"
2,"These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. Very easy to use."
1,"Can't return, I guess, don't know how to get a hold of seller. Connections not good, I only get left ear speaker to work w/cord but without it works headphones work fine. So it's the cord. It's a shame really as the cord it self seems to be of good quality. Oh well, you can't judge a book by it's cover."
2,Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.
2,"this movie shows the untold story of what happened between bruce wayne being a small kid and when he was batman.the fighting was pretty good.well bruce is not some big time millionairre hes a prisoner like in tibet or somewhere.then he trains as a ninja.he learns from ra za ghul.raz is played by qui gon jinn.then he goes like crocodile dundee and goes to the concrete jungle like countless others to america to fight crime.in america he battles scarecrow..hes quite a bit more brutal than the tim burton batmen,which is really cool.morgan freeman plays this guy who makes batmans toys.commissioner gordan is still quite a bit younger than normal. .the best thing about it by far is the tank like batmobile!now that fn rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he had an ol lady,but she was crabby the whole time so who cares?i have every batman movie made and they ARE ALL not as cool as this one[written before dark knight]......i say if you've watched the other 6 batman movies then watch this one too."
2,"This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods. The only issue is that you can't get it too hot; if you want to add it to soup, you've got to let it cool a bit first."
2,"I'm what you call a narutard, this version of sasukes anti leaf headband is awesome. I sort of expected to receive a cruddy metal with cloth flimsily attatched, but it was bolted to the cloth, the cloth was durable and tough, the metal was the real steel, and it bent wherever I wanted it to... definately buy from this seller"
2,"Julie's newest book was the best yet. I have read every single one of the books she wrote, and never have I been disappointed. Gillian and Brodick are what each of us hope to find in love. Ramsey was the typical male who wouldn't know love until it left him. Julie, please write more on Ramsey and Bridgid, you left us hanging! I will read this again and again until Julie comes out with her new book."
1,New 2575 Christmas 2005. HP rep in CompUSA approached me when I was in to get a Lexmark cartridge for my old printer. Short sales pitch later I walked out with a new HP 2575. It printed only 160 sheets before paper feed failed. HP sent a replacement under warranty. The replacement printed 262 sheets before the same problem emerged. Never abused or jammed. Used only HP paper. Stay away from this one. Read the other emails. Clearly a design defect. Sure wish I hadn't tossed that Lexmark out.
2,I just got this in today.Got it hooked up.So far so good.I have it powering four Sony SS-B1000 5 1/8-Inch Bookshelf Speakers.Signal to input 2 is from my computer.Input 1 gets it's signal from my iPod.The signal switching works as advertised.As soon as i press play on my iPod it switches over instantly to input 1.Nice.The A B speaker selector works as it should.Choose either set A or B. Or press both buttons at the same time to power all four speakers.In this configuration each one receives about 30watts rms.Plenty for my set up.Pretty loud and clear sitting in front the computer.lol.Sound is great also.No comments on the auto shut off.I have it switched off and I just manually turn it off since its within arms reach.All in all im very happy with it so far.Good price.Good sound.Works like it should.
2,"Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film. It is a fast paced heart pounder which leaves you lterally breathless afterwards. The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully. The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well. The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed. this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999. Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries. i hope to see more great exports soon!"
1,"In Tom Robbins ""Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates"" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages. I now understand why."
2,"this movie is good not great because it follow the comics but not batman personalty micheal keaton got it right as far batman make up don,t get me wrong bale did a good actor but he got batman wrong i read the comics the batman keaton got right blade was better than this movie because wesley carries the darkness of blade bale don,t carry that well two because bale did he better val and geoge than two his verison it,s just as good as the frist batman movie not better than keaton this is better than superman returns for one the joker didn,t kill his pranets mr,s fox is in it ."
1,If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights.
1,"I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries."
2,"For anyone who has ever wondered how the five human senses works, this is the tape to purchase! This film of the flagship series NOVA introduces a wealth of knowledge on seeing, hearing, feeling, taste, and smell. Anyone who has seen anything educational program from the NOVA series, now on PBS across the nation, knows the quality of their documentaries. This tape is no exception. This film is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring these five basic functions of the body, taken for granted everyday. A real winner, this video will not disappoint!"
1,"iguess you have to be stoned to enjoy this moviebecause any other way its just bad its just not interesting ,not funny, not worth it"
2,"No spiritual experience like the Flat Earth, but I was won over by Esther's determination & vulnerability. A reminder of our humanity."
2,"I had a friend of a friend hand this book to me, obviously excited about it. I thought this was odd at the time, until I read it. This book falls into the rare category of books that I will definitely re-read. And I'm not a fan of Chronicles of Narnia, or Lewis' other writings."
1,"If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive."
2,"It really works! I am in love. I was trying to get my pre-pregnancy 21 in waist back for 10 months now. I got to 23in and kind of got stuck there. With Squeem I went from 23 in waist to 21in in just 2 minutes! Start hooking it from the top, much easier. Buy it! You won't regret!"
2,Must Read! One of my favorite books. All of my sisters really loved it too! Very enjoyable for all ages.
2,"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
1,"This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir! The remix WAS better."
2,"Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."
1,I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
1,"This will be a very short review. I have used Amazon for a number of years expecting fair and equitable treatment and reasonable value. Hence, I purchased this trainer via Amazon. When the unit arrived on the appointed date, the delivery people refused to assemble and set-up the unit. They could barely utter a word of english, but they had a document that indicated if tools were required they couldn't do any work. Well the unit comes in a number of subasseblies and lot's of parts, so there is no way this could be assembled without a fairly extensive toolbox. I certainly don't have the expertiese to do it either. I will now have to find someone willing and able to assemble the device. I will not buy anything from this vendor again, and will try to avoid using Amazon in the future as well. You are foolish if you buy anything in this way because Amazon washes their hands of their resellers, even though they are making money on these transactions."
1,Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
2,I have literally tried every diaper for my son there is out there... these seem to stuck with him the longest... The only problem I am having now is that he moves around so much that the diaper comes undone sometimes if he's not wearing pants.. .even tried a bgger size and it still does it.. I guess my child is just way over active...
1,"The handheld version with 4 answer buttons does not compare to it's big brothers. The deluxe versions have more answer buttons to help tailor the answers better than the handheld one, so it seems to be a bit smarter. I would go with the deluxe versions instead of the handheld..."
1,"The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size, I had to return for a credit or an exchange. It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling. If I understand your policy, and you have the correct size and ship that, I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping. That means for a purchase of about forty dollars, I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra. I would never purchase another clothing item from [...]."
1,"I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"
1,"where to bloody begin.... ah.. in my junior year i and everyone else in class was forced to read the book and watch the horrible origanal slow and boring movie. after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck, right at the same time. both this and the great gatsby sucked. but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it"
2,"This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. It maps the mindset and events during this dramatic change. It is told with a direct, personal style that I found gripping, and that gives a very good sense of the societal changes and impacts. I highly recommend it."
2,My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!
2,"You can still see the lighted buttons and it prevents dirt and dust from getting inside the Mac. When it gets dirty or sticky I just wash it with soap and completely dry it then put it back on. Good investment for a $4,000 Laptop. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,"I have not completely set this item up yet, but thus far looks like a great mattress for extra sleeping accommodations. Is for my college-age son via family visits...."
1,"Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."
1,"Just like a real museum, everything in Namco Museum is OLD. I grew up in the 80's. I played Atari and Colico. I remember Pong, Missile Command and many others. I remember that they only kept my attention for about twenty minutes at a time."
2,"These movies are all gems, confirming the great teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Somehow seeing them together never gets old. I also have The Thin Man series on DVD and this is every bit as good. I would have liked to see a few more extras, including commentaries or interviews, but the movies themselves are worth the price. It's a great chance to see lesser known but great films by great stars."
1,"Jefferson Starship at the time(1983)had released 3 outstanding albums, Freedom at Point Zero, Modern Times, Wind of Change. If anyone had the opportunity to see the band with drummer Ansley Dunbar, You know how disappointing this video is. Unfortunately, when listening to songs like ""Stranger"" you could hear the bands new drummer(???)the mistakes and missed drum fills. It's a shame that the band never released any Video performance of the band with Dunbar. It's a good mix of song selection. Too bad they didnt fine tune the playing.(Why didnt they play ""Save Your Love"" ""Lightening Rose"" ""RockMusic"")"
1,"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an ""F"" grade. It squeeks two stars."
2,"I really enjoyed this book, she risked everything to help someone she barely knew, and whom she was supposed to hate! It was beautiful what she did, and deserves to be called a classic. I have it on tape too and thats really good also. Read it!"
1,"Buyer Beware - Another Rip-off. An hour ago I thought that I was buying this dictionary. What I received instead on my AmazonKindle was The New Oxford American Dictionary. This is not the first times that I have been cheated like this, but I assure you that it will be the last!"
1,I've had to throw at least 6 onesies because of the leakage riding up my sons back:( awful my next attempt is to try pampers swaddles while he still fits into their size. Hopefully they work out since there are many good reviews.
1,These diapers are terrible. I'm not sure the diapers in the box are actually Pampers. They leak--and not just out the legs or up the back. Right through the part of the diaper that is supposed be the most absorbent. The box says they are good for 12 hour overnight protection--a joke. Maybe three hours. Every time I've used these overnight my baby (14 lbs) has woken up soaked.
2,"I don't know much about Pope Clement XV, the Vatican, and the Church, but I was completely satisfied after reading this novel. The amount of negative reviews this book has received is amazing. It's really a fascinating read if you allow yourself to get into it. After the book was over I can say I learned something. It's a solid read."
2,"This is a very simple to operate and straightforward coffee machine that makes flavourful coffee without any snafus. The drip stop function works perfectly, the shape of the carafe keeps coffee fresher than most designs, there are no clocks to set or automatic hot plate shut offs. The construction is sturdier than others (Krups, Cuisinart made in Mexico or China); it is made in Germany. The lack of a clock/timer is no big deal as it will get your first cup of coffee brewed-- and brewed RIGHT-- in two minutes."
1,"Could not get it to stick to the window. Would stick it to the window and it would fall off every 10 to 20 min. Even got it wet for better suction, lasted about an hour before it fell off. Gave up after that. Unknown if thermometer worked. Never got it to stick."
1,"I had this book for three terms of calculus, and it was a headache. For every one person who liked the book, there were fifty who didn't. The authors, in trying to take a ""leaner, more conceptual approach"" to calculus, thoroughly confuse. The chapters on series and sequences are impossible to understand, and no practical problems are included in them. A good textbook supplements the material presented in lecture, and this one certainly did not. To summarize: this book presents calculus in a way that makes it seem far, far more complicated than it really is. And, to top it off, this is an *experimental* textbook that has been around for years. Time to conclude the experiment; it failed!"
2,"Any fan of the Band's music would get a lot out of seeing this documentary, which reveaks the creative process that went into their two masterworks, ""Music From Big Pink"" and ""The Band"". Band"" the story of Music from Big Pink is also covered here. Great interviews and stories from producer/engineer Joe Simon, and band members Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as well as a fitting obit to Richard Manuel."
1,"this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????"
1,The product was delivered on time. When I inspected the bench I noticed one of the Upright Stanchions had improperly drilled holes to connect the Upright Cross Bar. Thus the bench was unusable. Called customer service for Phoenix health and Fitness INC. Hopefully they will be able to remedy the situations. Until then I just wasted my money.
2,"I'm really impressed by this 4 CD collection. Apart from his last 1952 the CD's covers Hank Williams' entire career. hough it's slightly frustrating having to look out for his last recordings somewhere else, this is really a great buy. The sound surprisingly good, even the radio acetates from his Health and Happiness shows sound good, and it's very interesting to experience a little of how Williams was a a live performer. The 52 pages booklet contains a detailed biography and a lot of information about Hank's sessions and recordings.Highly recommended"
2,"purchased for two reasons: first, for a video presentation (connect to computer and speakers); second, for playing music at home and on the go. it works fine and is a great value for the money. buyer's remorses - would like a similar sized and quality product that has a remote control and bass/treble features"
1,"This being my all time favorite movie, I bought this DVD as a backup to one I already have. I was not so impressed as the main menu was different (look and music) and the contents indicated on the back cover of this ""deluxe edition"" were not there (recepies, etc) I fail to see what is so ""deluxe"" about it. I will always recommend this movie but maybe not the ""deluxe edition"" because it is nothing special. I also had problems starting it (I initially thought something was wrong with my DVD player. . .haven't watched it again as my original version is much better."
2,"This product is about half the price of that offered from apple. It does not have a charge light, but for me it isn't worth the price. Product charges the battery, which is all I am looking for."
1,"this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums, actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy. Had i known this movie was so bad, i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY!!!!"
1,"Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
1,The entire DVD seems to be more instructional than anything else. There isn't much of a workout at all. In between some of the movements there is a splash on the screen while a huge amount of rest time goes by and this is where you are told how to workout using what has been demonstrated. And by told it says that if you are a beginner you do this many sets and if you are intermediate you do this many and if you are advanced you do this many but that is it. There isn't much to follow after that. Even the warm-up in the cardio section leaves you cold.All in all I am still in search of a basic kettlebell workout that requires a little bit of effort. I was hoping this was it.
2,Great songs for a great artist. Clay Aiken is one of a kind. Brilliant vocal performances.
1,"I've tried ordering this title twice, and received the CD ""Canada Songs"" by the Daughters instead both times. I've since discovered that when you add it to your cart, it comes up as Naked Apes and Pond Life by Daughters (which still doesn't explain why I got the Canada Songs CD by Daughters). Arrgh. I've given up on ordering it until Amazon corrects it's database."
2,"Fabulous movie, can watch it over and over. Received quickly and as described. Love it love it love it"
1,"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
1,Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick. The vibrations weren't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off. I didn't get any benefit from it and I don't think he got much.
1,"I find this cup warmer only keeps my coffee lukewarm at most even starting with hot coffee. I work at the computer and when I stop to reach for my cup, I want hot coffee, so it was definitely a disappointment."
1,"I cant believe these movies on double disk put all the loaded stuffs on disk ,And hard work, which most people don't care, then they put 5.1 audio sound crap to it, such as awful...please people if u do all the goodies an all on DVDS at least put the DTS sound to it for most people like me have surround sound these days at home..Such movies like this kind of gender u should have a blast high-end sound to it to really enjoy the movie such as DTS ...for this important matter I give 2 starts and I am not going to buy this DVD."
2,"The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
1,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
1,"This poor character never catches a break, and the writer makes you care for her, deeply. Emotionally draining and depressing"
2,"Who would not like Bjork? Her celestial voice sends shivers up your spine. Her tonal quality and dynamics are extremely unique. And her lyrics, oh her lyrics. They paint images like a master surrealist. Lyrics like, ""I walk towards the edge and throw little things off like car-parts, bottles and cutlery, or whatever I find lying around.."" make music all worth it. Absurd, beautiful and intense. What more could annyone want. Bjork, please marry me."
1,I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
2,"My daughter has a lot of shoes. She used to just either leave them on the floor or would toss them in a empty laundry basket.The rack was easy to put together and so far have had no problems. It holds all of her shoes and takes up little space.The only drawback I saw was that you see the bottoms of the shoes and you wouldn't want to put heavier shoes all on one side.We are very pleased and if the needs again arises, I will buy another one. I am glad I bought it."
1,"Unfortionately Miss Patti Page doesn't have the talent or chops to pull off a jazz session. Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying. Stay awa yfrom this and just go out and buy any CD by Anita O'Day or June Christy, but for Heaven Sake's don't buy this."
2,"You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe."
1,"Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy."
2,"I found it to be a good movie to watch as the women of the mansion try and solve the ""murder"" of the patriarch. Each woman has some sort of a relationship with the ""deceased"". They have a pivotal role in the involvement of the man and confess their secrets. The movie itself was good but it could do much better without the musicals."
2,"I couldn't wait for this cd to be released and I wasn't disappointed in the least. Each and every song will bring you to tears, they are that good. (Bear in mind that this is coming from a huge John Lennon fan - but one who has already seen Clay perform with the American Idols this summer). Invisible is as good as it was on the tour - but my personal favorites are The Way (co-written by Enrique Inglesias) and Perfect Day. Both will give you chills. Love you Clay. You are a tremendous role model - continue to be the wonderful human being you truly are. A fan - Diane Casserly"
2,this cd is great. if you are a zelda fan you need this cd. i got it when i was recently in japan. its great music just the same as the games music.
1,"By the time when I wanted the size 3 diapers for my baby, Pampers swaddlers were not available and I had to buy these after reading the reviews . The problem with these are they don't have the wet indicator and the baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on.It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!This is almost the one of the existing reviews."
1,"Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears.Jabra EarGels - ClearI suppose in theory they should work to channel the sound into your ear, but that's only if the pieces fits into your ear, I didn't get a chance to test that aspect."
2,So far so good. I have used power adapter since my Apple Adapter got a short in the cord. I have owned various Apple Laptops and almost all of the power adapters have needed replacing. I like to buy Apple branded replacements but they cost twice as much as this one. I have been using it for several weeks without any problems.
2,"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this ""perfect"" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her ""lover's"" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."
2,"1984 has come and left, some may say that this book has lost its importance after the collapse of communism. I think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate. The important point about 1984 is that if you don't pay attention 1984 can always become a reality. Need to listen to some of the people running for the top spot in this country and you can see them building their own ministry of truth.R HemingwayPast Twilight"
1,"When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."
1,"Despite the relatively low heel, this cute little number is uncomfortable for walking more than a few feet. Fine for sitting down and looking nice."
2,"A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time."
1,"Well, it depends what you want. If that is another cute fantasy film with Disney-esque animals and wise-cracking, snogging, contemporary teenagers (""Sorted!""), plus some soft-cheesy music at the end, then this is your movie. If you want something that Lewis might have regarded without horror and despair, this isn't it."
1,"if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
1,"This is the worst hunk of doo-doo ever committed to film. How can a director go from something as brilliant as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" to this?If you feel like wasting 2 hours of your life on something completely boring and irrelevant for the sake of ""art"", then by all means watch this abomination and feel ""enlightened"".This is the worst example of cinematic masturbation I've ever sat through."
1,"There is very little to recommend this album to anyone other than a true die-hard Queen fan. It is laborous and disconnected. The ""hits"" that came from it are good but not plentiful enough to justify the completed work"
2,"This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.Works great before my surf sessions. I just hope to be able to do the poses all the way soon. It's a great way to start my day."
2,"Had never heard of the guy - got it at a bookstore because it had 1200 pages (I needed a lot to read) and because it was written by an old guy (well, he's old now, at least - well- wrinkled but kind looking). So far I'm about a third of the way through it, but like everyone else has said, this book is great. Some writers get lazy and write the same story over and over. Not this guy - every character, every situation is unique. For people who like movies, read the one about Istafan and compare it to ""Lost in Translation"". The story about the swingers party is indescribably great also, just in the way he describes a man kissing a woman's hair or them barely dancing at all."
1,"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer."
1,"Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this ""upgraded"" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one."
2,Works very well and at a very reasonable price. It is built a lot stouter than the Apple power supply it repaces and at less than half the cost. You might miss the light on the plug but it work fine witout it. I doubt that the light is worth an extra $50.00.
1,"This is the third calculus book I've had, and the only one I haven't understood. In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions. I imagine if one had a good calculus teacher this would be less of a problem.Basically this book taught me nothing more than to hate calculus."
2,"I originally purchased the Metric edition, Celsius 232.778. I was thoroughly disappointed. Reading the original was a breath of fresh air, even if it wasn't as renown by the International Organization for Standardization."
1,"Summer Jams are memorable- just think of ""Hollaback Girl"" by Gwen Stefani and ""Oh"" by Ciara. This song by Cassie is TOTALLY forgettable. When I first heard ""Me & U"" I thought it was just okay. But after hearing 2, 3, 4,. . ., nth times, I decided that this song was weak. The music sounds like it is looped and Cassie sings like she's half asleep. There is no emotion or intensity in this song at all. NONE. It's just bland and dreary. But I guess it's just a sample of what's more to come on her upcoming album. Anywho, this song has already been forgotten like a bowl of Ramen Noodles with hot sauce when checks come out."
2,"Clay Aiken is indeed America's Idol, regardless of the outcome of the American Idol TV show. Everybody knows CLAY AIKEN actually won the competition, and his records sales, fan base, and popularity prove it. Clay Aiken is extremely talented and has proven that he is able to do a whole lot more in the entertainment industry and education industry than the other Idol contestants combined. Clay Aiken's amazing and incredible voice shines on this magnificent CD. The songs are very entertaining and exciting to hear. I am a music major, and I believe that the great songs on this CD and Clay Aiken's spectacular voice make this CD the best CD by a debut artist ever. CLAY AIKEN is the ultimate Idol and ultimate singer and ultimate entertainer and so much more. Idol Found..Game Over"
2,It's great to be able to order diapers online. Plus it is much cheaper than going to your local store. I love amazon.
1,"IT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WASIT DOSE FIT THE CAMRA BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD A USB END ALSO , SO THAT I COULD HOOK TO MY COMPUTER"
1,"I can't even begin to count the number of times I have been nursing my baby in the middle of the night and he has wet through his Pampers Dry diaper and it has gone all over me!!! These diapers are horrendous!!!! The only reason I used them last night was because I ran out of Huggies Overnites. I will never use them again!!!! I have been up since 4:15 because after I had to change my son's diaper and my clothes - he is now wide awake!!! Come up with a better night time diaper, Pampers!!! I'm going to the store to buy more Huggies as soon as my husband wakes up!!!!"
2,"I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
2,This is an amazing set of blocks. My 2 yr. old absolutely loves them and these magnetic blocks are very easy to use. Its a great toy for toddlers and preschoolers. Just add a few of the vehicles to it and you have days of imaginative fun ahead. My kids have not stopped playing with these since we bought them a few weeks ago.
2,"Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else.It bolted up almost perfectly, had to pull one corner slightly to line up with the mounting hole, but this was not hard to solve.Packaging was a little scanty for a heavy product, but again, for the low price it came in great condition, just a few scratches because the box was broken in a few places. But this product is going under my car, not to be seen and polished.Very good value, I would recomend this to anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive hitch receiver."
2,who ever buys this just a warning if left out more than 3 hours it will melt and burn what ever its on
1,"This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."
2,"Ramsay Sinclair and Brodick Buchanon, make a reappearance in this new novel as the heroes. Both now Lairds, they must discover who plots to harm Ramsay's young brother. In the process they meet two remarkable women who disrupt their lives and teach them about love. Fun to read, with a lot of action, adventure and ludicrous dialogue between these feisty women and their oh-so-stubborn suitors, this book keeps you turning the pages. However...Aside from the fact that all of the characters fall in love too quickly for me to keep track of, this book was a great read with the exception of the weak ending. Ms. Garwood, made the women appear both weak and weepy, when those words are a far cry from their indomitable characters. A better attempt could have been made to keep the characters true to form."
1,"This is not a condemnation of Initial D 4th Stage which is awesome. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD's are 16:9 and they're not, they're 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player."
2,"I received my zen garden yesterday, I really like it. For the price it is great quality. Also mine did not fall apart out of the box as others were saying. I was impressed with the packaging. For under $14 this is a great value. It is sitting on my desk at my office now."
2,"I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."
1,"These chisels are not sharp out of the box. My skew chisel was chipped and I see from other reviews there have been more than one chipped. As another review said, I cannot sharpen the carbide tips, so I have a new set of chisels that are not as useful as my old ones that I can sharpen. Don't waste your money on these chisels."
1,"We've used Pampers diapers since our 7 month old was born. Once our son turned 6 months old, the diapers no longer came close to providing the absorption needed to keep him dry through the night. Without diaper issues, he is sleeping through the night. However, the diapers begin to leak around 2am and by the morning both he and his crib are saturated. The ""Dry Max"" technology is nothing more than a marketing gimic. It clearly doesn't work and provides even less absorption capacity than the previous formulation. Save yourself the headache and buy a different brand."
2,If your looking for music that is true to life and chills u out on a sunny sfternoon then buy this cd...beautiful voice!
1,"I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4. The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky."
2,"I have a 100 lb lab- australian shepherd mix. When we are out walking he tends to forget that I exist whenever he sees a new dog, and he is strong enough to pull me over. I have tried several different approaches, including a choke chain, without a lot of success.The halti has worked better than anything else I have tried. He has been able to remove it a couple of times, but since it ended up around his neck, he was not able to get away from me."
1,"I rated this one star because the cds are stratched and they skipped all through the story. I would have sent it back, but I was so sure I could depend on this company. I threw away the returned information. I will have to purchase another CD before I use the novel with another class.I am very disappointed and I will think twice before I order again.Thank you for the opportunity to share.Gloria Gilliard"
2,"The Halo franchise has always been one to impress me. From the moment I started reading The Flood, I was able to immediately remember the exact scenes described in the book from the video game. There are many nice additions, however. As a fan of the Halo series, I highly recommend the books because they fill in a lot of holes that the campaign of Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo: Reach never address.To the casual reader not particularly involved in the Halo universe, these books are probably not for you."
1,"I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
2,"This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!"
2,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made Padre Pio very real, his life, dedication and suffering. It was a lengthy film but worth ever minute. I highly recommend it to any one at all intersted in the mystical side of our saints and the Church."
2,I bought this movie for my son and daughter and not only did they love it but I found myself watching and enjoying this movie as well. Very good movie for kids who love sponge bob. I definitely recommend to others.
2,"I received this record as a gift and have listened to it over and over with my friends at school. Many of the items are great for kids, but my friends and I love the psychedelic music and sound effects. My current favorite is ""Army Ants in Your Pants""...very imaginative!"
2,"If you like Five Star, get this reissue. It's nicely packaged and the sound quality is definitely an improvement from the original cd issue. The bonus tracks are not really rare though. Even in America, they are easy to find. What's missing is the a 12inch remix of Let Me Be the One. It's called the 'dance remix' and was on some 12-inch's with the Philadelphia remix, depending on which catalog number was on the picture sleeve. Anyways, it's a slamming remix that mixed All Fall Down in the intro and includes scratching, sampling, and a different sax solo. That version would have made this reissue a MUST BUY!"
1,The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
2,"Its evident after hearing the first few tracks that this is one man that will have a long lasting pop career. Think Barry Manilow (who Clay somewhat resembles) and Neil Diamond (sorry kids if you haven't heard of these guys ask your parents)Clay sings from the heart and you FEEL his music as you are listening to it. He may have been ripped off of the American Idol title, but he now has a certified NUMBER ONE in this CD which will be a huge seller. Eat your FAT heart out Ruben! In 6 months you will be all but forgotten. CLAY gets an A+++ for this work!"
1,"This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such. I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel. This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares. This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick. The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable. I'm sorry I wasted my time."
1,"you have to use two hands, because the jaws do not open far enough to get the wire in it."
1,"Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called ""Clay nation"" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"
2,"The authors do an excellent job of bringing together the essential information without overwhelming the reader. The book has many features which help the student bring the information together--outlines, study tables, and excellent review exercises. I highly recommend this book to any teacher or student teaching or taking a psychology class in tests and measurements."
1,"I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
2,"One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of ""whaat!"" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!"
1,"I had always been a loyal customer for pampers products. My son is now 11 months old and except for the first month, I had always used only pampers diapers and wipes. I have used these products in India and the quality was much better. I came to USA last month and since I had always used pampers, I went for pampers diapers again.To my dismay, the quality is so low but I thought that it would atleast work well. I have noted that it doesn't last for more than 5 hours. I put the diaper on at 830PM in the night and must change it at around 2 AM in the morning. One day night I didn't change his diaper at 2 and I woke up at 3AM when my son woke up crying, I was so shocked to see the diaper gel lying all over the bed. The bed and the comforter was all covered with the gel that came out.I feel that pampers should atleast consider the health of babies and make sure that their products are upto the standards."
1,"I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
2,What a couple of great old movies. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are always great together. Good music and dancing.
1,"Agree with NY red, skip it. Half the book is personal ""Deep Thoughts"" and the other half stuff about red hair you could already read on the web for free."
2,"Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"
2,Baby Dry is the ONLY diaper I'll EVER use. I have tried every other kind of diaper (new mom) and I am sticking with baby dry forever. I have NEVER had a leak with these diapers- my son is over a year now. They also don't smell like urine when wet. This diaper is highly reccommended and I would suggest people to not even bother trying anything else because you WILL wind up realizing that nothing compares to baby dry! Take it from me! www.facebook.com/dealmom
1,"I really can't believe how ""melodic"" (wussy) this cd was. I waited anxiously to buy it and when i did, i was so disapointed at the way SOAD changed. If the only song you liked off their first cd was ""Spiders"", then you will love this cd. If you preferred the real hard core metal sounds of SOAD, then I'm afraid you'll be sorry if you buy it. I hope their next cd sounds more like the first than this ... sequel."
2,Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
2,This is one of my Favorite Animes. I had a copy before I bought this one. I got rid of it to make more room on my movie shelf.
1,"Of all the DVDs that I have purchased through Amazon, I have neverhad any difficulty before. Upon receiving this DVD, I put it asidewithout checking it -- it was so nicely packaged. Upon receiving arequest from Amazon to review the purchase, the DVD was unwrapped,but it would not play on my machine, showing an ERROR message.The vendor had sent me (in Norfolk, VA) a Region 2 copy (forEurope, Asia, etc.). Yes, when I went back to the listing on Amazon,it did specify ""Region 2"", but that would have meant nothing to me,even if I had noted it.I give a 1 Star rating because the system will not accept a 0 Star,and I guess the nice packing deserves 1 Star.The vendor takes no responsibility for the goof-up, and it has costme more ($5.00 for Priority Mail) to return the DVD in order to get apartial refund. Am I happy? Heck no!"
1,"The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
1,"I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well."
1,"My son has been using Pamper Cruiser and never had problem. So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"
1,"I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money."
1,"If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing."
1,Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. It failed even the assembly test - the thing is so badly manufactured that the connection to which the pressure hose connects on the body of the washer was completely misaligned. There was no way I could connect the nozzle. OK - I thought it happens. I tried to call their 1-800-521-8559 support number and was on hold for 42 Minutes both on the Customer Service and Sales lines and then they cut me off. I did not even talk to a human! Their website is a joke. This is a typical bottom of the barrel Chinese company trying to dump poorly built stuff on the consumer. DO NOT BUY this and encourage such companies that dont give a hoot about the customer.I'm returning this and telling every retailer to dump this.AM
1,"For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable."
1,"I recieved the product in a timley manner but when i played the discs they skipped and there was distortion on the screen, mixed up pixels. Im not sure if it was the DVDs or my DVD player although the rest of my DVDs play ok.."
1,I could not watch this movie all the way to the end. I found the acting to be sub-par especially the American actor. I was hoping the scenery of old England would hold me through the movie but the scenery wasn't even good. The Sherlock Holmes series that aired on television was better than this DVD. Perhaps I can give my DVD as a gift to a non movie buff.
1,"I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading ""The Partner"", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."
1,"I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."
2,"There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."
2,"ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
1,"This movie is UNACCURATE! Stupid! Foolish! Laughable! Not like the games! How? Here's a list of what was bad about this so-called ""movie"":*The Goombas are tiny brown mushroom-like enemies not dinosaurs!*King Koopa is human!*The Mario Bros. do not live in Brooklyn in the games!!*Bowser (King Koopa) has a wife*In the games there IS no Dinosaurcity! It's the Mushroom Kingdom*Toad is not in this movie (dumb)*Yoshi was more cartoony and can talk in the games*More than HALF of the enemy characters are missing in this movieAND MANY MORE!But don't panic you'll get a good chuckle from the EXTREME bad acting! Seriously even Nintendo hated this movie!Overall: Is Super Mario Bros. bad? Of course not! It's not a bad game! It's just a bad movie. (...) If you want a splendid adventure then stick with the games."
2,"I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video."
1,"How nice. Tess is a totally unrealistic character-she has more sorrow in her life then most of us have in a century. This book is extremely sad, and I don't understand why it's a classic. Tess is very happy until her alchoholic dad discovers that they were a noble family, so, getting to big for his britches, he sends Tess over to another D'urberville family, which actually just adopted the name because they wanted to seem influential. That's when the trouble starts. Soon, Tess gives birth to a baby, and goes back home in disgrace. Then she meets another nice guy, who abandons her when he learns of her past. They author could have done with some happpy scenes...life's not all sadness!"
1,"This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals."
2,"I haven't tried the DVD yet so no feedback on that, but I really like the ball itself.Being my first stability ball, I was a little worried about it being able to hold me (a BIG girl at 5'8"" & approx. 260 lbs), but it does, and I can already feel/see the difference.It was easy fill, and has lost very little pressure over a couple of weeks worth of daily use. It lost enough to open up & pump back up, but nothing like some of the horror stories below.The color wasn't as shown, which was fine with me - not trying to color coordinate my excercise equipment or anything . . ."
1,"I have no idea how I was talked into watching this movie. I totally believe this was a waste of good film-and a lot of it. A young Daniel Day Lewis with a hipper Fonz impersonation and a whiney Juliette Binoche. Only Lena Olin was worth watching, but not for any depth or anything. This film actually made a communist invasion dull. I absolutely didn't care for this couple. Below par acting, horrible direction, terrible editing, annoying soundtrack and dialogue so bad I think someone should take away the screenwriter's guild card. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,"I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."
1,"I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, ""ufo"" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."
1,"This book is falsified and exaggerated. The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published. The Voodoo's also were trying to scare ""outsiders"" who criticized them away with wild, false stories. Don't believe everything you read in this book. It's a hoax."
1,"Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points. I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says ""Elbow"" and not this sport version."
1,This is a light weight film with a heavy weight star. The film is not worthy of the great Paul Muni.
1,"As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
2,From begining to end a perfect example of the art and skill of Mr. Lewis. Unlike any other of his books. Yet just as wonderful.
2,I loved this movie as a kid and still enjoy it. With the remastered deluxe edition the color is great.
2,"I thought Clay's single was good, but this is the best cd ever! Ofcourse I am and always have been a huge Clay fan, ever since i first saw him, but this cd blew me away! I love Clay Aiken!"
2,"I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information."
1,This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
1,i wouldnt trust the company it never got to my house i thnik the mail man stole it from me!
1,I was disappointed in this book--too European for my taste. I expected more from her. I'll give it to Goodwill or such.
2,"Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing."
2,"This is a GREAT CD for Clay Aiken, the best tracks on this CD are Track 1 Invisible and Track 6 Run to me. I think he will have number one hits with both. The whole CD is great and it shows Clays talent and his versatility as an artist, they really did a good job with this one, Clay I Love Ya!!!!"
2,"I'M A BIG FAN OF R. KELLY AND HIS MUSIC. THIS IS PROBABLY HIS BEST ALBUM. THERE ARE A LOT OF HATERS OUT THERE THAT JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TALENTED THIS MAN REALLY IS. IN MY OPINION HE IS THE TIGHTEST R@B ARTIST IN THE MUSIC WORLD. TO MR. KELLY...I'VE WORN THIS CD OUT ALREADY, SO I'M LOOKING FOWARD TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL COME OUT WITH NEXT. TO ALL OF THE FANS OUT THERE WHO LIKE GOOD, QUALITY, R@B MUSIC, THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST BUY!!!!!!"
2,"This is a really fun toy for kids when traveling. Both of my kids (10 & 13) had fun playing with it, and I recommended it to my parents who got one as well. It will keep kids amused for a good long time, and it makes them really think about a certain object. Good fun!"
2,The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them
2,I was troubled over what to get my son for Christmas this year but when I came across this jigsaw I knew my search had come to an end. This jigsaw will help him cope with the stresses of being a modern day 4 year old surrounded by electronic stimuli 24-7. You can't go wrong with Melissa & Doug!
1,Ready for the THIRD SECRET? . . . . wait for it . . . . SPOILER ALERT!!!!here it is--GOD IS SICK OF THE CHURCH'S OPPOSITION TO HOMOSEXUALITY AND ABORTION (Among other things).
1,"The Third Secret is a very good story; unfortunately its written in a mediocre manner. The plot is shallow and poorly developed and at times, obvious. Its more akin to the work of an amateur than a published author. Although Berry seems to have stumbled while penning this work, the editor has badly let the reader down; errors in prose, style and consistency are too numerous to mention.I suggest those who wish to read Berry's work wait for the paperback edition or visit their public library. The Third Secret is a poor waste of hard earned wages."
2,"I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day."
1,"All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery."
1,"I dont even know what to say about this flim, all I can say is that it's very dumb and it really pissed be off cuz IM a huge Kurt Cobain fan......But it is kind of funny but yet so depressing... But yah if your the type of person who likes to watch movies that has no talking hardly n' luv watchin people just walk around then Hey you should really like this flim"
2,"The ""experts"" always!! This movie is enjoyable,the air battle scenes are very well done,story well told,it is for planes lovers not for history or movie ""experts"",the dogfights are fantastic!!I RECOMMEND for any plane Lover!!For the History ""experts"",Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, formerly the Marquis de La Fayette (or Lafayette) (September 6, 1757-May 20, 1834) was a former French aristocrat and military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions.He permanently renounced the title ""Marquis"" before the French National Assembly in June, 1790.)Lafayette served in the American War of Independence both as a general and as a diplomat, serving entirely without pay in both roles.Movies are for Entertainment!!I highly recommend this movie."
2,"I've read the book and found not only fun in it, but also deepness and complex political explanations. It is not only propaganda against communism, cause as everybody knows Orwell, in fact, liked communism ideals. It shows how individualism is smashed in a totalitarian society. I also recomend the animation movie AntZ. As many have seen it is not meant for kids..."
2,"We got this book from the library and ever since my daughter read it for the first time she has been talking about Squeegy Bugs continually. The illustrations are wonderful, and the story is very simple and nice (and my daughter said to add this...""cats!"" In other words, the only thing that this book is missing for my young daughter is cats. Also check out the website for the publisher. It is fabulous. It has a fun couple of games based on the book. Very nicely done."
1,"You get what you pay for. I have used these batteries as back up for the original Canon one. After 10 months with only occasional use, battery won''t take or hold a charge. Do you self a favor, and buy a Canon battery. You'll save money in the long run."
1,Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.One star.
2,"Rick Astley was never given the credit he deserved, he was certainly one of the better dance-pop artists to come out of the 80's. He was also very versatile - just listen to his version of ""When I Fall In Love"", a great cover version. He was certainly a blue-eyed soul singer, I think he rates right up there with Michael McDonald, who he even reminds me of, some. This disc showcases his best and best-loved songs. Highly recommended."
1,"Any problem listed in previous reviews, I encountered with mine. At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer."
1,"Invisible is the only song on this cd that is any good,my wife loves Clay,but I always tell her he won`t be around long and neither will American Idol.as far as easy listening goes it is pleasing enough but don`t look for any rock n roll here."
2,"This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature."
1,As a student of jiujitsu i understood alot of the moves but i found that without previous knowledge these pictures and instructions were difficult to understand. I feel there is alot of good information but not worth buying.
2,"Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future."
1,i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard
1,"The character development was poor and insufficient, almost like the author tried to disguise the identity of them. As far as what was there, it was accurate, from my experience with people suffering from a bi-polar disorder but I wouldn't look here for any great insights. Worth a read if you don't have anything else handy because it is a fast read, but I've read short stories that were better thought out."
2,Austin brings to life a part of the gospel many wish to skip over. The horror of idolatry is described in ways many refuse to visualize because of the horror that is involved. This is a wonderful portrayal of this dark time in Israel's history and the beginning of the glorious rising out of the darkness of sin.
2,"I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the ""Extra firm compression"". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!"
1,"So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
1,"I purchased this slot machine thinking it was larger than it was and also hoping it would at least perform a little better than it did. It doesn't even require a coin to release the jackpot. Overall, this machine is not worth purchasing."
1,"I was so disappointed when I ordered this from Amazon! I hate widescreen and having the picture cut so I specifically ordered this so I can get FULL SCREEN! I opened the movie which said Full Screen on the front, only to find out the DVD inside was really WIDESCREEN! How could Amazon do that!? I wonder if they're just reselling movies. Very careless on their part and I would return it except I already threw the receipt away because I had assumed Amazon would get it right. Don't think I'll use Amazon again."
2,Overall A Royal Kiss was pretty good. It shows you how anormal girl can meet the boy of her dreams. Although that is a greatconcept I think the book was a little too predictable in showing this. Its shows you the ups and downs of relationships and always keeps you interested. I think this book would be very good for summer reading and I hope you enjoy the book!
1,"I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!"
2,"Wow, I just bought this CD and I was surprised to see how poorly reviewed it was. Actually, that is the primary reason for my participation in this review... to offer a positive and encouraging reason to purchase this compact disc. I found the music to be refreshing and beautiful and, despite what other reviews have said, found the musicians to be quite talented. It's a good CD to relax to, have a dinner party to, et cetera. It's not REM, don't expect to hear REM. It is, however, a string quartet who brings a refreshing twist to most of REM's popular songs."
1,"It's been a number of years since I read this short work for my Pre-1900s British Novels class as an undergraduate, and while my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, my general impression of dislike and boredom is crystal clear. While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways. While Yorick is the driving force, he lacked that depth.We followed it up with Evelina by Burney, which was far more enjoyable."
2,"CANDIDE IS ONE THE BEST LOVE STORIES OF ALL TIMES. THE BOOK MADE ME LAUGH, CRY, HATE, BUT MOST ALL LOVE AND SEE THAT TRUE LOVE WILL ALWAYS FIND IT TRUE END.

BUT ALAS CANDIDE CHOSEN COURSE WAS TO LEAVE THIS PLACE OF PERFECT PEACE AND UNITY AND TO SEEK FOREVER HIS TRUE PEACE AND UNITY, HIS BELOVED MADAME CONGONDE.THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK SHORT AND SWEET I RATE THIS BOOK A TRUE CLASSICHENRY"
1,"There are very few books, no matter how poor, that I have been unable or unwilling to finish, but this was one of them. I had to force myself to keep reading until finally, I just had to give up. I thought the writing style was pedestrian and there was just way too much of it. And yet there was no suspense and the pace was so slow, it drove me nuts. I totally disagree with reviewers who claim Lindsey writes good prose. There are so many who are better in this genre. Try John Connolly, Dennis Lehane, Carol O'Connell. I'm sure there are plenty more who can write circles around this guy. (Just to be fair, and as a favor to a friend, I'm giving Lindsey another chance and am halfway through his ""Animosity"". It's a totally different style, but unfortunately, no less boring. Ho hum!)"
2,"The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other."
1,"The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."
2,"This literate city follows with enthusiasm, the entropy and self contained decline within all things John E. Douglas.Today we publically celebrate Amazon.coms 20th anniversary, with John nowhere to be found. Sadly at Barnes & Noble, among the bottom feeders he begs. Upon a low traffic floor shelf, squeezed between his FBI founders favorite pastime, and Mother Natures firm hand, a fossil record of John Douglas."
2,"BATMAN BEGINS suceeds on almost all levels. The acting is wonderfully perfect. The special effects are seamless. The scipt is pretty darn good. Even better than the originals, BATMAN BEGINS revives the story of our beloved caped (or winged) crusader from the very beginning, when his parents are killed. It goes from there to a wonderful semi cliff-hanger that leaves you eaglerly awaiting a sequel (due out in theaters July 18, 2008).Great acting and script. Seeing the marvelous Bale in the Batman suit is truly a thrill. On a Batman scale alone, this would've been a 5. But, to be honest, though it's great, it's not as good as Spider-man or Iron Man. That's the reason for the deducted star. Highly recommended."
2,"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. ""Open"" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."
1,The service from American Athletics is poor. The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size. Won't be shopping there again.
1,"I ordered this book because of the good reviews, expecting a great book full of spells.There aren't many spells however, like the cover implies. Instead the author gives his knowledge of herbs, incenses and oils and what each can be used for.Spoken and Written spells seems to give a few spells worth trying, but overall, if you're looking for an actual ""spell book"", this isn't the one unless you like to go herb/incense/oil hunting.I returned the book the next day."
1,"I bought this hoping to use it with my archos 630 video player. Sadly it doesn't even add more than 30 mins of playback time. Its made for less demanding electronics like phones, pda's etc... I wouldn't use this for portable dvd players or video players. Its rated draw power is about 350 mah."
1,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking."
1,"This side story is actually an anthology of semi related tales. It is tedious, boring and an absolute mess. Unless you have a passion for the minutiea of 17th century German government this is a waste of time. I have enjoyed the other books very much but this one is so disjointed that it barely makes sense.I would suggest skipping this one and waiting for the ""real"" book to come about the Baltic War."
1,"I purchased this at really low price off ebay thinking I would give GPS a try. This thing drains the Visors batteries, and never, ever, ever locked onto a single satellite, and often was not even recognized by the PDA. The UBigo mapping software is still available, but none of the maps are downloadable because you have to register the device, and the net site is defunct. Pure Krap with a capital K."
2,I loved this book - Didn't want it to end! A definite must-read for fans of historical fiction and suspense.
2,"What an excellent story with a villain who is anything but a flat character. Thanos has a lust for power, but he finds out that it's perks come with a price. Below death's affections now above them, Thanos revels in his own might. With power comes pride, and it is his downfall. But is losing ultimate power and ultimate responsibility really such a bad thing?"
2,"Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping."
2,"The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . ."
1,"Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for."
2,"I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."
2,"In an effort to get ahold of this c.d. last fall when it was originally scheduled to appear in a music store near me, I contact the J's themselves for more information. They hinted that I could find most (if not all) of the c.d. online. I did. I love this c.d. When you start off with a bass-bumping, beat-pumping song like ""Horns of Destruction,"" you would expect it to set the tempo for the rest of the tracks. But, now you must keep in mind that you are listening to the 2 Skinnee J's: everything you know is wrong. Moving from ""H.O.D"" to more mellow songs like a fairly Cars-esque ""Secret Frequency"" and ""Sugar and Candy;"" the J's have yet again proven themselves as music wizards. The more you listen, the more apparent that becomes. Of course, the J's are not for everyone. If you should get the chance to see them live, you may become a strict Skinnee Soldier. Listening to this album alone does not do it justice. Listen in groups, listen responsibly, and as always, listen loudly."
1,"Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it."
2,"Daniel's got some tight lyrics and some nice production on this CD, it's definitely worth buying, it'll be in your rotation for weeks!"
1,"While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."
2,"This is C-Murders best album, and a classic. With no production credits to beats by the pound, Deadly soundz did great. Althouh Kenoe and his traitor self, did a couple of good songs. I think this album shows good steady down south music. This album proves that he is the best rapper in the no limit camp. It is a great CD."
2,"This item is excellent for the first layer of protection for your video iPod. As the description says, this is not a sticker with adhesive on it, but a ""static cling polymer plastic"", which is very easy to put on and reposition.The front cover covers the click wheel and most of the face, leaving very little open to scratches. The back cover covers most of the flat section, but doesn't extend to the curved section. Mine is going inside of a Speck Products iPod Video ToughSkin, so no worries there.On a side note, beware of the ""More Buying Choices"" sellers who are offering the ""same"" product at $0.01. I purchased one of these first and got a similar, but much inferior product. It had the same dimensions as the Powersupport product, but it was a sticker and was very hard to apply. It was very prone to have air bubbles that I couldn't rub out. Do not buy the $0.01 product and expect to get the Powersupport XA-01 Crystal Film.Enjoy your well-protected iPod."
1,"Well, we saw this garbage on opening day. I took my 5-year-old who loves the Spongebob cartoon. It seemed like it was nearly completely devoid of humor. Don't understand how most of the ""reviewers"" on this site reviewed the film BEFORE they've seen it. As a Spongebob fan, I'm very disappointed. This is one I won't be buying when it goes to video. Flat plot, drawn-out story and it seemed like it would never end. Even the truly funny bits (I counted about 4) didn't make up for the boredom we suffered. Save your $!"
1,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover.
2,"most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album"
2,I ordered this from Amazon and with regular shipping and received the product 2 days later. I bought it due to a recommendation from our pediatrician and it does work. You must use it daily and we have not been as vigilant as we should.
2,I loved all eight films on this DVD. All of the stories were great and the actors did a wonderful job.
1,"I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
2,"what can i said , i just love them , They got flexy wings almost like Cruisers. the price is good you pay no tax buying online , and you get it in two day right iny your door. yes , i mean two days ."
1,"This is bad. Not even music. All it is, is a bunch of guys yelling at the top of their lungs talking about sniffing drugs and about killing people. I was open enough to listen to this whole CD. Not for me."
2,This book is great and the 4 agreements are inspirational and thought provoking. We spend so much time not respecting ourselves and others and this book takes us to a place to see what is really important. I loved the book so much I bought the CD to listen to in my car and Ipod.
2,"but seriously,i laughed so hard watching this movie, that stuff came flyin outta my nose. It's wayyyy better than Sandler's last 4 projects, which really weren't that funny. Well, okay, mr. deeds was kinda funny....anything with steve buschemi....i digress.if you're a first timer and you're expecting some serious dramatic moments, then good news, there's a walrus in the movie which plays the part to perfection.on the whole, really funny, good ending...kinda bittersweet, okay i cried - so sue me!what's the movie about? good question.let's see if i can answer that in a few sentences...pineapple, amnesia, beach boys and a walrus :D"
2,"Pampers baby dry is great! My husband and I absolutely love it. It's very absorbant. Once we forgort to change the diager for our son, though the diaper is very heavy, it's not leaky at all. I think we will stick with pampers baby dry."
1,"I had to read this for school, and it was hard for me to look at it. There is no action, no humor, no excitement whatsoever. There is a lot of detail, but that is only on one person. All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa. So bitter, bland and boring."
2,"I liked the book Castle In The Attic because it was a book on a Dragon and a Knight. My three favorite parts were when William climbed the tree and got the apple for the cursed man. My other one was when he fought the dragon,and my last one was when William fought Alastor.Other kids should read this book so they will be more interested in reading the sequel Battle For The Castle."
2,I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. These are not the best but they certainly are good enough. They are a bit thin but soft and warm. I do recommend them.
1,"I have had this printer for about three months and have consistently had the same problems with the printer telling me that it is out of paper when I am looking at a stack of paper. Sometimes it works, more often it does not. It is very inconsistent.Now I have a new issue. The scanner, which is very good, has stopped working. When I press the scan button, my printer says, ""No Scan Options"" which is fantasticAlso, I tried to use some specialty paper (namely iron on paper) in this machine and it was a complete mess. For what I paid, this should not be happening. I thought HP made a good machine, but I will NEVER buy a HP printer again."
1,"It was one of the worst dvd's that I have seen. The sound was not synchronized with the video, the picture quality was poor. I was very disappointed with the people that transferred it over from VHS. I returned it and was credited. This particular dvd should never have been offered for sale..."
2,"The Odyssey was about the greek hero Odysseus' journey home from his victory of the trojan war. He encounters many perils on his voyage. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FANTASY , THIS IS YOUR MOVIE."
2,"I purchased the Mug Warmer as a Christmas gift for a relative. Within a few days after opening the gift, I got a phone call raving about how fantastic and useful this item is. Good idea, and oh so practical."
1,"Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His ""so-called"" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"
1,"Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew"
1,"I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy."
2,"Of course, it is just another white shirt--but a great one for the price, and my husband loved it."
2,"I just got this cd a few days ago and I must say it is pretty good. I haven't listened to all of the songs yet but i am sure they are awesome. This was an ingenious idea to put together the best of Sweat and Suit. It has a little bit of both and at fist i wanted to get get sweat, but i waited, and i am glad because i found this cd."
2,"This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be ""Special"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". ""When I Grow Up"" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"
1,"I bought this coffee pot for my mom for Christmas because she has one just like it from the 80's but it looks awful, this is the 2nd mr coffee 4 cup pot that I bought for her and they both don't heat water hot enough to brew the coffee, the coffee always turns out weak tasting, she tried using a dark roast and still no flavor, never will I buy me coffee again"
1,"I don't like it, feels like paper. i buoght this item because it of the price it was on.Ima throw them in a couple of month. Make my money worth."
2,These are spares for the wristrocket I bought my daughter so the have not been tested but they seam fine.
2,"This book was a wellspring of information for me as a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic. Getting off the cycle of being told to eat complex carbs, seeing my blood glucose spike from doing just what I was told, and getting medications increased again and again, I read what Dr. Bernstein said with interest. After trying his recommendations I can say with no reservations that this book may have saved my life! I highly recommend it to anyone who has pre-diabetes or diabetes and hope that the general medical community opens their eyes. After only one day of this diet my blood glucose readings were close to normal, and continue to stay there, with less medication. My energy levels are high and I have felt better than I have in a long long time. Kudos to you Dr. Bernstein, for daring to say the truth! I recommend both his books and also Dr. Atkins Diabetes Revolution to anyone who wants to learn about diabetes and diet."
2,"I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book."
1,I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
2,"This novel involves mythology, yet again. Zelazny really liked writing about that stuff, it is not very hard to spot that.A group of highly evolved and powerful posthumans on a planet, are viewed as gods by the other, standard human type denizens.Being gods, of course there are conflicts, petty squabbles, one-upsmanship and trickery.The mythology in question is Hindu, this time."
1,"I really was dissapointed with this book.I thought I'd learn some ""insider secrets"" as Corey Rudl says in the title, but it only deals with general knowledge! This book is a compilation of some useless ""free reports"" that you can find anywhere on the internet...for free.Eric"
2,Amazing book. I've never read one like it. Quite interesting. Honest experiences. An eye-opener. Anyone interested in history will enjoy this. I am.
1,"Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this. And if you do, BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it."
1,"i had actually purchased this movie at my local target store and i can say you cant judge a movie by its cover, it may look all nice and fancy but there is only a total of 4 stooges episodes on the first dvd, the second dvd are all cartoons and the 3rd is all special features and exclusive interviews with the stooges families, children/grandchildren. extremely disapointed."
2,"We've tried Costco's diapers and to a limited extent, Huggies... From our experience, Baby Dry are the best at catching leaks and offer the most value."
1,"Okay, I made a HUGE mistake. I was at Best Buy (no on-line reviews...) and bought this CD based on the song list. Listen to the samples before you buy, you'll be convinced that YOU TOO, can be a ROCK STAR. I wouldn't buy an album that had me singing on it, but Kurt sounds weirdly like my own crooning in the first track. OOO, OWWW, MAKE HIM STOP...."
1,"I had to read this book for my English class at school and I started out with an optimistic attitude reflecting this book. The beginning of the book was rather slow but, of course, I had to read it and was willing to give it a chance on account of it being such an essential classic. As I read further, though, I feel that the book could have develloped further than it did. What had been a trace of a plot at the beginning of the book had all but shrunken into a totally unnecessary conclusion that, I feel, had no thought or reflection on the main goal of the book."
1,"I thought the Cd would be good after hearing Tubthumping and Amnesia but I was wrong..I feel that other than Tubthumping and Amnesia, there isn't anything about this Cd to boast about..."
2,"Childhood memories are some of the strongest sensory feelings anyone will ever have. When we were kids we knew how we felt, we just couldn't always determine why we felt that way and couldn't possibly put our complicated feelings into words.In ""Jim the Boy"" Tony Earley takes universal childhood emotions of pride, jealousy, greed and companionship and strikes up a story to rummage through his own memory of childhood complexes. It's been done before--""The Wonder Years"" TV show comes to mind--but Earley doesn't play for laughs here. Rather he takes a grown-up's understanding and experience of the world and latches it onto the illuminating eye of a child.Earley succeeds in creating a quick, nimble book that, even though it's set in 1924, could have happened yesterday."
1,I have bought baby dry diapers before and have been satisfied with it. But this time I ordered it from Amazon. The diapers tear when they are opened from prefolded packing. Sometimes I have even found that the gel or the stuff its made from has leaked. I am extremely dissapointed with this lot of diapers. Now on I'd rather buy it from a store than order oline so its easier to return.
2,"While this guide does not go indepth with each reptile and each terrarium type, it does provide all the information that you need as you look into setting up and maintaining a terrarium and selecting reptiles. The reptile information is broken down with easy to understand symbols and includes reptile characteristics, diet, behavior, times of day they are most active, level of difficulty for the reptile's care, terrarium size, type, substrate, temperature, and other habitat items that are needed to care for that reptile.This guide is well beyond the simple quick reference guide I was looking for!"
1,"First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse."
2,"I stumbled over this movie on a movie channel in a hotel in Bali, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, and I watched the whole thing.Crazy kung-fu story, over the top acting and more Matrix-like action sequences than you can shake a big stick at. The plot may be hard to follow, but if you want plot, watch Meryl Streep. This movie is about kicking ass, and believe me, everyones ass gets kicked. Different fighting styles satisfy the amateur kung-fu-ist, and the over the top wire movements make this seem more like a live action manga.If only the ladies in this film had agreed to nudity, it would get five stars. Oh, well....Seriously, one of the best in the genre."
2,"This passionate brief survey of American Literature contains much spontaneous flowing masterful and original writing. Lawrence famous 'Trust the teller not the tale' is the motto of the work. It argues that the true creative work takes on a life of its own that even its creator cannot completely define and control.Perhaps the most famous essay in this book is Lawrence's hatchet- job of Ben Franklin who he found to be a spiteful, penny- pinching, calculating dead soul. In fact old Ben could be in certain places as lively and probably more lively than Lawrence himself.What however is most important is that Lawrence in this work understands the great subterranean and mysterious genius of a kindred spirit for him, the literary creator of the Great White Whale."
2,Pete Seegar's Greatest hits.Very good. Brings back many memories of earlier days. If you have joan baez and pete seegar you have the best
2,"This is a very attractive edition of this book. The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."

2,"Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist. This novel impressed itself to the point that I met one of the characters in a dream, a truly disorienting experience. Sure, it's disjointed. Innoculation to the parasitic authority of the word virus, to see and feel in another medium, whaddaya think the poor guy's tryna say here, anyways?"
1,"I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man. Plus, to top it off, the book was boring!"
1,Some parts make no sense at all as you read through this book. In one sentence in the book Green says not to remove the fan leaves and three sentences later he says to remove them. This is very confusing and shows a lack of editing. Growing errors are littered in this book making it frustrating to read.
2,This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight. Words of warning for the present and future.
1,"Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)"
1,Tivo is a great product but this one was defective and I had to send it back and upgrade. Delivery was prompt and product was packed wll.
2,"It doesn't keep my drink very hot, but at least it doesn't get cold any more. I drink tea and it helps if the cup is put on the unit while it's hot initially."
1,"I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at ""art rock"" BORING"
2,"I love Pampers, they definitely do not last the 12 hours they say they will. I have to change my kids in the middle of the night sometimes because they wake up soaked. My one child just turned 1..and the other just turned 2. The diapers work A LOT better than other brands I have tried. I was a Luvs fan until they changed and they just weren't as good anymore :( so back to Pampers I went."
1,"Very bad condition didn't work even one time because was all screchet up all ower , the box was so dirty i had to put in garbage imediatly .I dont recomand anyone to buy ."
2,"This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare."
1,It seems the object of the writer was to see how much he could rewrite and still keep some connection to the original story. For example Blessed and Booth's characters were changed from father-daughter to husband-wife just so Lestrade would look foolish for arresting the husband for the wife's murder. Nothing in this film works so I gave it to charity. If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes get The Sign of Four.
1,"There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
1,"Everyone seems to have the same problem with this rice cooker. It just dies after 1-2 years. Ours is worthless now. Bought a simple one for $13, works just as well. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,"Felt cheap to the touch, very thin. AND THEY ARE SCENTED. I looked at the item posting AND the box and nowhere does it say scented. These arrived and they had a floral smell. I was not happy"
2,"I have the Philips HDRW720 and had identical TV Guide issues. I talked to the Philips people and the TV Guide people. It seems that the problem is with the cable companies. My company is Brighthouse (Time Warner) and they had compatability problems with the TV Guide program as recently as September 2005 here in Florida. At time there would be no data or missing data. I tried to record programs but there would be nothing because the cable company was not transmtting the data. It has improved 100% since I bought my recorder, still not perfect but almost there."
1,I was saddened to find out that Jennifer Love Hewitt was cast to portray Audrey Hepburn. She had no right to even try to compare to Hepburn. It is a poor excuse for a biography and it angered me to see Hepburn's life so poorly portrayed.
1,Was missing the belt for one thing was to small had to order another one just so she could use it they need to put the correct size on the item we ordered a 5-6 got ot and the item said fits size 4-5
2,"The imagery in this book is haunting and evocative. The struggle for dignity amid poverty is still poignant and relevant today. This book is a timeless classic. Read it for the first time, or read it again. You will be glad that you did."
2,"i must say this book initiated feelings i had not expected.i bought the book as a source of african american history butas i read further, i got drawn into the life of a kid from thelast vestiges of slavery who despite the obvious nefariousconditions for a black kid during those times, was allowed tofollow a dream of exploration by gaining and earning acceptancefrom those good people willing to ""give the guy a chance"".This book is much more than a story of a black kid who despitenever ending verbal attacks (many to this day)did what he wishedand contributed to humanity, it is a book that proves thereare no limits whenever humans are able to forget their minordifferences and intelligently solve any predicament.Kudos to Mr. Robinson!!!"
2,"These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
2,This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.
2,"This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son."
2,"This is not a review, it's a rave. This is not some piece of self-conscious, tricked out, contempo ironic (the knowing wink in the voice), cooler than thou vocabulary popcorn or breathy lil grrl prom panic whine. This is real music. The full range of expression. It will move you. Watch out."
1,"I love Pamper's Swaddlers. I've tried Huggies and both Pampers brands, and out of all of them Swaddlers are my favorite. That being said, the Baby Dry diapers are terrible. With Swaddlers you can adjust the fit, and the diapers are really soft. Baby Dry diapers feel like they're recycled and and I really dislike the sticky waist straps. They're shorter so you can't adjust the fit as easily, and the waist is always loose--with a boy that's a very bad idea because he tends to get his clothes wet through the TOP of the diaper instead of the sides now. I can't wait until we use these up because I will never buy Baby Dry again."
1,"I ordered this Futuro Stabilizing Knee Support because I wanted a beige colored one(I have a black McDavid knee brace and it did not come in beige), but I was a little disappointed with it. I don't get the support I get with my McDavid one. I will still use the Futuro, but not for walking for a long distance."
1,"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the ""secret"", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"
2,"This CD, being his first release, finds him experimenting a little trying to find his signature sound, which, for a long time Webb fan, is a welcome suprise. The CD is 100% Webb, but there are hints of other things here as well, and there is even a noticable Elvis influence in some places. It is in no way an attempt to copy Elvis, though. It is very subtile. Like they were influenced by the same music growing up. That's what I heard, at least.This remastered compilation also sounds great. Some of the best sounding recordings I have heard in a long time. The drums are noticably clear and great sounding.This CD completes my collection. I now own the complete works of Webb Wilder. This CD does not disappoint. It is excellent, and I have never heard a bad Webb Wilder CD. I think that I enjoy it more because it was the last one that I bought, and I can really appreciate the variation on this CD more than if I would have bought it first.He is also great live."
1,"A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history."
1,"I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested. Believe it or not, some women have higher sex drives than their man. If you're a man needing some help with your partner, this is a good read. For a woman needing help with her man -- keep looking -- this book is not for you."
2,"Felicia's journey is an excellent novel. The background to both characters is well developed. Mr. Hilditch in particular becomes more sinister due to his overwhelmingly ordinary appearance. The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp. There are few convent girls left in Ireland who show such naivety. However she does grow more likeable, but not enough to demonstrate why she should affect Mr. Hilditch so much."
2,"What an incredible collection of the Thin Man series. A total of six movies and a seventh was a bonus about the two stars, William Powell and Myra Loy. This was a gift and we were able to watch three of the movies before our house guest left after the holidays. I was sad to see the gift go, ha ha. No seriously, I highly recommend this set of The Thin Man series.."
1,"While he was filming another movie in Toronto, we went out and bought this horrible movie so we could get him to sign it. You know what he wrote? ""I Hate this Movie. Greg Kinnear"""
2,"Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem)."
1,"These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
1,"Too difficult to attach to my shoes...I prefer to tie my laces, even though I may have to do it more than once."
1,Cannot play. This was suppose to be a double3 feature. Only one movie plays. How can I get my money back?
2,"I plugged this unit in last night and to my amazement picked around 20 channels. I had to run to radioshack and switch the wimpy data cable it comes with. I bought an rg6 quad shielded cable , ideal for HD signals. After I swapped the cable the picture improved instantly. Add another $25 for the cable. I use the antenna in my house and I live 20 miles from the city center.I am using the RCA ATSC11 as my receiver."
1,If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
2,"Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."
2,"Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all. Corporal (now Captain) Carrot is the catalyst of the change in the Watch, hiring 3 new members. Lance-Constables Angua, Cuddy, and Detritus (the former splatter of the Mended Drum). With the ongoing gangfights with the dwarves and trolls, Detritus and Cuddy put aside their differences and, with the help of Carrot, recruit more members to solve the mystery of Discworld's first -and only- ""gonne""."
2,My 8 year old boy just loves his sword ( the black color and the design). The toy is plastic and very light and SAFE. My son has it for 3 weeks and it's still in good condition so far. Very pleased about the purchase.
1,"I'm usually a good judge of which books I'll love, but not this time. My friend warned me that Snow quickly disolves into psychobabble, but was worth reading for the cat antics. Right she was! Perhaps I didn't feel well the day I began reading this annoying book, but within the first 20 pages, I hated it. It was hard to finish, but I was intrigued with the unusual talents the cats displayed, and I kept hoping the story would become less uncomfortable to read. It just had no flow. The subject matter did not bother me, but the way it was written did. I hardly ever read a book I don't want to finish, but this one was a struggle. To the author's credit, I found Vinny and Sophie the cats very charming. Perhaps Ms. Howie's next book will be easier on the nerves."
2,"The first paragraph or so , it was like Mrs. Rinaldi you can do better but as I read on I was like I take that back. I totally fell into the Washington D.C. backdrop. If I had to recommend this book to a person I'd also tell them this: you can't stop at just one of her books."
1,This was typical of what happens when a talented young artist gives up ! The songs are all fluff with no substance. He just talks about getting some (Wow what a new concept) This was pure cookie cutter Music. Shame on you Kelly
2,It has made my life a lot easier since giving up on those remote phone jacks for me tivo connections. Now I dont have to make a connection every 5-7 days or at all unless there has been a real power outage or router difficulty.what a joy
1,These batteries last approx 1 hr which is the same recording time from the originals plus these are considerably larger
2,"We just got this book and again it is great. Diane Layton does a great job speaking to little ones about something so very serious and making it understandable. I have loved everyone of her books that we have received. They are wonderful, I wish there were more books like these!"
2,I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.
2,"Was that even a Van Damme film ? ... oh well , that's how I would discribe this Van Damme film .Great sets , Great locations , Great costumes , Great props , ok acting ... this is Van damme after all !The only 2 things I could complain about is the fact that Van Damme was a little bit cheesy about being proud to be a LEGIONAIRE and the ending ( I wont spoil it) .... it just seemed prodictable to me .All in all , this is a good film and I recommend this as one of the best Van Damme films ."
1,Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
1,"THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE Fluke 617727 Clamp-on Current Probe INDICATES CLEAR GOOD THAT: Fluke Clamp-on Current Probe is to 1000 amp AC/DC current clamp for ideal DMMs and is the digital tool to extend the current ranges of multimeters. THEY SENT ME THE MODEL I410 WHO IS GIVES 400 AMP OF RANGE, NOT THE ONE THAT BUYS THAT SUPPOSEDLY IT(HE,SHE) IS GIVES 1000 AMP OF RANGE, I FEEL DEFRAUDED BECAUSE I PAID FOR A Clamp-on Current Probe GIVE MORE CAPACITY AND THEY GAVE TO ME ONE OF MINOR CAPACITY."
1,Um I think this movie was pathetic. i like sponge bob but come on now spongebob gets drunk and then they have way to much violence in this movie goin our havin a hit man goin after sponge bob and patrick oh my gosh what is this world coming to taking a kids cartoon and puttin so much violence into it.
2,"Good product, good delivery. However, I wound up replacing with an LED unit I'm happier with. If you are replacing the reflector, pay the couple extra bucks and upgrade to LED."
2,I have only read 2 of her books first I read Ransom and I just finished The Secret I would never suggest you to read it in that order read The Secret first and then read Ransom YOu will fall in love with the characters so quickly. Julie Garwood is so good at adding humor and romance and drama into her novels. These two novels compliment each other and once you pick these books up they are hard to put down. I promise that they are a great buy.
2,My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.
2,This classic never gets old. I read it as a child and I still enjoy reading it to this day.
2,"This is a nice tool for beginners and intermediate level learners of MSA, but if you've been studying for a while you will find this a bit frustrating. The 4000 words utilized are good, but they won't take you to the next level. The lists are good, but it would be nice to be able to make your own. A section of Arabic proverbs would be very useful as well, as knowing them makes a real difference when dealing with native speakers. I would pay $25 for this, but no more."
1,I still have not recieved my book that I ordered 11-19.I have filed a claim. I can not give an opinion about the book.
1,"I got this book expecting a bunch of puzzles from the cover and title. There are many other items to be found, but everything looks very out-dated. Definitely keep looking if you want puzzles or other up-to-date patterns.Wayne"
2,This book was fascinating. It took a short passage from the bible and painted a picture of how it could have been. I will definitely be reading more of these books.
2,This is an amazing film. The graphics on this film were exquisite. It just goes to show that Keanu Reeves can play any part. He is a exorcist that is trying to buy his way into heaven by casting demons back into the hell from which they came. There is only one outcome to this breath taking plot. Will he get in or will he get rejected? You have to see it to believe.
2,Very fast connection workS great while watching netflix and youtube videos on tivo. I was told by a friend that its better to use hard wire than wireless but this couldn't be farther from the truth. This works great and I haven't had any problems with the speed. I would recomind this for anyone who has a tivo.
2,"These are exceptional diapers! They are far superior to the Pampers Swaddlers that the hospital sent us home with. The Swaddlers were nice, but we have had several leaks while using them and not a single leak using the Baby Dry. The price is the best around when you sign up for the Amazon Mom program.Since size seems to matter with diapers, our baby is ~10 lbs and 20""."
2,"A ""must read"" for anyone interested in the WWII carrier navy, R.Adm. Gallery relates the tedium of service in Iceland, the terror of being stalked by German U-boats in the North Atlantic, capped off with the true-adventure tale of his Carrier Task Group's *capture* of the German U-boat 505 (now on display in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry) off the African coast. D.V. Gallery intersperses writing fit for an adventure novel with the facts of history from the ""big seat"" aboard the USS Guadalcanal - one of the ""baby flat-tops"" of the Second World War (probably the single most underrated warship of that war)"
2,Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.
2,I found this one to be better than the second one - if you like movies you would want to watch all three of them or only the first one which is excellent and in my opinion the best of all of them.
1,"I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."
2,"""Subrosa Subway"" hooked me right in. ""Calling Occupants"" a masterpiece. No one thought it could be done...the Beatles sound in an experimental way, but my goodness, an attention and care to arranging was astounding. No mop top hype to hide behind.The fact that they wanted it released with no individual song credits made it feel like a group effort. As they wanted no one to look at the album in none other way than an experience. And they the achieved with flying colours. This album is the reason I even got into songwriting or noticed songwriting as an art form.Indeed a special album for me all time."
2,"Could one of the Bob Newhart Show fans tell me what season the episode of Bob Hartley dresses as Zorro for a masquerade party,and ends up on the ledge of of a building is included on?Thank You."
1,I still do not have my book and it's been over 30days. I would like a full refund for what has been charged to my credit card- $88.00 immediately. i would not order from this person again! I only put one star because there was no option for Zero Stars.
1,I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
2,HEB is a Texas icon grocery store. They chose to not stock David Sunflower Kernels. The store brand they chose to substitute for David is so bad we had to throw it away uneaten. Thanks for selling the David brand.
2,Been long time since last read..still worth a re-reading..everyone should pass there once or twice in their life; during adoloesence when less tolerant and understanding of its content to complete a class assignment..and later after many life experiences to better appreciate and relate more of its content.
1,"This book [stinks]. I read this book only, because I seen the preview for the movie. It jumps around from one thing to the next. John Keel is a nut, ""the phone rang and nobody was there!"" ""That could only mean the time traveling space aliens, cause no human would be capable of calling my house and hanging up."" ""The CIA/FBI are out to get me"" Please!!! Go see a shrink."
1,"Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as ""New"" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as ""New"""
2,Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it.
2,"A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think."
2,"An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
1,"I ordered the ""75cm GoFit COMMERCIAL GRADE Stability Ball"" that is pictured.What I received was the less expensive ""GoFit 2000lb. Professional Grade Core Stability Ball"" that has cartoon characters on it, the very same one that I had previously purchased at a local BIG 5 for around $15 and had returned because of poor quality... NOT HAPPY!!."
1,Music from the 30's and very nostalgic. My father played with this band when he was still in college in 1934.
2,"We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)"
1,Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.
2,"I have read thousands of books, including all kinds of literature, but I am nearly sure that this is the best book I have ever read."
2,"If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)"
1,This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.
1,"Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
2,"When he made this album, John Coltrane considered it to be his gift to God. It's certainly worthy of that status, having some really amazing instrumentals, including, of course, John Coltrane's masterful saxaphone playing. I'm a drummer, and I can testify that this album is also a prime example of really skillful jazz percussion. If you're looking to start a really fine jazz collection, this would be an important album to include.If you liked this, I recommend Coltrane's ""Giant Steps."" It's a little bit less serious, slightly more bouncy, but of similar excellence."
2,"Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride! This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack. Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her. As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture. The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced! All in all, an excellent movie!"
2,I LOVE this product. I've only been using it 2 weeks and already I see a difference. Once I get a tan the dimples will be much less noticeable as well. My skin is so much softer and I notice I don't have to shave as much either...not sure if that's from the lotion but I'll let it take the credit!! I have already recommended this to MANY friends and some enemies...lol.
2,"I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
2,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
2,Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
2,"This book is mind boggling. Next to the Bible, it is the best book I have ever read. It is very clearly and concisely written and very practical in its application. No one who applies these principles can ever be defeated!!!"
1,The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.
2,"This double volume CD is a great tool for the begginer and experts DJ who mixes CDs. Since CD mixing is still fairly modern it is hard to find good loops, beats, scratches, and effects. Simmon Harris has put together a wide range of beats for DJ's to use. Each track includes the BPM (beats per minute), a very helpfull feature that you won't find too often. The price may seem steep at first glance, yet when you realize the use you will get out of this great tool it is worth it. ""Once you use it, you will never put it away"""
1,Quite old and outdated. Had to laugh at some things in this book. Please go with a newer version from this century:-)
2,"The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
2,"I hadn't watched the American Idol show, but when I heard a song on the radio I had to have the cd. I was not disappointed.It is completely entertaining.Hard to believe he is only beginning his career.His songs seem heartfelt as if he were a seasoned veteran of the music business. I found myself moved and inspired. I highly recommend it."
2,This is a present for my nephew. I don't see anyeducational value to this game. I used to play thisgame in the arcade. It is a lot of fun. You have tobe quick enough to not let the worm join itself back.Keep you hands on the trigger. Blast away!Enjoy!
2,"A very funny movie from director/poducer/star Mekhi Phiffer about two guys who just want to watch the Shawshank Redemption marathon on TNT. If you think pyramid schemes are funny or if you are a big fan of the Shank then you will love this movie. I admit it is low budget and straight to DVD but it is funnier than a lot of big budget blockbuster comedies that I have seen. Phiffer does a great job in his role as the big business entrepenuer. The plot is original and there are some really hilarious scenes. If you think about it, there are some parts of the film that really ring true. I grew up only seeing the TV edited version of the Shank and didn't know about the rape scene(Which is an important part of the plot) until much later when I saw the unedited version."
2,"this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid."
1,"Interesting..., Bought a Bones 2, 2 years ago.., had issues with one of the arms; called to ask for the ""so called"" lifetime warranty..; the guy on the phone spent more time convincing me that the issue was MY FAULT instead of attending my request. Just bought a Thule Gateway 9007! exc!!!"
2,I received confirmation that the book had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. The book was in great shape and the price was exceptional.
2,I read this book in elementary school. I loved it. I've now purchased it for my kids!
1,"Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie."
2,Here's a tip - don't shake it up and down. Turn the unit upside down so that the back of the unit is facing the ceiling and shake it side to side. My older son (7) uses that method and he can get it to recover quickly and find viruses as easy as pie. I actually took this sucker apart - the motion detection unit is actually a small metal marble that rolls over a circuit board contact - be careful taking it apart tho - its would be easy to lose the marble and then it would never work.The battery has also lasted for us 2 weeks under fairly strong use - he's up to level 16. My yonger son (5) also has one and while he's not as enthralled - no problems.
1,"MTL really screwd-up bigtime by issuing the same UPC number to their entire music catalog. Most Marketplace sellers on Amazon upload their product by UPC, so you can end up with any title from the MTL catalog. Before purchasing this title or any title from the MTL line, be sure to inquiry as to what the Marketplace seller is offering! This will save you a ton of stress.As far as the album ""SOUL HITS, Vol 1"" goes... it is definitely worth having and is chocked full of classic soul jams we all love. It is definitely a great addition to any collection... if you can find it!Good Luck!"
1,"If I tell the whole horrible story I could right a book, but I'll give the run down on this deal:1st TV: went out 2 hours after it arrived (Sept 2006)2nd TV: didn't work the day we got it (Dec 2006)See the time difference in trying to get a TV that works and we never got one??? This has been a nightmare and finally Polaroid has agreed to refund our money for this mess! Thank goodness for Corporate managers!!! Try to steer clear from the refurbs, if you want my advice."
2,"A good book if you are a beginner and want to learn about grinding. But it lacks (much needed in my case) depth. The author knows a lot about the grinding process, so why doesn't he put it in his book!"
2,"For all the times that the release was delayed, and all the speculation on the title, what the songs would sound like, and all else, this album does disappoint a Clay fan. Clay has this amazing ability to pour so much emotion into whatever he sings, he pulls you into the song. This is especially true if you have seen him perform a song live. And despite the critics trying to pigeonhole his fan base, he appeals to everyone, and the songs on the CD do just that. I have no way to pick to a favorite, its different each time I listen to it."
1,"This book is an incomplete mess.Throughout the book there are sample questions to ""quiz"" the reader on the material. BEWARE! many of the answers in the book are wrong.For the harder topics this isn't even a guide at all. Only a list of study points.The CD with practice questions repeats many of the questions in the book and had incorrect answers.A good replacement for this book is a brick wall. Stare at it and you will acheive the same results as reading this book."
2,This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12.
1,"After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble."
2,"Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift."
1,"Hello People, I am going to be reviewing a Movie that ruined my school reputation.... The Movie itself is OK....These famous actors who are chosen to play mario and luigi are acting in this movie, OK.. So I was in first grade when I watched this on VHS, and then my best friend Louis who was sitting next to me at story time was talking to me and then this picture from the movie came in to my mind and I told him ""Let's be bad!"" From that day in first grade I would always go to the pricipals office and never complete assignments. That is why I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 10, if you are 10, please have an adult with you so you don't get any ideas.Huge Mario Bros fan that is above 10... OK you can watch it, if you are age 9 or below please steer clear of this title.Please get this movie if you are above the age of ten!J.R. Platt"
2,"Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first ""serious"" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."
2,This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
1,"These are THE worst diapers I have ever used. I have never had soooo many leaks, soaked through diapers, messes all over my son, in his 28 months of life, than I have with this pack of Pampers Diapers. I will never buy Pampers again & will share my opinion to others."
2,"Its sad that the movie will only last a week or two in the theatres since it is a good rip roaring adventure that loosely follows the Lafayette Escadrille in WWI. The special effects are excellent, the planes and action appears to be real. If you get a chance see it on the big screen, it will lose a lot on video"
1,"Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."
1,"I had bought this vest primarily for pushups but when i tried it on i had noticed that most of the weight was positioned on my mid to lower back area. i was concerned that a.) it may end up causing my form to be compromised and b.) i may also end up ultimately injuring my self or at the very least not reaping the full benefit. otherwise i supposed itd be an okay vest for other exercises that didn't matter if it hung a little low eg pullups, dips.. maybe.. i would NOT recommend this for running or even walking unless you keep your back straight and have perfected your form as you may injure yourself with the lower center of gravity and weight. so at the end of it all i decided to return it and go with the ""mir short style vest"" that was twice as much but was designed with (virtually) all the weight on the upper back and chest area (which may in fact be superior to most vests out there..) hope this helps!"
1,I've seen printed versions of this book and I've been thinking about getting it for a while. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the kindle version would be in black and white. When discussong color and showing diagrams showing the actual colors really helps. I am soo soo disappointed with this purchase. The books content itself is amazing but I'm going to rethink ordering ebooks from amazon in the future.
2,"I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
1,"I unfortunately had to read this book for school because its required for 9th grade. The book was a little hard to follow and i think that this book is too mature. There is so much swearing that you will not even believe it. The ""n"" word is used often and so is a lot of other bad things I cant(and don't) even want to type. Save this book for older high school students. I read some other reviews and they state that they were required to read this on 8th grade. That's just crazy! The ending is so sad and every character is this book has issues or problems. Overall i give this book 1 or 2 stars. The main idea was good and the length of the story was ok too. Not too long not too short."
2,I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THOSE THAT RATE TOP NOTCH GAMES WITH ONE OR TWO STARS AS SOME HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE=THE GRAPHICS IN THIS GAME IS WORTH THE COST OF THE GAME ALONE=IT IS CLEVER AND TOUGH TO GET TO THE HEARTS AND IF YOU GET BORED PLAYING THIS GAME YOU NEED TO GO GET A LIFE=THIS IS A BREATH-TAKING GAME AND VERY VERY CLEVERLY DONE=TONS OF RE-PLAY VALUE!!!
2,This charger is just what I needed to replace my Apple charger and it costs a whole lot less. The only recommendation is that you make sure to plug it into a surge protector as there is no third-prong ground on it.
2,"This is a pioneering work, the first history of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Hutton himself admits the diffculty of the task)gives a full scholarly review of the Pagan movement, its history and the ideas and cultural background of its tenents. Outstanding!"
1,"I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
2,"I got this at an excellent sale price, and I have never regretted it. I haven't had a single problem with the card, and I didn't have to reformat it for it to work with my Canon A40."
1,"ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
1,"Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."
2,"This book is a fictionalized account of Angela's life and her suffering from abuse, parental and then spousal. She overcame this cruel treatment to become a driving force in helping others escape from their own hell. Read it and learn."
1,"Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance..."
2,This album is amazing! The vocal range Clay displays is truly inspiring. The true World Idol has made a name for himself with this debut album.
1,"Please don't waste your money or time on this book. Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same. If you just have to spend your money on something, choose a good charity."
1,"What you would expect from a hollywood production. If you LOVE Hollywood, you'll LOVE this, otherwise go check out something that is actually freaky, I.E. The Changling or Suspiria."
2,I think that if this warmer was any hotter... it might cook my coffee during the day. I am just glad to reach over and not have my coffee stone cold. I really like it.
2,"this is such a cute show! even after all these years im still in love with all the charactors and even the reruns are fun to watch. EVERY season of Three's company's great, definatly worth the $$"
2,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, the music is just great. And the fact that my first husband was there may have some thing to do with it. Besides that I still love the movie and the music. If you haven't seen it yet I'd say your missing a very good movie.And the price was just out of this world, you can't beat [..]every where that I have looked the price is over [..]. So thank you.Thank YouDebbie Quintanarquinnabe@sbcglobal.net"
2,"I don't generally like nonfiction/biography books, but The Cannibal's Wife is a sensitive, moving read. I only gave it 4 stars because the subject matter made me, well, disturbed. Nevertheless, I recommend it highly. Sometimes we need to be disturbed."
1,"I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."
1,"Constantine is a very bad adaptation of the Comic book called Hellblazer and when I say bad, I do mean bad. It really desecrates what the comic book stood for and shows that Hollywood only cares about themselves, not the fans. Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou gives good performances in this heap of junk because they at the very least tries their best with the very bad script that they had to work with while Keanu and the rest of the actors ham it up to the hill.See it for their performances alone"
1,"Not sure exactly what went wrong here - but this version of the book is RIDDLED with laughable typos. Horrible punctuation, missing words, random periods thrown in everywhere. ""ERIC"" becomes ""ERIE"" throughout. What the hell? Was this reprinted by monkeys?DONT BUY THIS VERSION."
1,"Buy a different amplifier! I bought this because of the price and the output, but it has one feature that makes it so unbelievably annoying that I'm glad to be rid of it. It has a gate on it that is suppose to automatically switch between inputs. The way its suppose to work is if you have two inputs it will automatically switch to the one carrying the signal. Instead of working the way it should it automatically shuts off once the input level gets low, causing a clicking that cuts out the quietest parts of your music. During a fade in or out it just cuts out! If you're constantly using a high output device this might work for you, but anything less and this amp is no good."
2,"This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani & Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!"
2,"The TiVo adapter is practically effortless to install. Once installed, the TiVo Series2 recognizes the adapter easily, then you can walk through the configuration to set it up on the wireless network. The only challenging part is the cumbersome entry of the SSID, due to the TiVo interface for text entry. But once it was configured, it connected OK and is far superior to using the phone line by any means."
1,"I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
2,"A stunning boxset beutifully designed with wonderful Loy Powell pictures inside and outside. Every film is worth watching especially the later ones. Powell's and loy's chemistry does not fade. Definitly a boxset to own along with The Thin Man Collection, these two are timeless. Hghly recommended."
2,"Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood."
2,"An amazingly beautiful lyrical book which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book. And most delightful of all, the images linger long after the last page has been read."
1,"I would like to know if there are any books that beside this book so that I can learn Illustrator. In particular, Using the Pen tool or other features. That's right, so I can learn and understand more about the topic and get well prepared for a career in design and graphics.I am wondering if this is possible, I'd like to learn about Illustrator ASAP.Thank you very much for your time and help.If you are reviewing other Illustrator books, please inform if they will be able to help. So far, this one and two others have been of no good to me."
2,"When it comes to diapers, there is really only one major criteria that it has to have in our household: the diaper cannot leak/result in major blowouts. While I know that there are no 100% leak proof/blow out proof diaper out there, the Pampers Baby Dry diapers come pretty close. We have not experienced any leaks with Pampers, as opposed to store brands or Luvs.Our daughter is highly prone to diaper rashes, and with the Pampers Dry Max, we've noticed that her rashes have decreased significantly when wearing these diapers. The diapers absorb so much liquid, and keeps it away from our daughter's skin! The one gripe we have with Pampers is the scent - their diapers are generally heavily perfumed. If your kid makes a big stink, this may not be a bad thing - we just didn't care to smell our daughter before we heard her enter a room (deposit or not!). Outside of that, these diapers are fantastic! Highly recommended!"
2,"I am not sure what everyone is talking about, when they say they are not unrated? I ordered my 3 pack of unrated Feast dvds and that is exactly what came in my mailbox. Fantastic movies, all of them! Very comical, gory and action packed! I am very pleased with mine. Sorry to hear about other peoples issues."
2,"I was introduced to this charming little mystery while a schoolboy, and the enthusiasm of my teacher (Agnes Hay) resulted in a lifetime passion for British history. If you're such a buff, you will thoroughly enjoy this fictional modern-day examination of the Murder of the Princes in The Tower of London. Delightful---you'll want to curl up and enjoy it all in one sitting!"
2,"And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS."
1,"Sorry, but this album is probably the worst I've heard all year. It's so bland it's impossible to distinguish one cliched, tune-free track from the next. The cynicism of Simon Fuller and the whole American Idol team is exposed again - they knew that Clay's first album would go multi-platinum however useless it was, so have made no effort whatever.They clearly have no interest in developing Clay as a long-term artist. If they did, they'd have given him some good material so people would come back for more the second time. Here in the UK, the first Pop Idol winner Will Young has just had a massive success with his second album - in part because his first one was actually good, and the public were not duped into buying a half-baked CD like this which isn't worth the plastic it's packaged in. It will be interesting to see what Clay does next - if I were him, I'd start writing my own songs. Whatever his talent, they couldn't be any worse than the ones on *Measure of a Man*."
2,"You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."
1,"They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color. Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top. I was so upset. Deceiving and conniving company. Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back. I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought ""hey, it only happened to one person"" Well, it happened to me too. Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box, so I don't know how good/bad the quality is yet. The sizing is right, I am a woman's 8, to that is a men's 6.It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected, but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops. The picture was of high top shoes."
2,"My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. We can always refer back to it if we need a refresher course. The breathing technique and education was on point."
1,"The Greatest Generation they might well have been. The stories are compelling and diverse, However, Mr Brokaw's writing style is an abomination, His prose is dry. He does not trust the reader to be able to draw the significance or irony of the events descibed, rather he is compelled to tell the reader: ""This is significant. This is ironic."" He holds the readers hand rather than setting them free to think about the lives and to appreciate their beauty. I think only bright pink highlighting of the sentences would have been more annoying. All and all, a great topic, great lives but an overbearing and boring presentation. Apparently, Mr. Brokaw is not content to be a reporter but feels it is necessary to be remedial reading instructor as well"
2,"This bed is awesome, perfect size, pump works great just a bit noisy like a vaccuum cleaner, ordered it on friday got monday the next week even though i used standard shipping (3-5 business days)."
2,"The diapers are great, but at my local wal mart they are only $10.00 with out shipping charges..."
2,"If you want your hands to be free, use your head. When I crawl under a desk to connect a computer, now I can see what I am doing and use the glowing screen on my cell phone to make calls and not cast a blue haze on the cables. Works well when I am in the wiring closet (by myself) now I have light were I need it and two hands free."
2,"I love the softness of these diapers, and the characters are cute. However, they seem to leak more than the Huggies I was using before. Therefore, I'm going to try another brand or go back to Huggies... :("
2,"Very comprehensive, can get you up and running in 48 hours. A very thin book that contains the bare essentials as to familiarize yourself with MIDI and the initial steps to set up a working compilation of MIDI products. Explains concepts such as sequencers, samplers, MIDI-IN/OUT/THRU and countless more... the good part is that even though it holds great amounts of information, the book is orgenized in a way that is easily referenced in the future. It's easy... it's wonderful."
1,These people cannot sing on key or write a melody that sounds like more than cacauphony! Terrible! I couldn't stand to listen to it.
1,"I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
1,"Bought it for my 17"" MacBook and it is inches too big in both dimensions. Can't use it without cutting it down and then you lose the cutouts that allow the cover to close. The company never responded to emails about returning or exchanging.A total waste of money, will never buy from this company again. Bad product and absolutely no customer support!"
1,I didn't see the logic behind this garment. It's suppose to hold in the belly but yet there's a little opening at the bottom where my belly sticks out from. I sent this back and got the bottomless one. I love that one i have been wearing that one for years.
1,"the item description says this is aluminum, but when i received the item, the box says 'solid steel'. very dissappointing! i live by the beach and steel doesn't last long. it was for my son's birthday, now i have to send it back and he won't have his main present!"
2,"This album is worth the wait. Great vocals accompanied by rocking fuzzed out riffs. Sounds like the perfect cross between Unida and Kyuss. The cd hasn't left my player yet. The only problem I have (which means 4 stars instead of 5) is that its fairly short. It really only has 7 tracks that total under 30 minutes. That aside, any fan of this genre of music will love it. The cd flat out rocks all the way through."
2,This is a powerful book. It is written in a clear and engaging style. It is important that people know about the human rights abuses going on in Sudan. Mr. Bok's story does this in a meaningful and moving way.
2,This has been an amazing experience to play and has a great chance to be one of the best Gamecube games I have played ever. One of the best games ever too. Definitely pick it up as it has lots of everything you can ask for. Definitely up there with FE7 as the best of the series.
1,"When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so."
1,"I was looking for a book that was a little more enlightened and a little less materialistic. This author clearly likes to shop (I am not a shopper), so it was hard to relate. Most of the ideas I have read before. I think the title is a little misleading. When I think about meaning, I think of higher ideals -- not just having more time to read a book in a quiet corner of my house. I don't know...I think if you have a strong sense of what brings meaning, you might find this book a bit superficial. Writing is good and there are good quotes too."
2,I got my second one of these recently. Now I keep a charger at work and another at home so I don't have to carry them back and forth. The one at home has been in use for a year now with no problems; they're more durable than the Apple ones at a fraction of the cost.
1,"I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie."
1,"I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."
1,"As I wrote in my review of season one, season two was going to make or break Sanctuary. And it broke.Only watched the DVD set, so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit, it might not have been so bad. Ms Tapping's acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn't improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season). And just before I started writing this, I see there's a season three!?! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans. There's so little really good stuff to watch, that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me. Ever. No surprise amazon has season two ""on sale""."
1,Download went great. It has been a difficult read due to the way it was written. The historical side of the book is great.
1,I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain.
1,"There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
2,"This book has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. Describes some beautiful country. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevatnion, navigation, time, and season. The USGS topos for the tour are listed, along with excellent tour maps. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you thorough the tour.I like the book, but I would also like to see an index and more tours for the Yosemite high country."
2,"This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. The first half is what I consider a small Big Band. With other Sax players, trumpets and guitar. The second half is the Rollins Trio. With that said I simply Love this CD., Grand Street is my favorite song, it instantly lights up the whole room. The sound is tight and powerful. I do prefer the first half with it's rich full sound. The second half is good but less attention getting. The playing however is excellent. For a great mix of styles and sound on one CD your cannot lose with this one."
1,"This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book."
1,"I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
2,"It took me forever to finally get this gem, but it was so worth the wait. Some of the best music I've ever heard. They had it all! Wouldn't it be great for them to get together again?! I just wonder if they really know just how good they were and how much they are missed."
2,"Nobody has come even remotely close to my all time idol....Tina Turner. Her physical beauty, her wonderful personality, her amazing voice, the awesome lyrics in her songs....and I could go on and on.But Clay Aiken is giving her a run for her money in all those areas !! His CD is 'Simply The Best' I've heard in a very long time.I have listened to it over and over trying to determine which one of the songs is my favourite. But I can't narrow it down...I LOVE all of them.I now have to go out and buy another copy for my car so that I can listen to it while driving as well.The CD is:C......Captivating !L......Lively !A......Awesome !Y......Yummy !"
2,The High Ceilings is a great band. Max Heinegg is a musical genius. I recommend all thier albums.
2,"I liked the book, but it was kind of sad in a good way though because no matter what George knew that Lennie was going to die so he killed him in a less painfull way.Steinbeck created really good characthers because they were so believable that it could of most likely been a non-fiction story. It's a good novel for young adults because it talks about stuff that could happen in real life and little kids might not understand the story or the words in the story. The social issue that it relates to is probably racism."
2,great product to save money! Dont worry about leaving the light on anymore. It is easy to install and instructions are straight forward
2,"Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced."
2,"I find this book most useful for the 12 star maps found at the very begining. It gives basic information about astronomy in a comprehensible manner. The book is handy enough to keep with you and with a small penlight you can reference the maps while observing the night sky, easily fits in a jacket or pans back pocket. Additionally I found the mythology behind the traditional western culture naming of the constellations interesting.Only criticisms include 1) as previously mentioned, no star charts for the Southern Hemisphere and 2) wasted pages printing illustrations of the characters the constellations represent. These pages could have been used to add Southern Hemisphere maps or to discuss more then the listed 13 constellations."
1,"I have never bought a worse record. (And I have about six or seven hundred in all.) His voice has been produced out and the songs are as unmemorable as they come. Absolutely horrible.Whoever is handling his career - which must be over after this fiasco - has taken a perfectly decent singer and turned him into muzakChristmas is coming. Unfortunately, I know no one I dislike enough to foist this thing off on.Anonymously, of course. I wouldn't even want this CD in my trash bin, so I am going to have to dump it somewhere far away in the dead of night. Otherwise, the trashman might find out that I had actually spent my hard-earned money on this tripe."
2,This Amp is fantastic for use as a booster in a system to power certain speakers. I use it for the center channel and for seat shakers. Auto on feature is great and the bridge function allows for use as an amp for the center channel or an unpowered subwoofer.
2,"This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing."
2,I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. I wear this necklace often and love it!
1,Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service.
2,My son loves to listen to the tape. It had wonderful songs and it really involves the kids. I must admit that I too love to listen.
1,"Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again."
2,"This is possibly the greatest book ever written! It is SO cool! I couldn't put it down. I can easily relate to Kit's life, and so can many peole."
1,"Unfortunately, this book just made me more angry.This book might be okay for a person who subscribes to the religious views of the authors, but since I do not, I was annoyed at having been duped into buying a religious book under the guise of a psychology book, not to mention the bad advice inside it. I tried to get through it anyway, but after two valiant attempts (if I do say so myself) I decided I couldn't do it. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I wrote it in (as the book instructs) before I saw the religious stuff. Also, nowhere on the front does it say anything about religion, and only in tiny, tiny text above the barcode does it say it should be categorized as ""religious"" and the category ""psychology"" is absent."
2,"I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."
2,This is by far the best documentation of the Peoples Temple and the JonesTown tragedy!
2,"This to me is the realistic view of the animals coming to Noah before the Ark was finished. Noah, his family and the animals became acquainted with each other before the flood. This is beautiful."
1,"I purchased our Emer from Sears almost two years ago, and it broke within a month. We sent it back to New Jersey, and it took two months to have it returned. Within a month it was broken. Now it is a pile of plastic and I don't know what to do with it. Very disappointed in product and service."
2,"This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read."
1,I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. It broke into a million pieces on arrival. You could hear the delivery guy when he was walking to my door. VERY DISAPPOINTED because it was a gift. Returned it right away! Buyer beware!!
1,"This thriller was always an extremely entertaining Hitchcock knockoff (nothing at all like Basic Instinct, despite the other reviews here) -- if you could buy Gere as a therapist, and that's not hard, since he's not playing a *smart* therapist -- but a lot of the charm of the movie was how gorgeous it was visually, and this DVD does not give you the gorgeous anarmorphic widescreen picture you expect from a DVD. It's formatted to fit your (square) screen. I would much rather have paid 20 bucks for the expected widescreen version -- since I already had the VHS, this wasn't even worth 10. (Yes, I admit I should have read the product description more carefully, but I didn't realize people were releasing widescreen movies on DVD without a widescreen option -- why should they, for crying out loud? -- so I got blindsided. I post this to warn others like myself.)"
2,Just what I wanted. A replacement for the original exhaust (that was rusted out) that sounded just alittle louder. This exhaust sounds perfect without being excessive. The bolt-on system was pretty straight forward but I did replace my catalytic converter as well.
2,"Motorhead put their blueprint together for this album, and it is very good (especially ""Pay Your Price"" and ""I'll be Your Sister"") but they still needed to hone in on the speed and aggression."
1,"It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though."
2,"I have owned one of these rice cookers for a number of years, and decided to give a couple of them for gifts. They are an excellent unit.I was very happy with the service from Amazon."
1,"This case is ""sticky"" to open, a bit heavy and so each time you want to use your unit, you have to struggle with it. It sort of compromises the reason you have a PDA to begin with."
2,This book arrived in a short amount of time and was in very good condition
1,"Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad clich after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.Avoid."
2,"My hubbie wanted this since he read about it's health benefits (we all need amino acids!). We have found that it is really yummy - a great salt substitute (kindof tastes like soy sauce, and is pretty salty tasing - though not actually high in salt). We even use it as salad dressing and veggie dressing, in addition to in stir fry and other (roasts, casseroles)."
1,"I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
2,"FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets."
1,"Whoever directed this must never have watched any NASA production or any shuttle launches. The personalities chosen to represent the astronauts would have been better suited representing shoe salespeople (sorry shoe salespeople - it's a good job, just not astronaut ready). The dialogue was unbelievable; the storyline seemed more made up for daytime TV drama; the spacecraft and Mars sets were way to cheap for today's standards.The every-so-often instructional monologue was fit for grade school and seemed forced and out-of-place. The storyline didn't even seen to have a point to it.Conclusion: FF through this pointless, cheaply done production."
2,"I ordered 2 sets of samples. Everything came in time, & I was very pleased. The seller even included a ton of free extras too, which I was very happy about :]. The products themselves are 'pretty good'. I recommend the shampoo/conditioner & the foaming face wash [my favorite]. Overall, a very good seller. I'll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average. The eye moister jell was also very good too."
1,"If the Matrix And the Exorcist got together and had a baby and it came out as a turd then that would be this movie. Terrible acting, the worst script this side of Reefer Madness, and an unplausible plot revolving around (sigh) the Devil, a hippy-dressing angel, and a holy artifact found in (What!) Mexico? The only thing realistic about that was how easy it is for illegals to cross the border. Now, everyone put their forearms together and repeat after me: GO INTO THE TOILET, I COMMAND THEE! Now flush."
1,"Not the external package, but the box for this product is damaged. The lotion spilt over the bottle and made me don't wanna try it on my skin."
1,"My negative comments have nothing to do with the content as Hodge wrote it, which is excellent. But the quality of the Kindle edition is very poor. The OCR scan has resulted in unintelligible words in almost every paragraph, and the lack of links in the table of contents severely limits the usefulness as a reference source. It's not completely useless; in general I can find what I'm looking for and make sense out of the text. So for 99 cents I suppose I'm getting my money's worth. But an edition of better quality would be most welcome."
1,"I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. I contacted the company that shipped the bag, something like 'Sports Accessories', not Rawlings. After 3 months of poor communication (and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle) they informed me that their service department was closing. I asked them to return the broken buckle, but no response. The story is longer than this, but as a result of horrible customer service, I now have a briefcase that i cannot use."
2,"This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time."
2,"I know it sounds a little cheesy now, but for the time, it was way kewl. Depeche Mode are pioneers of synth-pop, and have evolved into an underground sensation and beyond. My favorites are: ""New life""-Bouncy and jivey. ""Puppets""-Dark and juicy. ""Photographic""-Awesome. Perverted? ""Tora, tora, tora""-Slammin and energetic. ""Voices""-Martin sings this one. Vintage Mode. This is a campy joyride! Put it on and get all sappy, remembering how cool the 80's actually were..."
2,"After several months of searching, as this book was already out of print, I finally located a used copy and it turned into the best buy for me in a long time. With an extensive index and related subject references at the end of each chapter, navigating the book is easy. It's size is enough to make most readers weak in the knees, but if it's treated more as a reference book to be used as the situation arises, you'll soon reserve a place of honor on the desk for easy reach. Most of the instructions are easy to understand, even for beginners like myself. There are some areas I've avoided for when I feel more comfortable, but that is a very small portion of the book. I do sometimes wish the examples were a little less basic to help take the reader beyond the very simplest concepts of database management. But, then again that's what really makes this book so helpful in the first place. After two years of regular use, I still refer to it for a refresher."
2,"This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. I do have all 3 movies on dvd, but this is one film franchise I don't mind double dipping into. The transfers to blu ray are spectacular. Great picture quality, and sound. My only complaint is that the special features for the first 2 films are non existent, but like I said, I have the dvds so if I needed to get my special feature fix then I could just pop those in. If your like me and love these movies, then do yourself a favor and get the set. You won't be disappointed!"
1,"Sorry to bum people out but the vocals just ruin this, if you could call them vocals. It sounds like some one mumbling some spoken words under water or outside of the house when I listen to this on my great home stereo. It would have been a better release if they just left the vocals or mumbling off. This sounds like other darkwave/ambient works, Lycia is the closest comparison except Lycia's music is well made. Sorry for the low rating but I doubt this will get much play again and I have a wide variety of tastes, I rarely exclude anything."
1,"Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic. One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun. Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama. I perfer the first two"
2,"I had read the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20's. The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more."
1,"The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names. Highly overrated."
1,"This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
1,"I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night. I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak. If it was in a seam it was under warranty. I tried to find the leak, but was unable. I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak. I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone!"
1,"Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
2,"I can't get enough of this CD. I play it every day, many times a day. I hear the next single will be ""The Way"" with ""Solitaire"" on the B-side, both perfect choices. Clay's voice gets more unbelievably beautiful every time I hear him. I was worried about this CD catering more to what passes for popular music today, but, thankfully every track is a gem and remains true to Clay himself and his fans. My favorites are No More Sad Song, The Way, I Will Carry You, Run to Me, but it's really hard to pick favorites because they are all so good. I simply cannot wait for a brand new full CD of Clay. He and his voice are a winner in every sense of the word...and don't forget he just won American Music Award's Fans' Choice and a Billboard award for his single, This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Waters. As Diane Sawyer said, ""He's on a rocket to the stars!"""
1,"Overly long, pretentious, and Liam HAM Neeson sounds like he's giving a zen lecture at an agricultural college. Fight scenes? Plenty of them, but you don't really see anything being done. Worst choreographed fight scenes--if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it. Background of Batman looks like a ripoff of the origin of Dr. Strange mixed with Magnus Robot Fighter (Remember that one?) Some interesting stuff with the effeminate looking badguy shrink with his ""bag"" of tricks, but Batman himself looks like he'd fit in better as ""Fire Island Man."" This picture could have been a lot more than what it is, but it isn't. Still, if you like seeing gravity defied, the laws of physics ignored, and a pretty boy trying to look mean behind a mask, watch this dvd with your hand on the fast forward button."
2,"This arrived earlier than I thought. I love Tivo, so a wireless adapter is a great addition vs. the phone line. For those people who wonder what will happen when you plug it in, the Tivo software on the newer boxes will actually work like your laptop. The antenna will identify available wireless networks, and then you can link to them - no setting up of IP's etc., like the old USB days! If you have a wireless router, buy this!"
1,"This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience."
1,"Written by a failed spiritual seeker turned anti-spiritual polemical secularist, this book lacks the substance and insight possessed by a vaguely similar but nevertheless far superior work of disenchantment, Jeffrey Masson's *My Father's Guru*. Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge. Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism. Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?! The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read. Sadly, this work is by and large flat. So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi."
2,"they fit my daughter perfectly and i dont have to worry about leaks or anything anymore, before i started using Pampers Baby Dry Diapers my daughter's diaper would always leak esp when she pooped but now with Pampers Baby Dry Diapers they can totally handle anything she dishes out."
2,"Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. ""Belief is the enemy"",warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."
1,Now I am sitting on a big box of diapers that don't even fit my daughter anymore. Very disappointing since I thought that this would be a good deal.
2,"My husband and I drink instant coffee every morning before going to the office. For a long time I've been seeking the perfect coffee maker to elevate our coffee drinking pleasure, but for many reasons it's just simpler, quicker and hotter to drink instant coffee. So, you might call me an instant coffee connoisseur, because I've tried nearly all the instant varieties available at our local market. I can't say I adore any of them, but Nescafe rises to the top of the list when I rank them by taste, aroma and creme."
1,"I was looking for a source that would contain actual factual information on chemistry. This book is nothing but a long, absurd joke."
1,"The little content contained is interesting.However, the entire book is short chapters of journal notes with the occasional splash of commentary thrown in.Badly written, poorly organized.He could have at least organized it chronologically.The constant way of making himself out to besome sort of superhero got very annoying very quickly."
2,"I'm unsure about the result of Ashley being killed off... I liked the fact that Helen had someone, family. It seems a bit much to think of someone living that long and having no one. Love the series!"
1,"And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
1,"This wasn't worth reading, sadly. The plot was pretty well thought out, but the dialogue and characters were really underdeveloped."
2,I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori. I think that anyone who liked the series should get it. I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
1,"Received the product and it is NOTHING like described. Instead of the item as shown, the item is only a short stomach wrap and not a more full body item as pictured. Returned."
2,"My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship. You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an ""OK"" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the ""extra"" information isn't. The ""shame on you"" goes to The Richard Diercks Company, Inc., and Simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of ""what not to do"" in DVD production, development, and video transfer."
1,"This film is not worth the shipping and handling. George C. Scott gives a fabulous performance of a simply miserable script. The production values rival a poor film school project. The supplementary characters are obtuse and poorly developed; Patton's wife is both whiny and soporific. If you're a fan of the original, then you'll hate this. If you crave a ""Lifetime Original,"" then I suggest this movie."
1,"I made the huge mistake of buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since she is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!"
1,There is only one song on this CD worth listening to. Do not buy CD. I was very disappointed in this CD.
1,"Pampers Cruisers are the better of the Pampers diapers. I would not recommend this particular type, as they leak. Still better than most..."
1,"If you watch trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free. I consider this movie is just below the episode 2 and the 2 below 1. And nothing is new."
1,"Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Hazlitt has an opinion, and he presents it here. I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues, but more importantly, spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals.This book fails in that respect. Keep looking. (Samuelson, Mankiw, Malkiel...)"
1,"What a waste. You'd be just as well off with scotch tape. I threw it away. Yes, it was that bad."
1,"Let me count the ways that this is a horrible toy:If you put an egg in the carton wrong end down it can get VERY stuck and what kid knows to put the skinny end down?The case is flimsy plastic.The carton says 18 months+ but it is a choking hazard for kids under 3...hmmm.The ""quote"" on the side is supposedly by a 2 year old - ""With the Egg-Shape Sorter learning my shapes was over easy!"" - what 2 year old says that!!"
1,"I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."
2,This movie is just brillant! Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fabulous. and Liv Tyler sparkles. Plunkett and Macleane had all elements of a memorable movie that you'll want to watch again and again!
1,"I am still a fan of Clay Aiken because he has a beautiful voice. However, the song selection, style of his ""made-over"" voice was disappointing. I was looking forward to hearing that smooth sexy voice of American Idol songs he sang. It was not there. Whoever decided on these songs did no justice to Clay Aiken. Maybe next time... Sorry Clay."
2,I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection. It turned out to be a book club size and I traded it to a friend for the full size version.
1,"LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
1,"Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying."
2,My family watched the movie and loved it. It was exactly what we were looking for.....John Cena action flick to escape reality for a little while. Can't wait til his new movie comes out in March.
1,We have two Bernese Mountain dogs. Niether will use this collar. They fight to get it off the entire time. Tugging on it does not get their attention. PetCo also expects you to just mail items back with no documentation. Return for this is not handled by Amazon...
2,"damn! this band was a hot machine from the late '90s of the near northside of chicago. jim herout is a very stong drummer, and very much willing to take a risk. as a stong musician, he's the greatest unsigned drummer in north america. jim is psychadelic, brainy and fun. herout belongs with a tuff scene like american analog set. jim is a close friend of the neo-beat, paul brittain."
2,The biggest minus is having to remove the phone from the cradle and unplug the cord from the phone to remove from the car. Other than that minor inconvienence it works great
1,"Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."
2,Smallville needs to come back even if it is superman the early years. Tom Welling will always be my favorite Superman.
1,"Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance , Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.Skip it, you will thank yourself after you see it when its on cable."
2,This book is wonderful. You get caught up in the story of Krabat and his friends (and foes) at the mill of black magic. The earthiness of the story is great.
1,"Stop! You can't get Amazon Prime videos on this! It's also has linking problems that TiVo kept sending me to Amazon for, and Amazon then just showed me how to fix it on my TiVo, when TiVo could have told me. And they charge a monthly fee. Roku has no fee, it's cheaper, and easier to use."
1,WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!
2,"I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes."
2,"I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!"
1,"Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world. The only thing missing from this ""B"" grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys. Not at all what I had hoped for."
1,"I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read ""Into the Wilderness"" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author."
2,This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
2,This was a very interesting book about a little known woman in history. An amazing true story and an interesting search for the story by the author. A great book for anyone interested in the history of the Amazon River area.
1,"There are numbers of opinions out there on what to do about Diabetes. DR, Barnard certainly is one of them and worth finding out about. I'm still sorting whether this is the way I should go.I think his claim that he has a ""Cure"", is hype and this discredits his main point, but I haven't dismissed it yet."
1,Indepth information about PadrePio - but the story could have been told in the usual 90 mins.This man suffered with the stigmata for 50 years ! Locution - Read hearts - Heard confessions for 18 or more hours a day - people waited days to have him hear (read their hearts) confession.
2,"This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off."
1,"My girlfriend and I went to see The Haunting and almost walked out. I jumped once in the whole movie. It was slow, the acting was not very good. Do not waste your time with this one! I would have given this 0 stars but they did not have that option. BORED TO DEATH!"
2,I save from .04 to.07 per diaper (depending on sizes I have autoshipped and mr mom deductions) as opposed to walmart's price. This adds up to a minimum savings of $7.68 per box up to well over $10 per box on smaller sizes. I have 3 in diapers.
1,"I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
1,"This book causes my Kindle to freeze. Must do a complete reset to get it to work again. This is the only book, so far that caused a crash. I don't know if I will try to re-download it from Amazon. Weird huh?"
2,I heard some long-time fans of Michael Nesmith were confused. You'll listen to Michael's new sound.
1,"A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
1,"I heard a lot of chatter about this new girl M.I.A. and her album getting a lot of good reviews. I don't know if her phenomenon is a result of her label hyping her in publications or what, but after listening to her album once through, I would advise you to stay away unless ecstasy-rave music is your thing. She is nearly unintelligible on all of her vocals and is drowned out by the incessant reverb present on all most all of her tracks. This is the definition of drivel. I am happy for her and her interesting life story, but her music does not interest me. Save your $!"
2,"this cd is the bomb that has great songs like fadded, stay, and gravity. this is an awsome CD so buy it or u made a bad decison so by No one Does it better by soulDeicion"
2,"On the chapter about Lloyd Kilmer, there is a picture titled ""Liberation Day"". The photo was dated April 29, 1945. I help a gentleman by the name of Roy Sage. He is in this photo. Is there a way to make contact with any of the other soldiers? I believe this would make Mr. Sage very happy.Thanks for a great book, it brings joy to many.Marlese"
2,"Excellent value for abrading and stripping nonskid fiberglass deck surfaces to prep for painting. Bristles held together for years of abuse and left no rust stains. However, there was a dark gray residue that we cleaned off with solvents or soap and water to ensure good paint adhseion."
2,"This warmer was such a bargain and does exactly what I want it to do... keeps my cup or mug of coffee warm beside me as I work on my computer. I only gave it four stars because its surface seems uneven... my cups/mugs all rock a bit when sitting on it, and it's wearing along one edge. But that doesn't seem to affect its performance!"
1,"I expected better from Clay. This CD is just an example of Clay not being Clay. Why change? You have a great broadway, caberet voice Clay. Stop screaming and please step away from the pop music. It just isn't you!"
2,"I find ""Betrayed"" to be the best publicly available report on Vietnam era POWs. I speak as a former career Intelligence officer, Marine Corps Captain who served in Vietnam, and as an advisor to the Select Committee of the US Senate, which in 1990 was charged with looking into the POW/MIA disaster.Dr. Douglass brings impressive credentials to this book. He is a leading authority on Soviet era nuclear, biological , and chemical warfare, having taught on these matters at Johns Hopkins. He worked for Paul H. Nitze, former Secretary of the Navy, Ambassador, and confident of several U.S. Presidents.The POW/MIA question is complicated. Dr. Douglass is superb in his making sense of this complex mess. 'BETRAYED"" is well worth a close read, if one has a serious interest in this dark history. The POW question is important today, as the Russians used many US POWs, mostly pilots, for complex medical experiments to create ""Manchurian candidates"", affect and change behavior."
1,"Got this camcorder for christmas 3 yrs.ago.After storing the camcorder for about 1 yr. I charged the battery and when I went to check a tape that I had recorded 14 mos. ago there was no picture on the monitor and the viewfinder.I had sound but no picture.I called the JVC service division and they told me to ship it to them and they would check it out and tell me how much it would cost to fix it.I also went to an authorized JVC repair shop and was told that this was a problem that JVC had know about and that if I send it to the JVC that they would fix it for free.The JVC service division person I spoke to told me that I would have to pay.I am confused and very upset that JVC doesn't standby their product.If I have to by another camcorder,I'd never buy a JVC."
2,"I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says "" tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. "" or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?"
2,"I've been waiting for this one to come out on compact disc since I bought my first cd player. It is not that this is Lightfoot's best album - eight of the ten tunes are only good to mediocre. But the title track and ""If You Need Me"" are two of Lightfoot's best. I've been hanging on to a record player just to be able to hear ""If You Need Me."" Now, thankfully, I can send the record player down the garbage chute."
2,"Band's sole album, originally came out in 1970. This four piece, coming from Welsh, UK may just be another one of those 'better '70's lp's that you've never heard'. Tracks that (sort of) threw me for a loop were ""Freedom Train"", the foot-stomping ""Don't Wait"", the semi-Zeppelin like ""Eagle Song"", the well-played acoustic ""Time To Die"" and the title cut ""Women And Children First"". Personnel: Morty Mortimer-vocals, Graham Williams-guitar, Jack Bass-bass guitar and Dick Ferndale-drums. Mortimer and Williams had notably formed the band - Racing Cars several years later. Recommended for fans of Free, Uriah Heep, early Zeppelin and maybe Humble Pie"
1,"This is a good story along the lines of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordon"", with a slight variation. But the DVD quality of the Gotham release is horrible. The picture quality is almost unwatchable and the un-even mono sound has a steady hissing all the way through the movie."
1,"Many reviewers have commend that this book is poor in organization and explanation, I don't want to repeat. But one thing I would like to remind the potential buyers that this book includes all the past exam questions of FRM. I believe that it is the only attractive point of this book.But the explanation of the answers of the past questions are also not very good."
2,"You probably know how great it is, but i just wanna give you some tips:1.) Your PC might not support the akward 1400 X 900 res, but you can go online and download PowerStrip and it will add that res to your PC.2.) When playing on an XBOX 360 component, your cross-hairs will have a slight egg shape to them, and everything will appear a little taller than it should. If you don't have OCD, then it shouldn't be a ploblem.3.) Contrast sucks on Component.4.) Thinking about buying a PS3? you can still conect it to this monitor thingy by buying a HDMI to DVI adapter for $30 at monster.Can someone see if you can switch between DVI and VGA if you have them both plugged in?"
1,"I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
2,really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening
2,"I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
2,"My 10 year old daughter and my 61 year old butt can't get enough of Arular. Masterfully edited - as tight and rich as the Beatles at their peak. The dad loves the mechanical electronic aspects. The girl has to sing along with the singsong poetry and just dance to it.Maya's voice is awesome. My brother's reaction was that he doesn't like foreigh sounding funny voices in his music, so this isn't for everyone. But it's not just for open minded college students. This is the real thing. This is a most favored treat in our huge and eclectic music collection.As with other reviewers, we, too, are put off by the violent images, but for us it has the authentic feel of a window into the revolutionary third world."
2,"This is an excellent album and the music has surpassed my expectations of Clay Aiken. He gives out his heart and soul in each one the songs. This is one album that can put a smile on my face and it gives me joy. It is fun and spirit lifting to listen to this album, ""Measure Of A Man."" ""Invisible"" is my favorite with many others are running a close second. None are lower than a third place finish. I like it better and better each time I listen to it."
2,"I'm one of those people who says she wouldn't be caught dead with a romance novel. Imagine my surprise when a friend loaned this to me and told me it was a mystery, which she knows I love and I finally relized it was a romance! Julie Garwood lovingly developes her characters; she interests, involves and excties this reader and tells me a wonderful story. I ran right out and bought the ""prequel"" ""The Secret"" wherein we meet the Maitland clan and many of ""Ransom's"" characters. My note to Ms Garwood is, 'Please, please', take us home with Gillian Buchannan to the places and people she has not met, and keep us in touch with the Sinclairs and the Maitlands. A trilolgy would be such a joy!!"
2,"it's a simple game that plays quickly; no strategy involved, it's totally luck. Even older kids are willing to play it. Not a lot of educational value, except maybe learning to count objects up to 8 and learning to be a good sport."
2,"Even when i dont feel like working out i do because i remember how quick it is and makes me break a sweat, when i started i was sore for a a couple of days but i enjoy it, and can do this for life now all i need is a quick cardio"
1,"There is nothing good I can say about this movie.There is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining about it.If the main-characters didn't go by the names of Mario & Luigi, you'd be lost.Nothing here resembles the video-game it's based on, which isn't a bad thing neccessarily......except that nothing here resembles any kind of story.The acting is bad, perhaps on purpose......but who cares? It's not amusing in the slightest.The movie is boring. In 90 minutes, you'll want to gouge your eyes out.""Super Mario Bros."" -- the movie -- has been proven to damage brain-cells upon each viewing.In a Koopa-shell, don't waste your time on this movie. Don't even look at the cover. Don't even read this review. Just try and pretend this ""movie"" doesn't exist."
2,If you buy it then you should skip to the last two.Aeriths Theme and One Winged Angel in full orchestra alone is worth the price of this album.But if you are a real FF7 fan then I recommend that you take a look at the full collection.But if you don't have enough to spend then buy this one .The 3 songs are worth it and and some of the others are catchy if you relate them to the game.
2,"""Batman Begins"" is a five-star film. Don't forget it. But the 2nd disc, packaged only with the ""Deluxe Edition,"" is one of the most underwhelming ""bonus"" discs ever sold. Yes, Christian Bale's transformation into Batman is amazing, but he merely talks about it--we don't see much of his grueling eating and workout habits. There's some insight into the director and screenwriter's collaboration, but to get there you'll need to page through a maddening ""comic book"" interface. By the time I finished making it through the ""interactive"" DVD, I felt like Bruce Wayne after his parents were murdered."
2,"I love this dish. I try to keep from microwaving my baby's food, so I put really hot water in the base of this bowl. It warms my baby's food (even food from the fridge) and keeps it warm. As another reviewer said, the dish is very difficult to separate."
2,I loved this cookbook. My daughter is a vegan and I was concerned that she wasn't getting a balance of proteins in her diet. This cookbook really gives some great recipes from an author who has researched the foods and combinations that give a healthy diet without resorting to high starchy carbs. I will order it for myself as well even though I eat meat. It's always a good idea to include more vegie entres and go without meat as much as possible. I have cancer and am really looking into how diet influences health.
1,"I bought the book to help me understand someone who I feel has anger problems. After about two chapters, I determined it would not help me but decided to keep reading, hoping it would get better. For me, the book posed many causes of anger, but never did propose specific solutions. A lot of theories with no substance. I quit at page 178. I was able to tolerate the abundance of religious context, but when Dr. Carter put forth the proposition that criminal behavior is the result of environment rather than free choice, I closed the book forever."
1,"The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation."
2,"Timothy Hutton plays a Science Fiction author who, although he has written many novels, is best known for his first book about a song that haunted him. The song returns with a vengeance in the film and it is up to him to find a way to stop it from killing others. This was a nice tight thriller with fine acting by Hutton and David Kelly who may be familiar from Charlie and the Chocolate factory or Waking Ned Devine. It kept me guessing until the end (which is fairly hard to do). The background of beautiful Mediterranian locations make this a great movie to help escape from the summer heat."
1,"Actually, Taco Bell DOES sell ChocoTacos - I just had one myself! As a Mormon, I have to say that I found this book mildly amusing. The ""carefully hidden secrets"" about the founders of the church have never been hidden from me. There is nothing in Mormonism that is ""covered up"" - everyone is free, and encouraged, to learn as much as they possibly can! What the missionaries teach is the truth - the basic beliefs of the church. If you study them, the other controversial topics that come up have little relevancy to what we actually believe and what we practice. I have studied many religions and I've found that even among ""mainstream"" Christians there is a wide range of beliefs. It is the same for Mormons, and yet people are continually telling us what we do and don't believe! Really astounding when you think about it."
1,"The fixed unit is ok, but a folding utility knife is better. The sliding unit is junk. The blade does not stay in the knife. Easy to change the blade, but who cares if the blade won't stay put."
1,"This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across."
1,"There is no evidence of Clay's soul in this collection of songs, which was such a part of his performances on American Idol. This recording is a ""paint-by-numbers"" pop CD that is utterly boring and a huge disappointment. Clay has been stripped of his ""soul"" in this CD. His talents are completely lost on this endeavor and he is capable of truly fantastic performances."
1,"this is a good chart with good design. but one major problem....the chart is printed on three boards. however, with the fabrics in between the boards, the measurements end up being off!!! so your child will be measured a fraciton of an inch short! i am going to try to return it. if not, then i will need to tape the boards CLOSER together."
1,"You could do a lot better for the price of this tool. Comparing it to comprable models costing half as much? I recommend spending for the cheaper models or springing for something better. The blade wouldn't align with the blade guard until I modified the table with a file. The tightening bolt that runs through the fence stripped in less than two weeks of light use. (Trust me, I'm not THAT strong.) Spend less or spend more, just don't bother to spend for this tool. One additional note: I contacted the manufacturer about the stripped rip fence and they promptly sent me a replacement without questions. I suppose that's worth an upgrade to 2 1/2 stars. I still think one could do better for the money. Oh, and my saw leaks water continuously when the unit is operating. Better leave it at two stars afterall."
1,i am 9 years old.This Iz thing isent great .Once i tested it out and when u make a mix in DJ mode the IZ is (lol Iz and is)really making the music and u are just making a bubble sound.The only reson i really like it is becasue it makes songs from to ipod to hear out loud.I rather get a I-Dog if i were u.My mom said this thing would dance and i got very exieted.But it is the worst.
2,"I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."
1,"The movie has bad quality and bad sound. I have a sony blu ray player and i stream really high quality movies, but this movie was a bad experience."
1,"I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS CD AT BORDERS YESTERDAY AND I COULDN'T FIND IT. I REMEMBERD IT BEING LIKE 22 DOLLORS OR SOMETHING. SO I BOUGHT THE 35 DOLLOR COMPLETE 2 DISK RECORDING. I AM SOOOOOOO GLAD I DID. THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD SONGS THAT WERE ON THE COMPLETE CD THAT THEY TOOK OUT FOR THE HIGHLIGHTS. IF YOU REALLY LIKE EVITA AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A GOOD RECORDING, GET THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL BROADWAY OR THE CONCEPT RECORDING. I WOULDN'T BUY THIS OR EVEN THE ORIGINAL LONDON CD. THEY'RE JUST TOO SHORT."
2,"Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like ""I Got it Bad..."" ""Your Love Has Faded"" and ""Day Dream."" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."
1,"Don't waste your money on this one. It does not look like the photo. The product is uglier and thinner, and forget trying to comb or fluff the fur. It won't happen."
1,"As I see that, book have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of book, only comments like something as ""If you not understand it now, after all what you read, you need buy ""Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies... etc""- what really agressive advertising, make peoples feel scared, stupid and affraid and make them need buy more books from this publisher...Its scare my for a moment!Most helpful for my Peterson ASVAB, what have good explanation for ALL tests. I never not bui something ""for dummies"" again."
2,"I love this product. It is a light fragrance. I rated this product a 5 because it has a great smell and it was very cheap. If you buy this product out of Macy, you will spend more."
1,"It came damaged, I sent it back to be delivered in 2 to 3 days and still have not received a replacement. The last time I emailed him, he said he did not get it back and that was after 11 days. I think it was damaged before he even sent it and thought I would keep it because of Christmas, now he is just ignoring me. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I would like my money back plus what I paid for shipping twice."
1,not so great. She wanted to take it off every 2 seconds and it was a headache. I will be trying same brand different method.
1,"Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."
2,"I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it."
2,"I have kept trac of Clay since AI. I Cannot get enough of his new wave of music. He has a very unique voice and is very talented and pure. His voice shines and his personality only makes him more interesting. A bold approach by him to capture an audiance that is tired of the garbage that is being put out there by so called singers of now. He is showing that there is a huge market for a less blatent sexual market of music needed for a huge demogragraphic. But at the same time he captures the , can I say Hotness, that is there without being crude . I can see him going very far with a very needed new/old concept . Can I compare him with Frank Sinotra with a twist of new wave. He sings with a flair that from young to old, each drawing there own conclusions from his lyrics and making them their own feelings and meanings of each song as they perceive them."
2,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
2,"What a ride under water. After completing this book, one should read the mysterious island. This book gets faster as it races to the end."
2,Its a great movie for jumps and scares and the story is not that bad. I have a high end system and the audio is pretty awesome as it helps convey the Scary elements. The picture is good on my HD TV but not the best I've seen. Its a great movie to pop on a rainy night especially enjoyed on a good surround sound system!
2,"Gregg Braden has done vast research on the Essenes, a community committed to living according to spiritual laws in the time of Christ. He does a great job in carefully deciphering the power of prayer in their times and showing its unchanging nature with the ability to manifest even today. He writes of the importance of emotion and feeling the prayer; bringing it from the head into a matter of the heart. He talks of the possibility of living life in a prayer, which in fact is living a life in the space of continuous intentionality and co-creation with God. I found it to be an amazing book bringing home to me the importance of mindful living, of being present, aware. Of living in faith. I believe if one has truly embraced, incorporated - taken out of the intellectual mind - and encodified, better said, embodied its teachings, then one is living a transformed, powerful, God present life. I loved the book."
1,"This book is appallingly written, brazenly self-promoting and transparently biased to the left. It is full of cloying rhetorical questions (""They never shared their lunch with a starving Japanese child,"" supposedly characterizing younger Congressional Republicans -- how would Brokaw know who they'd shared lunch with, anyway?) and laughable self-contradictions (in a book that purportedly applauds the old-fashioned values, he criticizes Dole for being out of touch with the younger generation's self-absorption in his presidential campaign). Whenever he can work it in, he slings it to the Republicans, those meanies who care about no one but themselves. Critical thinkers will find this book superficial and opportunistic."
2,"You know you've seen a movie such as this too long when you're caught by your co-workers humming the Goofy Goober theme song. Frankly, I hate the Goofy Goober theme song but it's catchy and gets lodged in my cranium whether I want it to or not.The movie was pretty funny, my kids sure enjoyed it more than me. Dennis(the one Plankton hired to take out Spongebob and Patrick) was by far my favorite character. Tough and ruthless, he added a good counterpart to the craziness that is Spongebob and Patrick. Sort of reminiscent of the Tattletale Strangler ony edgier. And if you parents know what I'm talking about, you've probably seen too much of Spongebob as have I.The scene near the end with David Hasselhoff, well, I didn't really care for that. But most of the movie was enjoyable. For kids it's great. They'll watch it over and over."
2,"Nutritional Yeast is one of the absolute essentials of a Vegan lifestyle, in my opinion. This product provides that excellent, nutty, cheesy flavor in a great size package. I will be buying again!"
1,"I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches."
1,"Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!"
2,"This is simply the best R. Kelly. I don't care what lot of people think of 12 Play but this one beats it with no competiton. Chocolate Factory is hot too, but does not strike it like this one does. My favorite songs are:Feelin' On Yo BootyA Woman's ThreatR&B; ThugStrip For YouThis is a must have!!"
2,there wasn't enough romance though.I wish her books were longer
2,"For any man facing prostate cancer, this book should be one of the first read. The possibility of having the pain of prostate surgery replaced by a simple and relatively pain free freezing process is tremendously exciting. The additional benefits of retaining continence and erectile function are also very compelling. Good job Dr. Onik for advancing the cause of medical treatment for men everywhere."
1,I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did.
1,"First this review does not have to do with Pampers quality.... second, I can not believe that Amazon is selling this diapers for this price. Babies r us is much more expensive and they sell this package for 40 bucks. I do like Amazon but some items are extremely expensive.!!!!!! really really bad"
2,"Love the writing, the direction, of course the acting, special effects are off the hook, and the suspense is to die for.A bit too much self pity and martyrdom than I care for, but all in all quite exciting"
1,"This is a dreadful movie. Anybody who tells you that it resembles the show obviously hasn't seen one of them. The plot is like something you would find in a kid's story book, the graphics are from the Ren & Stimpy school of animation, and the characters don't sound the same even though they were done by the same people. This is surely enough to include SPONGEBOB on anyone's list of the worst 100 films of all time. Guess that means I need to see SANTA AND THE ICE CREAM BUNNY to see if in fact anything worse for kids was ever put to celluloid."
1,"I've been buying Pampers Baby Dry on Amazon for many months. The price is being increased every month on the same product with the same quantity. Unacceptable. I love the diapers, but will most likely be buying from somewhere else from now on."
2,"You will not be disappointed with the construction of the bike rack. It's made from very strong and light material that doesn't rust. It fit perfectly on my SUV. I placed 2 bikes on it and drove 70mph on the freeway without a problem. When I stopped to check the bikes, all the tie cables were still tightly fastened and both bikes were in proper placement.There are a couple of downsides however. You might find it difficult to place 3 bikes on there. Also if you own a women's bike, it will sit on the rack at an angle. When it sits at an angle, it makes it difficult to get the third clamp (stabilizer) fastened."
1,I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.
2,"I do jigsaw puzzles on a regular basis. This puzzle was part of a three-puzzle package at a special price. It is colorful, the picture is interesting. The pieces are of varying shapes. It is 500 pieces, rectangular with four borders. It was challenging for me without being terribly frustrating (I am not an expert at jigsaws, I just like to do them.) The pieces are on the small side. I enjoyed the process and may order from the company again."
1,this thing is a piece of crap.have to hold it so long it burns the hair. no don't buy this please. now this has nothing to do with the seller.
1,"They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
2,I gave this poncho as a birthday gift to my husband. He loves it so much he wears it while he watches TV. Of course he falls asleep wearing it! I recommend it highly.
2,"The gentle and effective manner of description, example, and exercises combined to nudge me into dealing with spiritual blocks (particularly effective was the forgiving exercise); her style helped me recognize the psychic already inside me and then nurture it into its first few stages of cognitive development. I don't know how many times, I inwardly responded with ""Oh, so that's why ..."". I cannot express how grateful I am that it entered my life and how grateful I am to Sonia for sharing herself so openly and lovingly."
2,"This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!"
2,"I first read this book as a young Christian and now am impressed with how many of the concepts I have adopted in my own creed. I detest pop Christian symbols and the urge to define a Christian by market forces. Schaeffer attempts to challenge the reader into not only glimpsing in the mirror, but to really make changes accordingly."
1,"I agree with the ""disappointing"" review and would add that the resolution of the mystery could have and should have been without the author's own agenda. To suggest that the Blessed Mother would actually call for murder, suicide, abortion, homosexuality and promiscuity in the priesthood is appalling! I would not reccomend this book to anyone and as I am a full time employee of a county library in an upscale community, I will tell our patrons to pass on this novel."
1,"The picture thru the tivo unit was fuzzy. Maybe the Tivo unit is not designed to receive antenna TV. The Tivo unit made all chanels come in fuzzy. Also I didn't like that you could not use any of the functions without a Tivo subscription, but it seems that without the monthly subscription the whole thing is useless. I am now very happy with a standard DVR that does not require a monthly subacription and works much like the old VCR used to do but without the tapes. The unit I ended up with is thebrite-View BV-980H Digital HD DVR (for Antenna and clear QAM use) ,with 320GB HDD Built-in, EPG Supported,Time Shifting - Black. However I do agree with the critiques of the Brite-View unit, there are some tricky quirks that take some getting use to."
2,This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.
2,"This is good stuff, but I'm still iffy on major differences in the noticeable effects on the ""outside"". I did great with NOW Foods ALA in regards to shifting fat off the parts of my body that I was exercising.With these types of products, one really has to be in tune to get the benefits. Some days, you just know that it's not working and some days it feels like I've wasted it... I take it intermittently now. I'm gaining some weight, but it doesn't look bad - which I attribute to this product. I can't afford the others, which is what I'm really getting at. I know that it's helping the free radicals for sure."
2,"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."
1,The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
2,What a great book. It's not amazingly written but the story is so engrossing it doesn't matter. I was completely enthralled the whole way through.
1,"I love history books and have read just about all the books in this series.This one was very weak. It starts out okay, but as you go along, it just becomes what other reviewers have noted - a very opinionated, biased piece. But even more than that, the book stops reading as history and more as narrative mishmash of events with the ever present biased commentary.I hate putting books down once started but it took me the better part of two years to get to the end of this. I could only take a few pages at a time and then I'd have to set it aside for a while.Anyway, all I can say is this was a major disappointment."
1,"Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here. And to prove it see the review by Ann Pate ""Annie Pate"". Kind of remind me of Yoko Ono selling John Lennon underwear, all you get is the name and dirty laundry. I will bet my bottom dollar that most people only read this because it was on Oprah's reading list."
2,"The book arrived before I expected and it made me happy because I would have more time to read it, before my book club meeting.I am half way thru the book but so far I enjoyed the book very much because being a C.S. Lewis book I thought it will be hard reading. Surprise! It Is Very Easy reading!"
2,Very well taken movie that depicts the sacrifices and passion required for medical profession. Background score goes very well with the movie.
1,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old for Christmas and all you have to do is touch it and the pieces fall off. Durability is not even a consideration for this toy. I have never wasted my money on a worse toy than this. I really wanted the other bat cave listed but it is out of production...scary thing is that this is what they replaced it with. Do yourself a favor, don't waste the money I did!!!!"
2,"I am a Speech Therapist and this is a toy that the children with whom I work (3,4, and 5 year olds) ask for over and over again. They just love it! I have the small travel one which is perfect since I travel all around for my job. If the child is too afraid to push the teeth down I give him/her a tongue depressor or my pencil so the crocodile bites that instead of the child."
2,I buy these for my two yr old and they work great. Great price great size great diapers! These diapers are made a little bigger so they fit small and bigger babies.
1,"For 14 months this product worked great. Then it died. It was not dropped or otherwise abused. TIVO's response was that they would replace it for the cost of buying a new one.Even though it broke so quickly, TIVO is worth the price we payed for the box and the service. If the cable companies could come out with a DVR that was as capable I would rather rent it knowing that if it broke it would be replaced for free.The box itself is rather bulky for the electronics that are actually inside it. The unit could have been designed a little better to make the overall size smaller.Hopefully you get a better box than we did."
1,"I hated the ending of the book, it was awful and depressing. I thought it was going to turn out better!"
1,"I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it.The cheap cologne smell is inescapable. Wash your face with this stuff and you'll be smelling it all day.I popped the top and smelled it at the store, but after using it the smell is much stronger."
2,Easy gift to give and long lasting read! My son-in-law really likes this one so much that we got it for him again.
1,"Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
1,"Um, hello? Has anyone noticed that this woman doesn't know how to sing? Most songs are an over-baked litany of melodramatic metaphors that add up to ... what? Others appear to be some sort of short story told in the past tense. All are whisper-talked by the artist in her faux Gallic/Brit accent that wears poorly as the CD progresses. The few times when the producers require her to actually hit a note are cringe-inducing.I wanted to like this record and spent $15 of hard-earned cash on it. But I guess there's a good reason why she's only dragged out of storage every ten years."
1,"A little over a week of use, I noticed a bad diaper rash that rapidly progressed to blisters. They healed when I switched to a different diaper and broke out again when I tried to go back to using this diaper. I'm giving two stars because pampers agreed to refund my money even though I was outside the week window to return them to Amazon and because according to Pampers, this is the same formula they have been using for 20 years, which means they were my favorite diapers for my daughter."
2,These pajamas are very comfortable. I wash them in the machine with cold setting and have no problems with how they come out.Good buy!
1,"Made for kindle fire,however words too small to read and they don't blow up like other children's books. I do not recommend"
2,"The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
1,"Well, let's not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible movie. Being an Air Force veteran, I like movies with planes, old and new, but I have to tell you this wasn't one of them. Acting was poor for the most part, historical aspects, well they get a grade of F-, including the planes, and supposed time period. All wrong. I usually like to watch a movie, and enjoy it, without analyzing it, but this one was different, and I could not help myself. I kept hoping it might get better, but no luck. So, Nothing ventured, Nothing gained, and I would not recommend this film to anyone! Period! Adios!"
2,"wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going ""wow"".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it."
2,Whoa! This movie literally took my breath away. Its fast paced the whole time never letting up. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing. Forget the VHS get the DVD its cheaper and has extra scenes and interviews. The plot is like nothing ive ever seen before. Buy this and you won't regret it.
2,"1984 On september the 6.th someone said that Orwell never read, and therefore was not inspired by ""We"". That is not true. I have got a rewiew of ""we"" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times."
2,One of the best books I've ever read and everyone should read it to clear up any misconceptions they have regarding any of the cases mentioned in the book. I refer to it often when one of the cases pops back into the news or I hear a new theory regarding any of the cases.
1,"It did not pick up the DSL signal from my AT&T High-speed Internet service. I had to return it and get a 2Wire, which AT&T officially supports and which works without any problems."
1,"The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."
2,"My husband and I both enjoyed this helpful dvd to better prepare us for the ""BIG"" day. We were not able to go to an actual birthing class because of his work schedule. There are a lot of reviews complaining about how the birthing instructor isn't very funny and somewhat cheesy, but it's really not all that bad. We both found her to actually be humorous in most parts. This dvd is very easy to understand and is great, especially for new parents like us. I def recommend it, and also, if you have netflix, you can rent it instead of buying it. But it's dvd by mail only, not instant streaming."
2,Just to inform you that we have great taste in music from England too. This is truly a wonderful album. Not one song dissapoints and all the tracks showcase Clay's fantstic vocal abilities. I may have had to import this CD from the American site but beleive me it was well worth it. This guy has serious talent and it will not be long before he is the big international star that he deserves to be.
1,"I'll admit it: I'm a Spongebob junkie. I've seen almost all of the episodes, multiple times. I saw this movie when it came out in theatres with a fellow Spongebob freak. Gosh, we were like 15 and we did not even care.That being said, I did not care for this movie. The writers make great 12-minute episodes, but apparently nothing good comes from trying to make longer plots. It also has some disturbing parts for younger kids, so I don't even let my niece watch it when it comes on TV. She's a big fan of the episodes as well.All in all, stick with the original shows."
1,"Really mediocre romantic comedy featuring a brown-haired Helen Hunt before Mad About You and As Good As It Gets, Kelly Preston before her career surge, and Andrew McCarthy on the downside of his Brat Pack run. Shows up occasionally on cable, and best left there."
1,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to spend a fortune on the book for school. Well this Kindle edition is so abridged, I found I didn't read half of the play. Don't waste your dollar. Find another version of this play."
1,ok product if you only need it for a year or so. Mine stopped working and will not power on. Many similar complaints online.
2,"Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride."
2,"My daughter loved these dvds so much, we have ordered every set, not to mention it comes with a figure."
2,"Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works! I tried it from 25 feet away and through one wall and the remote turned my device on and off without a hitch!"
2,"In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening."
1,"I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two."
1,"I have been shopping for a new VCR since both of my much older ones died (within a month of each other!). My Toshiba and my RCA, both made it to about 8 or 9 years old. In doing the shopping math - my old VCR repairman kept admonishing me to stay away from the Sony - good TVs and other electronics, but VCRs are not their forte, he said. In doing so, I found he was right, as also evidenced by the other reviews from guests. My VCR repairman would know, he repairs what can't be returned! So, now I'm looking at Panasonic and RCA. Thanks to all of you who tried to warn me - I'll get over my system not being totally Sony. I had to learn the hard way though.... still, why can't Sony make a VCR that works quietly?"
2,The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together working on a ranch. Their goal is to earn enough moeny to live out their dream. It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other. Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him. This book is a great book that shows how very different personalities can get along. I fully recommend this book by John Steinbeck.
1,It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.
2,"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing."
1,"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."
1,"Most Clay fans are buying from 2 - 10 copieseach to help boost his sells! This isunfair giving us a false number of peopleactually buying! But how else can theykeep him in that number one spot withthat slop! Yeah,he's number one all right!A one star rating!!!!"
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book."

2,"The sheer nobility of the 'Presentation of the Rose' scene and the trio of the three excellent sopranos toward the end of the opera brought tears to my eyes. Those two scenes alone are worth the DVD price, but equally good are the Baron's voice and his appearance. In fact, there's not a mediocre voice in the opera that I can put a finger on. The orchestra performs quite well; it's a pleasure to watch the conductor's virtuosic movements.All in all, a great team work. A winner CD even for a non-opera fan."
2,"This is a terrific oral history of the show. Gives you a sense of how it got off the ground, the insane competition for performers and writers to get sketches into the show, and gossipy stuff like politics, obnoxious hosts, and drug use. Reflections on the deaths of Belushi, Gilda, Farley, and Hartman are tremendously moving. I started this book at about 9:00 p.m., did not put it down until 6:30 a.m. the next morning."
2,"I had few problems installing these units on two different PC's. The CAPWIZ is somewhat flakey (V2.0) at timesand requires exiting and reentering the CAPWIZ program.I found this utility to work the best with the unit inplace ofthe Video Studio. Unit does a fine job in the capture process andcreates a presentable MPEG1 (SVCD,MPEG1,MPEG2)..I Found VCD resolution encoding to be less than ideal,"
2,It is a wonderful story of a girl who is very layed back and careless. My class read it together and I coldn't put it down. This is the only book where we would ask for homework to read the next chapter. I think everyone in my class loved the book. I felt like I was there through the whole book. I could picture the courthouse where Kit was pleading for her freedom. I was very scared when the large town group came to Hannah's home to burn it down. I was a great book and if you are thinkiing about buying it I think you should.
2,I love the story very close to the comic book. I like the price I paid for it. It is a good buy.
1,Bought this for my wife to replace an old cup warmer she had that died. She was totally disappointed with the product. It was not effective at keeping coffee in her mug warm.
1,"Willie Williams and his fraternity brothers from ""the University"" (Stanford thinly disguised) go through the second world war and return to pick up their lives. Their problems are as expected: the cold war, the Vietnam War, their alienated offspring, and -- par for the course for Drury -- latent homosexuality among some of the brothers and marital problems (usually boredom and the greener grass syndrome) among most of the others. Trite as it sounds, the book will entertain you, especially if you formed an attachment to this group whom Drury first introduced in ""Toward What Bright Glory"". Even though it is a distinctly mid brow read, chances are if you start it, you'll hang on until the not so surprising end."
2,"I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. She loves this set and I love the pictures she makes!"
1,"positives:1 christian bale is the best batman to date2 morgan freeman is in itnegatives:1 the movie is from start to finish: horrible2 no plot3 once again, they throw in a couple of bat-villains in poor undeveloped fashion4 katie holmes is fuggly5 morgan freeman is too smart to be in movies like this6 you have to pay at this point to see this movie...wait until it graces the rarefied air of hbo and you'll thank me because you can change the channel to underwaterbasketweavingweaveoff2005 or just go to sleep in your la-z-boy (anything is better than this snooze fest)seriously though i can't believe how bad this movie was"
2,"My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. They said it must have been good because I did everything perfectly. I would highly recommend this DVD!"
1,"This costume is poorly cut. Areas through the bust/underarms bunch up and won't lay flat. I have an average build -- not flat, and not busty (35 B/C). I ordered an XS. But while the waist fit, the bust area was tight and dug into the underarms."
1,"Ray Bradbury tries to write a bestseller in this boring novel. He keeps the audience in the book for about three pages, then everyone falls asleep. If he could do it again, I think he should have never written books in the first place."
1,"I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
1,"For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 years old and now he's 5 and won't use any other swing set. I thought he would like a wooden one that was bigger, but he gets so much enjoyment from this one and it's durable, was easy to assemble (even for my husband) and he gets hours of enjoyment from it. We did anchor it into the ground because I was afraid it would tip over as he got older, but it works just fine and we're all happy, even mom!"
2,"David has a baby left on his doorstep and when he goes to the local department store to buy baby supplies, he meets shy-moussy Marissa who is dressed in a story book costume. David needs a nanny and thinks Marissa would be perfect,he offers her a lot of money and she takes the position. Soon David sees the sexy woman under the shy exterior and before long sparks are flying. Of course, his reputation as a womanizer doesn't help his suit. This is one of my favorites in the Texas Cattleman's series."
2,"This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!"
1,"I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring. Unless you're interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism, avoid this book."
2,easiest thing in the world. unwrap it - plug into USB port - and Tivo begins downloading programming immediately. My wife loves me
2,"I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."
2,"I had to read my mice and men in 8th grade. So it would be easier, I got the book on tape. It was easier indeed. Of mice of men is one of the best books that i have ever read. I think that it is great the relationship between Lennie and George. And how the other's character just fit into the book. I would totally recomend this book to ANYONE"
1,"Sorry, I couldn't get into this one at all. If you want to read some GOOD thrillers located in Bangkok, try John Burdett's books beginning with Bangkok 8."
2,Experienced no problems with the order. The book came within the estimated delivery date. The book matched the description given.
2,"everything was WONDERFUL. I did, however, receive it a day late, which was problematic for my class. BUT nonetheless, I was very happy."
1,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
1,The book is about two guys going from field to field for jobs. George is a small man that protects Lennie. Lennie is a very big man with the mind of a child. The story takes place on a field in California. I disliked the book because to me it was stipid. George is always yelling at Lennie and telling him what to do. Then what George does to Lennie at the end is sad and mean. you would need to read the book yourself to make a decision on it.
1,"I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"
2,"It is easy in this day of age to forget about the troubling aspects that are still facing public schools in our large cities. With this book, Jean Anyon does not let us forget the problems that are still facing these schools today. This book provides a different and important perspective on public school reform in this nation. Anyon does not jump to blame the schools, teachers and students like is done so often when schools fail, but rather she portrays how cummulative effects of school and public officials decisions have tied the hands of the public education reformers in those cities. Anyon's ideas are more comprehensive, and she does not want to just change the schools, but the city itself. This book is very compelling and insightful and offers a great look inside the doors of the public school system in our urban environment."
1,"Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his ""favorite book ever"". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."
1,"I can only imagine two things: either this singer is mocking retarded people (because he sounds like one), or this is Kermit The Frog singing with his nads being squeezed so tight he's a soprano! I think the kids in Hanson sang better than this-didn't they???? lol. Anyone who takes this band seriously should be locked in a room with Michael Jackson for a month: showers not included. On the other hand, this band is so funny to listen to, you might want a copy to keep around for when your friends are over and you're partying: this could have EVRERYONE on the floor rolling in laughter by midnight! Big Zero waste of time and money ... A 10 ZERO RATING."
2,"Got this so I could start performing again(drag queen)and have put on a few pounds around the mid area, I didn't want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy. Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits, Works great and like they say pain is beauty, and this is so worth it."
1,"I bought these because I had a really good deal. Unfortunately, the deal was too good to be true. My daughter consistently pees out of the front when she wakes up in the morning. During the day, these diapers are fine because she lets us know when she has peed. I wouldn't put them on at night. They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns. I would use these at daycare or in the diaper bag because you can get 5-6 diapers in a small bag. Right now, I would rank generic diapers from HEB (I live in Texas) better than Pampers."
1,"From reviews I had thought RB would be a genuine thriller.The only thing I found thrilling was the realization after anhour or so that the film would soon be over. Can't understand why anyone would make the effort to mentally get into this film.I found it corny and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay for the DVDthat I watched. Everything about this film was heavy - heavy acting, heavy scripting. Heavy,heavy, heavy."
1,This is not worth the price. Used it once and had to re-inflate it five times. Does not hold air. A piece of junk.
2,"Good price but no wet indicator. It's thinner than the new diapers with wet indicator. Would have preferred to have the indicator, but for the price it's not bad"
2,For me it was very good to know about the soldiers who went to the war in VIETNAM. They know a lot about it because they were there for a long time.
1,"It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could read an entire novel. For example, The ""Romance of Lust"" selection doesn't do its author justice. The original is a big book, wherein the author couldn't possibly have held a job anywhere since he devoted his entire day to erotic diversions. No one was safe, not even his aunt and sisters. Well, maybe the family dog. Other selections were uninteresting too. Is the editor really a Major? Why do we need his military rank in such a book? Is he still in active duty???"
1,"I ordered Constantine and got another DVD instead. I shipped back Constantine at shippers request. Haven't received Constantine yet. Please credit my credit card as it's been to long. I no longer want the DVD.Thanks, Al Pins"
2,My family got new phones for Christmas. They all needed cigarette lighter adapters and I wasn't going to pay ALLTEL's prices for an off brand product. I got the real Motorola deal and for just a few dollars.Great product!
2,"A great collection of really quite original tunes, with a couple of superb ballads.Thank God I stumbled on to this band, they give a rare sense of hope to modern experimental music."
2,"if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. this one fit the bill and fits [tightly] in my stabilla 8' case with a level."
1,"This movie is full of a bunch of slow moving character developments. There's a bunch of long dialogues between men and women that are very drab and superficial. People tell me to watch this film for the amazing jump cut edits...well I did and big deal. Let's face it this guy is no Scorcese when it comes to doing innovative stuff with the camera, writing compelling scripts, and getting a likable cast up on the screen. Personally I think this guy just writes films for film school types and completely ignore us the audience."
2,"I bought this to replace and older USB wireless adapter which I broke. This one works fine with my series 2 Tivo. Hooked up easily, no problems. Better quality reception!"
2,Follow John Carter's son Carthoris on his first adventure in the series. It was a quick read for me that left me looking forward to the next book.
1,"Don't be decieved with this candle burning book. This is not traditional candle burning, it's new age nonsense. Theres one simple test you can use to determine wether a book is reliable. The author has chosen to use the ""k"" spelling of magic making it magick. This ""K"" spelling was invented by aliester crowley, a drug adict and mental case. It has nothing to do with candle burning with the psalms. This book is new age rubbish and should not be considered authentic or practical. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking magic should be spelled with a k."
1,"Personally I thought this book was dried out and boring. I had to read this book for my English class and I did not enjoy it. It seemed like it took 50 pages to tell about how the character was hungery. I am no expert in novels, but I have read plenty of more enjoyable and worthwhile books. On a good note, there was a lot of interesting facts on whaling, sailing, and survival. I probably enjoyed learning all the facts more than the storyline itself."
2,"My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. We decided on this one, and although the 'teacher' was a bit corny it was helpful. I especially liked that you could fast forward and skip parts! All in all it was a worthwhile purchase and proved helpful to us both."
2,"This CD is absolutely great. They have some great full sounding tracks. I had heard a few songs on the radio, and so I bought the CD and absolutely loved virtually every song on the CD.Also had a chance to see these guys in concert, and personally thought they were better live than on the album. Dont pass up a chance to buy the album or see them live!"
2,"This item is very well built, and works great with the Nikon Camera it was purchased to support. I recommend this item."
1,"This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special. Save your money and treat yourself to a Big Mac meal. It will go down easier than the characters in this movie."
2,"Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
1,I don't understand how a DVD that hasn't been released yet has received so many reviews-all of them great. Has this DVD been released elsewhere?
1,"This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Buy a good game like Golden Sun, Wario Land 4, Spyro season of ice, Crash Bandacoot, and Sonic Advance. If you buy it get it for a different gameing platform. Never buy a game after a book or movie for Gameboy Advance I bought Harry Potter for Computer and my friend bought it for Gameboy Advance and I was amazed at how much better the game was for computer. So I highly suggest that you do not buy this game for Gameboy Advance."
1,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
1,"Adopting the story of operation ""Mincemeat"" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined."
1,"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
1,The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
2,This is so easy to use and keeps your laptop from overheating.I used this while I was laid up from knee surgery and it was great to be able to keep my leg up while continuing to work from home. Love it!
1,"I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever."
2,My brother in low loved them. He added them to his Tybo boxing gloves to give extra weight on his arms.
2,"Yes. Yes. I know. This was not the book. You are right, it was not. Not even close. Just think of it as a different author telling a different story, in a different format, using familiar characters.The story and adventure were good.The action was exciting.The production was good.For a family film, it is worth keeping around."
2,"Prompt shipment and book is as ordered. Good customer service, would order from this source again."
2,If your looking for a great book that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. A great place to start be it a beginner or old timer this is a must read. David Kenik not only wrote well but put it in a format that is understandable. Well thought out! This is a must have book for anyone who wants to understand what is needed to justify an armed response. It does not replace personal training or what can be learned in a class (interaction). It does however build a great foundation for what is needed to to understand in responding with lethal force. If you own a firearm for personal protection than you need to own this book.
1,"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
1,"F*** You, Geffen, F*** You Courtney Love!!!! Dave Grohl why didn't you STOP THEM, YOU WERE MY HERO... WHAT HAPPENED DAVE????? My God, it has come to this..."
1,"I had to read this book for my 9th grade English class and i must say this is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life! it had the worst ending possible, I had to keep putting it down because it had the slowest plot in the world and had very flat characters. (Amazon suggests you buy this with To kill a Mockingbird which was the other book that was required for me and I highly suggest that book because it is a great book and one of my all time favorites.) AHHHHH!!!!! this book made me soo mad. They killed of my favorite character!!! and george did it how could he do that! Slim was my other favorite and so was candy but even Slim wasn't cool in the end. I hated this book so much. Don't read this its bad. Read to Kill a Mocking Bird its good. If you want to read something of John Steinbecks read the Grapes of Wrath."
1,"Wife didn't have any luck with this product. Much more luck with the fenugreek. She also claimed this tasted like ""goat ass."" She has a way with words. The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain. That and the taste of goat ass that you can't wash away makes this a lowsy product."
2,Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
1,"I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
1,"This single, and most likely (though it saddens me to say it) the album from which it originates [Always Outmanned...], is dissapointing. This statement is only for those who love Experience and feel that the Prodigy peaked with Music For the Gilted Generation--folks who were introduced to the Prodigy via Fat of the Land will probably love it. It's got plenty of ...slurred ""singing"" by Keith Flint and mediocre beats that compliment it very well. I've been waiting many years for signs of a return to the powerful, compelling, and complex beats of old, and it looks like I might have to just give up. My catalogue of 15+ Prodigy lps and eps might not be getting any new friends any time soon."
1,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
2,"This book is perfectly delightful. I purchased this for my husband, and he has spent hours pouring over it. The pictures are wonderful and very high quality. He swears I bought it because so many pictures are of him in trouble at the golf course (not true!), but loads of laughs."
1,"a friend of mine had said this book was ab-soul-lutely stunning, and i'm disappointed to say it was anything but. The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book."
1,"I thought this CD was bad. This CD almost out beat my least favorite CD that I have (Darwin's Waiting Room). I only liked ""Stick um up"" and ""Wierdo"" the rest of the CD is just a bunch of giberush & swaring. I suggest you don't get this CD it's a waste of money."
1,Sure this is an interesting book. Unfortunately the copy we received was written in spanish!
1,"I have watched this show from day one and boy was I disappointed with the Series Finale, what a crappy job they did with the finale. I wish I would not have wasted my money on this one.Just me SD"
2,"I got the collection in pristine condition today. I haven't stopped laughing since I put the collection on my CD changer. It's an amazing collection from George's early ""Dirty Hippie"" era. If you love George, like I do, then get this collection. It will not disappoint you, I promise!"
1,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more with hers than the actual movie does, giving her character a sense of dignity and grace despite of the lousy dialog, Badly written characters and insane plot cliches that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Her performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for Dvd."
1,"I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone."
1,"The movie is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. However, the grainy gooey VHS-like picture quality can only be attributed to a very poor and shoddy transfer by KINO."
1,"If this isn't ueless, it's certainly misleading. Read the previous review, and don't bother downloading it for your Kindle."
2,"I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!"
2,"This CD is amazing! As if Clay's voice wasn't sensational enough, you can really tell how hard he's been working on these songs. You would think he's been professional his whole life! This CD is a must have. Clay is the American Idol."
1,The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.
1,"I purchased this product to help eliminate my mild acne, and used it in conjunction with MDSkincare's cleanser/toner, and tinted moisturizer. I have 4 days left of my 30 day supply and have seen no improvement in my acne, or noticable improvement in overall skintone. Actually, I am now breaking out in places I've never had probelms with before. I will try Perricone products next, the MDScincare pads seemed to be a waste of $75 for me."
2,"Bought this for my dad as a birthday gift and sent it to him. He has not received it yet, but I an sure he will love it."
2,I recently took this on my last camping trip. Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary. What was useful was the light that gave me a bright led that helped keep my tent lit when getting ready for bed. When I did try out the fan I was impressed by the air that came thru. Although my experience is more with the light I would say this is a necessary purchase for anyone taking a camping trip.
2,"My kids (kindergarten & first grade) love the Songs 4 Life kids ""Light your World."" The songs are easy to sing along with and the know many of the songs. I found the tempo a little repetitive but I was impressed with the kids' ability to sing along."
2,"As a Catholic I guess I could be offended by the ""third secret"",however I chose to believe that most of the church standings on most issues are man made, not God inspired. I remember as child waiting anxiously for the revelation of the ""third secret"", when it was announced by John Paul 11 I was disappointed, I expected more........and that is how the story goes.I have read all 3 of Steve Berry's books and this is by far his best. But before you get all bent out of shape this, this is just a story, a work of fiction. I really enjoyed it and lovers of historical fiction will too."
2,"I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!"
1,This book is about lotteries and the systems she uses. None of them help you win the lotteries. I've tried to use this book and her software to win. Dont waste your money on her books and the software they sell. None of them will help you win lotteries. People make money off you. If their books and software worked they wouldnt be selling it. They'd be super rich winning the lottery all the time and hiding in the hills with all their money.
2,"Received from amazon within few days of ordering the product, though it was standard free super saving shipping. I'm using pampers baby dry for my elder one till he was completly potty trained. And now I have started buying baby dry for my little one who is 1 month old. Its so comfortable and keep's my babies bottom dry."
1,"I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such)."
1,"Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending."
2,I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!
2,"Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series."
1,"This knife is terrible. It was cheap, so I should have been dubious about quality. Save your money for a better knife since you can easily cut yourself with this knife. It's made of cheap plastic and soft metal parts, so don't count on the blade locking properly. It's an insult to even have a fire fighter logo. Don't make the same mistake in buying this poorly constructed tool."
1,"... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood."
1,"My son wore these off and on for a month when school started. Both shoes, the soles started to come off. The right one came off almost completely. Don't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I wouldn't order these particular Converse shoes again."
1,"CoF perfected the art of music for disconsolate, moody, maladjusted (""Goth"") teens to commit suicide by. We can only hope more of 'em do -- the world's gene pool quite obviously needs a good scrubbing. It's easy to understand the attraction of this dreck -- it's atmospheric, kind of like elevator music in Dm, Dani Filth is an atrociously horrible singer, and their Edward Gorey meets soft porn cover art doubtlessly appeals to the latent Anglophile that lurks 'neath the heart of every American. (And come to think of it, some of Dani's lyrics are as awful as Byron or Shelley's worst prattlings.) CoF is amusing from a socio-cultural perspective, but musically they have all the integrity of Billy Ray Cyrus or Mariah Carey."
1,"I'm a Pampers fan! From Swaddlers to Cruisers to Baby Dry. But when my daughter moved up to size 5, the pamper leaks at night. She is a soaking mess in the morning. And the soaking is the particles in the diaper. The diaper literally falls apart. I bought one case and it's is almost finished thankfully. Back to Cruisers we go!"
1,"I love swaddlers, so after finally getting to the end of the initial stash of pampers from the baby showers etc, I started purchasing them. They cost more than other diapers, but oh well I was hooked.I got the grand idea in my head that ""Oh, baby dry? they must work even BETTER than swaddlers, DRY is right in the name!""Wrong. In a swaddler my kid could pee 2-3x and no leakage. In the baby dry, I don't know what it is about them, if she got to peeing a second time? Good lord get that thing off of her quick or she's going to leak or please no zues, oprah, or a tiny baby jesus, don't let her poop because it IS coming out the back even if I have her in a size too big without the back rolled down.I ened up using these as Daycare diapers, because there she got changed ever hour (No worries, I usually check her ever 2 hours max or at the first whiff of poop at home but that wasn't enough for baby dry)Not ever getting those things again and if they're gifted I am regifting."
1,"In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight."
1,"I ordered Foundation and Earth on July 28, 2010. I received the wrong book (Foundation and Empire) on August 6, 2010 and immediately notified the sender who said they would ship a replacement out immediately. It is now August 29, 2010 and I have still not received the book I ordered. I understand the book I ordered was ridiculously inexpensive, but that doesn't justify terrible service. If you could get the wrong book to me within a week, I don't understand why the correct order couldn't have been here within a week, though since you made the mistake I believe it should have been expedited. Very disappointed and still awaiting the book. Contacted seller a week ago and they said they could confirm it has been dispatched, but I still have not received it."
2,"With the coming of my twins, I had to save as much as I can. So I used cheaper diapers...but soon even with putting generous amount of diaper rash cream every change, diaper rash came in red, raw pimple-like bumps and even bleed. I decided to change and use pampers and was amazed at how quick the rash was gone. Pampers diaper is lightweight and breathable. Very good for the nite especially if the baby can sleep through. Won't leak."

1,"I love the features of this rice cooker. It cooks and re-heat brown rice very well.I purchased the rice cooker last summer and have been used it every day. Yesterday, I noticed that two small spots on inner non-stick layer was chipped. The non-stick outer layer started to chip earlier. I can not believed it happened to this expensive rice cooker that is made in Japan."
1,"Home for Christmas. Sounds innocent enough. But you would be well advised to stay away from this home. It is a horrible place. You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd. Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate. How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes. But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must. After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!"
1,"that can't decide whether it's a murder mystery or a parody of one. Each character has a < gasp! > song, each worst than the last. Its message is the women in any man's life will drive him crazy. Sure, the eight women here are the best that French cinema has to offer, though Catherine Deneuve is a bit of a dumpling despite being typecast as a closet ""Sapphist."" But the movie's unit setting is more typical of stage than cinema. And it drags, horribly. You might find its compendium of French insults interesting. But if you don't, it's just a director stringing cliches together to abuse both art & audience. Probably not worth your time, and certainly not worth your trouble."
1,"This is Oasis at there worst.....This album is just too horrid, Bad lyrics, boring songs, same sounds, nothing new. Amazing that a talaented Noel Gallager would make an album like this. This a;bum i sjust to overplayed and it is also plagued with too much solos. There are solos, and too much solos. Noel over does it on the solos. The guitar playing is not that good in this album, it has no stand-out tracks, and needs more unique, not mainstream. Oasis' new album lacks everything there past albums had."
2,"Two of Frankie Laine's great albums with Johnny Williams are reissued on one disc- to excellent effect! Although the arrangements and style of these 60s albums resemble Laine's and William's work on ""Hell Bent for Leather,"" in this case the songs are not cowboy songs, but, in the case of ""Dueces Wild,"" gambling songs, and, in the case of ""The Call of the Wild,"" klondike-adventure songs. No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine's success, and it's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as ""Call of the Wild"" and ""Roving Gambler."" Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine's image: Johnny Horton's ""North to Alaska"" comes to mind. Some may find these selections and arrangements trite and old-fashioned- and they are- but the sheer strength and passion exhibited here is hard to dislike."
2,This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots.
1,"This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world. This book has no value except to make you laugh at how far some people would go to pretend that it could be interpreted. There are better wastes of ones time, for example staring at a blank wall."
1,"We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling."
2,"I'm researching how a housewife would have lived during the Civil War era. Although The American Frugal Housewife edition that I read for free on my Kindle was from the 1830s, much of it probably remains unchanged 15 to 20 years later. People in villages or living in the country at that time would still have stored their foods for winter in the same way as this book advises. The treatments for croup, a burn or other illness give insight into the hardships encountered when there were few doctors and the family had to self-treat as much as possible.Fascinating details of a bygone era that is particularly useful to me as I work on my book about my Civil War ancestor."
2,"I love all the Sister Fidelma stories, and these short story anthologies are particularly interesting. I'm building quite a collection on my Kindle."
1,"I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews, however, these made me so nauseous and sick. i don't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel. It might have just been a reaction to my system, and my system only....but i'm throwing my box away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o("
1,The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.
2,"I really hate how it seems that everytime a metalcore band is starting to hit their stride they go ahead and break up. Deadguy, Kiss It Goodbye, Spread the Disease, Botch...etc. The list goes on and on. Maharahj is on that list too and its a shame for they are probably the very best of all gone-before-their-time metalcore bands. Their debut album is packed end to end with all of that uber-technical yet strangely listenable chaotic noise that fans of this stuff love and Maharahj do it better then just about everyone with few exceptions. They improved on their second album Repetition to a point of near perfection but this album is still more then worth picking up."
1,"I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
2,"DVD boxed set of CSI season 3, very high quality video for a DVD. Hardly notice the difference when playing back on a HDTV. 5.1 surround sound does not really work well for a TV series, sometimes the dialogs are softer than the background or effects making the story quite hard to understand, especially when there is no subtitles to go along."
1,Buy a roll of scotch tape. Cheaper and same effect. Was a total waste of money. I was so disappointed.
2,"What I like about this book is its brevity. It teaches the same things as the other metaphysical books, but with fewer words. Examples would be like the acronym F.E.A.R., false evidense appearing real; what you think about expands; staying positive and removing limiting beliefs by replacing them with a corresponding empowering belief. Example would be ""I am a good speller"" instead of ""I am a bad speller."" If you don't want to wade through thousands of words on metaphysical truths but would rather have the short, abridged version of metaphysical self help, then buy this. Also Maxwell Maltz's book called Psycho-Cybernetics which I think was published back in 1960 would be a good complement to this one."
2,"Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before."
2,"Start to finish, it's like Judas Priest on steroids and a singer that is so over the top on his highs it's like a banshee having a seizure. The music is heavy, catchy and intricate and his vocals soar over it all making it ten times more intense and fun, yes fun to listen to. Some disagree and think his vocals are TOO OTT but it all comes down to personal opinion. It's like a metal opera that is very dramatic. It can go from vengeance to a very emotional state from song to song and it takes you on a journey. You know those crazy Italians. They're intense in everything they do and it is all over this cd. I bought this purely because I thought the cover was ridiculously awesome. I mean, a centurion holding a pump action sawed off shotgun? Sold."
1,I did not find this book to be helpful & my IVF nurse laughed and told me to get a refund when I showed it to her.
1,"[Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier."
2,the quality of this is very good. only problem is that i wish the battery would last longer. lasts about 4 hours
2,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is one of the best. It has lasted over a century, having been published in 1901. If you haven't read it, do so today--there haven't been many changes in detective fiction in the last hundred years.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,"I would recomend this to any system of a down fan or any rock fans, it has great songs, my 3 favorites on it are Toxicity, Chop Suey, and Prison Song."
1,Gabrielle Anwar's uneven (and thus fake sounding) English accent fades in and out during this inane movie with a flimsy premise - four rowing buddies decide to share responsibility for the child carried by a woman they all lust for but promised never to pursue (and some don't remember sleeping with). This cheesy movie appears to be a really bad made-for-cable TV movie that miraculously has everyone getting their happy little ending.More miraculous is that it was made in the first place or that any of the actors are entertaining additional acting offers.
2,"Well, the game is ok, as long as you don't want to finish it. Most of the game is just wandering around pointlessly to find things and getting lost a lot. The major problem is that at one point Gimli is invisible when you need to talk to him and the fact that every single game freezes up when you try to leave Moria. Other than that it's well.... ok for being Lord of the Rings merchandise."
2,"I bought this for distributing family videos. Since this camera contains a IEEE 1394 adapter, it's very simple to transfer video to a computer. It has lived up to it's promises."
1,"It's an interesting story, and he describes the martian flora and fauna very well, but there are some things that are glossed over (like what happened in the cave) and the only character that is explored with any depth is Jon Carter."
2,"Thoroughly interesting. The organization of this book must of been very creative for the time. A group consisting of everyone from a cook to a knight set out on a religios pilgrimage to Canterbury. A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy."
1,"I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!"
2,"This is just an adorable little pillow. It will be great as an added decoration in my baby room. Remember this is a BABY pillow, so it is smaller and not made for an adult. The person who previously gave this pillow a rating thought it was too flat and small, but I found it was perfect for a baby room:) Plus! It's a perfect match to the Nautica 4 piece crib set."
1,The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
2,"Orwell's 1984 is certainly one of the greatest novels ever written. It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement."
1,This was a good product overall. it was just bad quality. it seemed like it was burned off of an original. Every disk says disk 1 the title scene is blurry and parts of the episodes are pretty choppy.
1,"It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
1,"I am sorry to say, but this book was without a doubt, one of the wrost books I have ever read in my life. The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring. When I first read the book, I had heard great things about it, but when I read the book, I was very disspointed. Take my advise, don't read the book."
2,This book is a great book for those who care about the earth. There are so many great quotes and stories that are still relevant to our societal values. We use this book at camp to open campers' eyes to the world around them. The contents are a great inspiration and conversation starters.
2,"ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card)."
2,Girlfriend loved them. Price was better then local area stores. She has other colors of the same shoe so they last a lifetime.
1,"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."
2,A neat twist looking at it from the older sister's point of view. She truly believes she loves her sister. Her love like many of our loves is conditional and fear based. It isn't until she is compelled to write her story that the process of self-awareness takes hold and she goes through the myth herself. As she does this her true love for Psyche and all the others including herself grow as well.
1,In general I like Pampers items and quality. But the Baby Dry version I seem to have a lot of leaks.
1,"Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt, but its not wort 10 bucks at all, cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru. very thin cloth."
2,eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
1,"Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?"
2,This is a very good book with useful tips. I tried baking my pie on the floor of the oven like she suggests. The first time it turned out amazing. Every time since it has burned. Anyone have ideas why this happened? I have tried reducing the temperature and the crust comes out nice and golden but seems a little tougher to me.
2,Th' Squidbillies kin be watched on over an' on over agin. Th' episodes is so fast thet yo' miss most of it th' fust few times through. Eff'n yo' like hilarity made by 'mericans in 'merica fo' 'mericans then this hyar is th' video fo' yo'! Fry mah hide!!
1,"When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth."
1,"I started reading the book and will have to stop and learn mathematical notation and some terminology first . I'm hopeful the infomation is correct , but it is over my curious head at the moment ."
1,"This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
2,A very interesting read. The historical content was excellent as it came to life. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Makes you reflect on what values are really important to you and how easily you can be sidetracked and never get back to the place you should be in some instances. On the other hand with some perseverance you can get back on track and be in good standing.
2,"This story will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn't let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed. The lesson to be learned from this book, is that the majority of us at one time or another have walked to the fringe and escaped unchanged and luckier then we can imagine . A horrific tale that hopefully will save others a simliar FATE, It's difficult to comprehend that this is just one family's tragedy out of the thousands of cries of anguish that go on in silence. Trust me (or not), don't miss this book !"
2,This book does not have the most up-to-date photography but they are good enough and the general sentiment and prose are very nice. It gracefully combines science with the wonder of it all which makes a lovely combination. I had it 26 years ago when I was pregant and still recommend it.
1,"THE WORST CD I'VE EVER BOUGHT.I BOUGHT THIS CD BASED ON ALL OF THESE RAVING REVIEWS THAT YOU'LL READ BELOW.I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THE MP3 SAMPLES, BUT PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/AMAZON/AOL OR ALL OF THE ABOVE KEPT ME FROM FROM SAMPLING THIS PURCHASE.IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.SOUNDS LIKE MY SONS GARAGE BAND TRYING TO PLAY BUFFETT SONGS."
2,"This was everything that I wanted in a Batman movie. Great acting, action, characters and plot. Best Batman movie yet in my opinion.I saw this movie first in Galway and thought it was really good, but when I saw it a second time in Paris I found it much better than the first time. Emotional score, dramatic acting and dark to the core. Brilliant."
2,"As many reviewers have noted, it is not an easy ready but well worth the time and certainly the effort.There is love, intrigue, war, life, death, laughter and tears. All told in the classic Latin American Literature style. What more can a reader ask for?Pick it up, read it and dream about the characters for days."
1,"First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6."
1,"I ordered these new born pamer diapers in advance so I would be prepared for when my baby came. To my surprise these diapers were a bit larger then the new born pamper ones the hospital sent me home with and they didn't have the stripe indicator that turns blue for when they have a wet diaper which is important when dealing with a new born. I havent used the diapers yet i ordered from Amazon because they r a bit too big for my new born, even though they say new born on the box and they don't have the stripe indicator..... I wouldn't recommend getting these new born diapers."
2,"I am on my 8th Scarpetta story. I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's."
2,I like the book Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. My favorite part in the book was when Mrs.Philips gave William a gift. Do you know what the gift was? Can you figure out what it is? I recommend this book because Castle In the Attic is a very exciting novel to read.

1,"Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it."
1,"The Nickelodeon money machine has struck again. By taking Spongebob off TV and making him a movie, Nickelodeon has done a disservice to those of us who have enjoyed Spongebob over the years. This movie is ridiculous. A story that would normally be given 11 minutes has been stretched into well over an hour of boredom. None of the characters were further fleshed out and the jokes were few and far between.Plankton has stolen Neptune's crown and pinned it on Mr. Krabbs. It's Spongebob and Patrick to the rescue. You would think some of the peripheral characters, like Sandy and Squidward would get more screen time, but no. Just dull. The worst episode is better than this movie. Nick was just trying to get the Spongebob name on a marquee so they could cash in."
2,"I loved this book! I suggest it for anyone who knows how Brooklyn was at that time.Because both my parents and also two of my grandparents were New York city kids. I am only a 13 year old girl but I have an adult reading level. I think this book had an incredible plot and some of the most wonderfull charecters ever written about. Learning of Francie's life, her thoughts and her pain was incredibly interesting."
2,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD other than a great voice. What I got was that and a great mixture of ballads, mid-tempo songs and songs filled with angst and love. There is something for everyone on this album. Don't listen to reviews that say it is too vanilla or lacks even a hint of sexual innuendo. Listen to the song Touch and hear the sexy longing in the voice and the words. The only thing better than listening to this album would be to see it performed live."
1,"My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
2,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
1,"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
2,I saw them on Pledge of a Legence Tour with Lincin Park Slipknot and Static X they were great it was head banging thrshing and also very loud I brought this album after the show and liked it but was dissapointed.
1,"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead."
2,"All I can say is Caine is the bomb and he makes alot of his ""I need beans"" expressions in this film!"
2,"Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content."
1,"Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where."
2,This has a great discription on what each plant needs and how big it will grow. I have started several of my seeds already.
1,"Don't bother. It is next to impossible to get this product to work. Tried everything (USB, download driver, etc.) and nothing worked - with XP Pro. ended up in the trash."
1,"This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far. It also depicts Mexicans as cult members and grotesque.It places people in the Caribbean speaking with a Castillian accent. A real piece of trash and mentally disturbing."
1,SELLER DOESN'T RESPOND BACK EITHER. WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! DON'T BUY HERE!!!! CHEAP CHINAM JUNK!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!!DON'T BUY HERE. CHEAP BOLT ON SET UP......TWISTED OFF AND BROKE THE FIRST TIME. LUCKY IT DIDN'T SMASH A FOOT OR FINGERS. LAWSUIT TIME IF IT DID.WARNING!!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!! DON'T BUY HERE. CHEAP CHINA JUNK!!!!!
2,"I ordered this book as it was my book club selection, very sure I would not find it terribly interesting. What a surprise it turned out to be! This is a very readable, colorful story of an immigrant family in early 1900's Brooklyn. With every page, Betty Smith carried me away to these neighborhoods and ethnic communities. I loved the trip."
2,"I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound."
1,"DVD was purchased as a gift for christmas,. once the recipent opened it to play it he realized the DVD wouldnt work. I was very un happy with the fact that it did not work"
1,"I realize that this ""should"" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six. Sorry, but that is simply unacceptable. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for letting it go on this long. I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth."
1,This is completely wrong. What type of person would give their 3yr old daughter a doll that is wearing thong underwear. I was blown away when I figured this out.Never would I recommend this doll!
1,"There are many good Muslims. Unfortunately, the author, Mr. Mamdani is not one of them. He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich"
1,"the shipping was fast, as usual by Amazon. The product is terrible, you can barely see the logo, its not a real Colts blue, more of a very dark navy almost purple color. They will be going back. I should have known the price was too good to be true for a product of any real value."
2,I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!
2,"So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach ""pooch"". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"
2,"I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James."
2,"If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, regardless of your gender, you will enjoy this film. There's something in it for everyone, it's not just a ""chick flick"". Drew and Adam are superb and the story is unique and captivating - especially for a comedy. And it's a great date film. Show your date you actually have a sense of humor and see this movie together!"
1,I am not satisfied with this product. When i loaded it on my cpu I loaded the label part first. When I attempted to load the print shop portion the program stopped working and locked my computer up. I finally had to unplug the cpu and re-power it up to get it running again. I removed the Printshop version and tried to remove the Label portion but could not. When I tried to do some labels on the program I found it to be more complicated that it should have been. I spoke to a friend and she said she had the same problem with Printshop and it took her son-in-law five days to fix the problem.
1,"Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. Sadly it is not. It is taken from the same horrible print. Decent movie, but baaaaad quality. Let the buyer beware! This is the item I bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YVX9/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,"This is just a knock off of crocodile dentist. It comes from China, and was already broken. The package was so beat up, I couldn't even give it as a gift. Also, it doesn't work. It just snaps every 2nd tooth, and sometimes the teeth don't pop up. This is a very small version as well, the description doesn't tell you it's travel size."
2,"well, if you like MTV and you cannot go a week without looking at bright clothing, and your biggest fear is having to spend time in the country, you will not want to listen to this album. If you have any idea what it means to listen to music with a purpose, even if that purpose is not readily explainable, you should like this stuff. I like Will oldham so that may have alot to do with my appreciation of this album and anything that sounds like this. Maybe?"
2,"Purchased this too see if it was any better than regular glue or spending any money at a cobbler to get my shoes fixed. Works pretty good, so far it is still sticking! Only thing is it does have a strong smell so use it in a ventilated area or outside and its pretty much the same as liquid cement (or it is liquid cement). So if you have that laying around or can find that cheaper - I would use that as well!"
2,Got this at a great deal and loved the movie. It's nice that I can watch it on my iTouch anytime and not on Flixster under restrictions.
2,"Bought this for my husband for christmas. He has a MATTHEWS switchback compound bow. It fits nicely in this case without having to remove the quiver from bow. Has velcro ties to hold bow on bottom, sits on top of padding. Top has section to hold your arrows. Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside. Very good case for the cheap price."
1,"This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."
1,"I think that this is innappropriate for kids, because they should not grow up thinking that vegetables can talk. This should be taken into consideration before purchasing this video. My daughter now talks to any vegetable that comes home with the groceries."
1,"I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
1,I was trying to find a dress for the military formal for weeks. I had read the reviews for this particular dress and I was afraid it wouldnt fit. After searchinghigh and low for 1 nice dress to wear I just decided to order it and if it neededto be altered I'd do it. It only took 4 days for the dress to be sent to me with regular standard shipping. I tried the dress on and it fit amazingly well. I dontneed to alter a thing. I paid 57.00 total and in a store for something like this I was looking at rediculous prices. I'm going to have to say that I'm very verypleased with this dress and for any other upcoming event I may just buy it again but in a new color. :-)
2,"My love for Bjork's voice began when I was in fifth grade and heard ""It's Oh So Quiet"" for the first time at a dance rehearsal. I rediscovered her two years later when I began my collection of Bjork CD's which is now at 15. ""Post"", my favorite, is a breath of fresh air from the uncreative, trendy, shallow, too feel-good, or too angsty sounds you hear on the radio nowadays. Each song has a different tone, emotion, and musical arrangement from the techno beat of ""Hyperballad"" to the stark sounds and keyboards of ""Possibly Maybe"" to the drum beat and screams in ""I Miss You."" Bjork's tireless voice is beautiful and full of energy- it growls, screams, slides, whispers. Her music cannot not be categorized- each song is a different style and attitude. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a change from the ordinary. I guarantee you will become addicted- I am."
2,"Had the cassette when I was 16, missed having it and had the chance to purchase it again. Fast shipping, great condition, just love it!"
1,"This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
2,The bluray arrived at my house within 3 business days of purchase even with the using the cheapest style of shipping. The discs and box were in good condition as described. The ninth season has some hard to follow spots that do not get explained right off. Has a couple of slow spots as well. Otherwise as a whole the series and this season were well written with a good story line.
1,"I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album."
2,"E' dai tempi del tour di ""empire"" che non vedevo i queensryche cos in gran forma, questo dvd per me  il migliore di tutta la loro carriera, e la consacrazione di una band, dopo questo dvd si pu tranquillamente dire che i queenssryche sono entrati nella storia del grande rock come i Deep purple, led zeppelin e thin lizzy negli anni settanta.I queensryche sempre si sono distinti dagli altri gruppi del loro genere, Geoff Tate  uno dei pi importanti vocalists di tutti i tempi.Questo dvd  musica e teatro, la collaborazione pi stretta con Pamela Moore rende questo dvd imperdibile.Una sola nota negativa, purtroppo nella composizione della seconda parte si sente l'assenza di Chris De Garmo,Mike Stone  un grande chitarrista, ma Chris De Garmo per me era fondamentale per la band, hanno perso la parte pi melodoca, che era a mio parere molto importante in questo gruppo!"
1,"Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier."
1,"I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about ""Papua New Guinea"". Believe the hype about ""Papua New Guinea!"" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable (""Calcium"" and ""Expander""), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear ""Papua New Guinea"", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price."
2,"This book is a good start for someone who is interested in the paranormal and would like to try some of the techniques that investigators use to capture evidence of unexplained activity. There is helpful information on forming an investigative group and lists equipment that someone might wish to purchase. Richard Southall does a good job of describing how to use each piece of equipment to gather evidence. He does also express his theories on the paranormal, and it is interesting to listen to his point of view. I think this is a good start, but seasoned investigators are not likely to learn anything new."
2,"I recieved this in less than 2 days. Bought this for the fiance for his birthday, he's not use to wearing rings but i wanted to point out that this ring is pretty wide and thick, he'll just have to get use to it. Its a great product and an even great price!"
2,"This NYC group has authentic early reggae/rocksteady sound. The music features great organ and tight rhythm section. The lyrics are just right for the mood of each song. Includes a brilliant rocksteady version of Johnny Cash's ""Long Black Veil"" -- best remake of this classic song I've heard. If you didn't know, you'ld swear it was the late 60s and you were catching Jamaican radio broadcasts."
2,I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. I don't have time to take a class so I bought this video. I am soooo happy I did! I have learned sooo much and feel very confident now about what to expect at the labor. Sherri Bayles is funny and explains things very very well. I highly recommend this video.
1,"This book is dull, and I do not know why people like to read it and then to make it into a MOVIE and a PLAY. Boring writing, mild characters, slow almost motionless plot."
2,"Wow this was the best Batman movie yet. Christian Bale has an awesome voice better than Michle Keeton had. Let me tell the Scarecrow scared the heck out of me. If liked the first Batmans you'll like this one more. If you like bats, adventure, big tanks, and awesome sequences this is the movie for you."
2,"The Vicar of Wakefield is a wonderful book. A little slow going sometimes, but still a good read. Not only does it tell a story of a family but it also relates very well to real life moral and ethic values. It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."
2,"The book gives a thorough discussion on the PRACTICAL implementation of the Transactional Ananlysis ""I am OK, You are OK"" theory.It is therefore a must read if you are into Transaction Analysis or you just want to imporve your leadership skill.Please remember to come back to give this review a vote after you have purchased the book and have read it form cover to cover.P."
2,It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
2,"When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much"
2,"I've been flipping through the songs on Clay's CD that I just got. Wow~ I still can't get over his amazing voice. If you are thinking about getting this CD, DO IT~~! The lyrics are awesome and the whole CD is fantastic!"
1,"I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"
1,"While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'."
2,This CD is great. Matthew is an extremely talented singer/song writer. There is such a variety of songs on this CD that it keeps you listening without skipping around. I love all of the songs especially History and Grace. My young children love it too. I cannot wait for his next CD or even when he comes to my area in concert.
2,"I read this novel as a trilogy of Prelude to Foundation, Foundation and Second Foundation. The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader."
1,"As a fan of jazz from the 50's and 60's, I keep trying to like this piece. Many of Coltrane's phrases repeat the same notes over and over. This can be clever once in a while, but over and over, it's just annoying. The first number is torture if you like melodic music. There's no connection between the phasing and the rhythm. Again, is this supposed to be clever? If you subscribe to the idea that ""weird is genious"", then you may like this CD.There are many sax players from this period who have better tone and phrasing. Coltrane's tone is like listening to someone sing while holding their nose."
2,"Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous."
2,"A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a ""Mediterranean"" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichs and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la ""This Old House.""OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."
1,BAD. NOT A GOOD BAD . JUST PLAIN BAD.PEOPLE RUN BACKWARDS AND WEAPONS FLOAT IN THE AIR.THERE IS NO THINKING TO DO ON A MISSION AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PULL A TRIGGER.MISSIONS ARE TOO SHORT. A LOT OF EFFORT PROBABLY WENT INTO THE GAME BUT IT'S STILL JUST PLAIN AND UGLY BAD.
2,"A large percentage of the book is from the Lisa's point of view, a young girl on the brink of puberty, but this is not a young adult book. It has none of the typical angst you often see in today's teen characters. There is no romance. A Coming of Age is more like a SciFi Crime Drama, a mystery set on another planet with twists and turns so complex I was always on the edge of my seat.One thing I found refreshing was the lack of over-explanation. Zahn left it up to his readers to interpret subtle clues about the plot and alien terminology from the context. I felt like a grown-up, reading a book that gave me a chance to flex my brain.I don't say this often, but this book would make an exceptional film!"
2,"Makes TiVo networking a snap! I tried several other adapters first, only to find that none were compatible. (That cost you a star, TiVo! Yes, I consulted the hardware list...) This item is well-made and attractive as gadgets go. For ease of setup, I highly recommend this adapter."
2,"This CD is the best! I purchased it today at a local store, and I have listened to it 4 times already. All the songs on this CD are awesome. Clay has the best voice that I have heard in a long time. I LOVE YOU CLAY!!!!!!"
1,Sorry. This CD was a great disappointment. The songs are terrible. These songs are not meant for Clay's voice. He needs to sing better songs than whats on this Cd. Where's the power of Clay's voice. He needs to pick his songs carefully in the future. Very disappointed with this one.
2,"I am using this pillow now and about to enter my second trimester. I find the pillow to be comfortable and useful in training myself to sleep on my side. I actually find the pillow most comfortable upside down (with the connected piece at my feet). This allows me to use the side bolsters, elevate my feet, AND use my own pillow."
2,"I read a lot of books... and rarely have I had the experience that I had with this one. Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."
2,"If I hadn't already seen them live a couple of years ago, I would swear this was studio magic. But it's not, just one of the greatest bands ever, and the best live band I have ever heard! Buy this, you will not be disappointed. I bought it for the Blu Ray, and it is stunning. Video and Audio is breath taking. Enjoy!"
2,"I am really happy with the result of this product. Just follow the instruction, take it regularly. You'll be able to get the result within one week. Now I feel better refreshed, better smashed. Thanks to the company for making it available in the amazon."
1,"I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
2,"This book is great history lesson, written with love and passion.Young people could learn many good things about relationship between woman and man."
2,As techers we should learn more by reading now a days and this is a good book that helps you and gives you ideas about how to elaborate your rubrics.
2,"This is a book written by Jennifer Crusie before her blockbuster best-sellers. It's shorter than her recent books (written to that short, digestable romance format), so the characters aren't as well developed as you'll find in ""Tell Me Lies"", ""Crazy for You"", ""Welcome to Tempation"", ""Fast Women"". But Crusie is such a solid writer (and was back then, too) she rises above the limiting format and delivers a solid, fast-paced, enjoyable tale. She has a gift for humor and believable, but witty, dialog. You do come to care for the characters. I'd recommend this book!"
2,"I bought this toaster 3 months ago and I have no regrets at all, it is very fast to heat and also reasonably priced.I mainly use it for re-heating pizza, sometimes pieces of baguettes (hey, bread again feels like just-made!) and to make sandwiches. Although a experienced cooker may get a lot more from it."
1,"Not sure what the other person was smoking when reviewing this book, but must be a beginner to Dire Straits. This was very poorly done. In many places, the tabs are incorrect. It looks like the transcriber just did what they thought or liked rather than validate it. I would not have bought this book if I had known how wrong it was. I suppose on a plus note it provides an alternate method. Also, the print it too small.Don't buy the book. There are free tabs on the internet that are closer to the way it was played."
2,"If you love to listen to ""Amahl and the Night Visitors"" every Christmas, then you will enjoy this wonderful made for TV production on DVD. I recommend this!"
2,"A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer."
1,"As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
1,"Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
1,you may not take me seriously because i am a teenager but i am a big fan of the harry potter books. larry potter pails in comparison to harry potter and basically any other book it also uses similar termonoilgy and is a copycat that is why i even brought up harry potterso dont waste your time reading this book life isnt long enough
1,"I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
1,"I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually."
2,"My girlfriend purchased this watch for me for christmas, I'm 23, and love it!!! Now instead of answering my friends for what time it is, I just push a button. lol, Seriously awesome watch!!!!!"
1,"The DVD came rattling in the box. When I tried to get the DVD to play my DVD player it said, "" wrong region."" I'm not sure what this meant???. All my other DVDs work just fine."
2,Loved this series when I was very young with pleasant memories. Wanted to get them . Have gotten every one as they have been released. Have not been disappointed. Will continue till collection complete. Nostalgia is a warm fuzzy feeling watching this series from the past. Wow how styles and life has changed then.Perry has always been a favorite for me.
1,"I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book."
1,"I was thrilled to read all the online reviews of this book, as it sounded like just the thing I was looking for. I perused a copy at a bookstore, and absolutely hated it! The style is not cottage at all, but country: flowered chintz everywhere, clutter, cutesy. If you're looking for the simplicity of cottage style, this is not the book for you."
1,"Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2"" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal"
2,My 5 year old twin boys have just begun to enjoy this series of books after reading two of the Billy and Blaze books saved from my own childhood. I decided to complete the collection for them and have bought all the other books. These classic boy-and-faithful-horse-adventure stories have a timeless appeal that have been a joy to revisit for me and to discover for the first time for them.
1,"I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might be fun. I wanted to show it to my third grade class, but I don't think it would hold their interest. All in all I felt I was watching someone's home video of their family doing yoga."
1,"good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online"
1,"While most people described in this book are certainly interesting, many are regular people (like me) with fine achievements but with no particular attractiveness to warrant inclusion in a ""greatest"" list. I keep waiting to see what many of these ""greatest"" people did,,,and wonder why my parents, of the same generation and with a better story (at least in my opinion), weren't included! Short, basic bios. Its a fair night stand book...for those who fall asleep easily."
1,"I am a bit peeved because I think I got used ones, as they had scratches on them out of the box. That said, these wheels work OKAY, not too great. Had trouble placing washer / drier legs on them as they slide off unless they are placed right in the middle of the squares. The other issue is the wheels don't swivel, so you can basically just go straight with them, which almost never happens when you are moving appliances. If you have to turn at an angle with the appliance on these wheels, good luck. I would pay a bit more to buy a dolly with swiveling wheels next time."
1,"I've been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've left a comment because I hope that you won't waste your money like I did. I have 2 sons. My baby uses the Swaddlers and my toddler uses Cruisers. When Cruisers was unavailable online, I thought, the Baby Dry can't be that much different, they both are made by Pampers, right? WRONG!! I have been washing wet bed sheets and pjs every single morning for 2 weeks since my toddler used the Baby Dry. It can not hold anything. I had my son pee in a clean Baby Dry standing straight, waited for a minute, then took the diaper off. The pee was dripping out from the diaper. It was the worst diaper we have ever tried. I heard that Pampers changed the Cruisers to be thinner as well. I am giving Huggies a try now. Though it was not as soft as Pampers, I have not need to wash the wet bed sheet or pjs for the past week. Now I have a big box of Baby Dry diapers sitting in my garage that I can't decided if I should donate..."
1,"We received this toy as a gift for my 16 month child and found out early on that the magnet is NOT attracted to any metal of any type. So being the tinker that I am, I took the magnet section apart to find that THERE IS NO MAGNET IN THERE! There was just 3 washers (like the metals discs with holes in the middle of them) and they weren't magnetized at all. I tried sticking one of my own magnets in there but I do not have a strong enough magnet. It just didn't work. Unfortunately since I have taken it apart already, I cannot send it back, but maybe I can convince some of you to NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
1,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film."
2,"great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go."
2,"This Bible is the new updated NASB translation. The translation is accurate, but this particular Bible has only the basics. The print is fairly cramped, and as far as extra perks go, there are a few B&W maps and a small concordance. A good economy Bible to own, but no special frills."
2,"Beautifully illustrated and easy to follow instructions. The patterns, sewing instructions and examples are written in a way that anyone, beginner or novice will complete equally beautiful works."
1,"The first three books held my interest the whole way through. Intelligent writing and an exciting story. Foundations Edge was okay. Foundation and Earth, however, was preposterous. I'm afraid to say a LONG, boring story with a rediculous ending. He didn't really want to write these two books and it shows."
1,"I'm a big fan of off the wall movies. When I read the reviews I thought this would be a great movie. I really didn't pay attention to the negative ones. The description was interesting and the cover art made it look like this girl was over the top, and would be fun to watch her. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was 30 minutes into the movie before I even laughed, and that was the only laugh of the movie. I was hoping it would just end, it was so STUPID! I waisted my money big time! I've never reviewed any of my past purchases, but after watching this I had to warn people. My only recommendation is try to watch it first before you buy it. I guarantee you won't"
1,"I understand lowbut,I would like listen BRANT BJORK & OPERATORSIN THIS SITE. IN OTHER TIME, PERHAPS.THANKS"
2,"THIS GROUP DIDN'T RECEIVE THE ATTENTION THEY DESERVED. I OWN THIS CD, AND I PLAY IT CONSTANTLY. I OWN THE SINGLE OF 'HAVE I NEVER', AND I OWN THE FULL LENGTH CD. 'A FEW GOOD MEN' IS ONE OF BABYFACE'S BEST PROTGS. I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE ANOTHER CD."
1,"I like Sarah. I like her way of speaking, I enjoy how expressive she is, and how charming she is. I enjoyed looking at her costumes in this dvd and will be in my sewing room trying to recreate the sparkly belts she was showing us. The choreographies are good for beggining belly dancers. I was hoping for a break down of the Turkish dance style here, but there were only two choreographies. No real explanation of Turkish or the raw elements that can be used outside of those choreographies. But I can't get over what a good speaker Sarah is and how fun she is to watch and listen to."
2,The audio CD of a Tree Grows in Brooklyn was wonderful. I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!
2,"1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the ""future"" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."
2,"One thing that I found frustrating is that the second DVD in the series was more of a workout dvd, while this was more breaking down the moves.While I do go to a hooping class, I also want to speed up my learning curve with the hoops and I found this dvd to be a great help. Everything is broken down and explained in a clear and concise manner."
1,"This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
1,"Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution."
1,This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
1,"I don't know how it happened, but I opened up my DVD case to find a pretty DVD labeled ""Lord of the Wu Tang"" in color, started up the DVD and it played ""Salsa Kings 2"" instead of Jet Li's Lord of the Wu Tang. I've seen Lord of the Wu Tang by the way and it is a top notch cheesey sci fi Sunday morning karate flick with pull wires galore. The story line is classic as well and well worth any amount of sub title reading and convinced me the best chinese karate flicks are sub-titled. I've gotta contact Amazon about the switch that happened, hopefully it works out."
1,"I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both books (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it. The book looked nothing like the picture and it was very cleared written that I was supposed to get both. I got jipped."
2,"Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records."
1,"I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."
1,"I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he's never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I'd say ok for someone who doesn't really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I'd save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven't got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!"
1,I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it.
1,"""Under The Tuscan Sun"": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."
1,"It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times."
2,"This entire book is set in lands we will never see, with contraptions we will never use, yet I can visualize them. I can believe in them. It is almost as if Wagner has tapped into another dimension and is just telling it as he sees it.This is a must read."
2,"This book truly lives up to what Vincent Bugliosi says on the first page of his book ""Helter Skelter-The True Story Of The Manson Murders""-- ""This story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you."" This is not only the best true crime book ever written, but it is the ONLY true crime story ever written. Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book."
2,"I must admit that I have a fetish for Bjork and PJ Harvey, so I don't claim to be objective. But honestly, this is really a relevant CD for anyone interested in decent mainstream pop music. Bjork can turn her limits (naive vocal technique, an icelandic accent you could cut with a knife) into peculiar qualities. She is unique in her ability to couple unusual harmonic passages with quirk turns of phrase and superb arrangements. This album defies classification -- there's big-band jazz, trip-hop, electronic dance, ""sugarcubes"", trance, soundtrack-like strings, even traces of Abba's notorius pop. This is an album that has not created a genre like ""Dummy"" by Portishead, but is vastly superior to it and many other for its musicality, originality, literary quality and sense of humor. ""Homogenic"" is equally good, but much more tense and influenced by the Bristol scene."
1,"The most uncomfortable, overpriced piece of foam on the market. Also beware that there is a 10 day return policy on this piece of junk."
1,"i found this cd to be quite generic. the music, to me, was bland and lifeless. equal parts rap & singing, the vocals were predominant in the mix. the music was ok, heavy and slighlty melodic but i just never got into it. music should scream through your stero and say LISTEN TO THIS but this cd failed to grab my attention."
2,Want to learn where to get potent seeds? Fancy breeding your own line of marijuana in your greenhouse or bedroom? Are you looking for the ins and outs of grow room design? This book has left no stone unturned. I love the way this book is designed ( like a growing plant ). There is good and new information everywhere in the book. You will grow some fat budz with it. There are illustrations to help you through some of the harder set ups. This grow book comes with online product support. Can you believe it?? ??There is where you should be going. Just get the darn book already ....
2,"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and although I'm only 15, I have read a number of them. The plot, characters, and dialouge are well thought out and well developed. The book, Castles, comes before this in the series and it is also very enjoyable. If you haven't read this book, do so."
1,"These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn't able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Not a good idea."
1,"I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. I bought everything that was recommended to use, the steel wool pads and the chemical gloves. This product ate through all the gloves we used, it disolved one of my friends acrylic fingernails, it felt like it was ice-burning our skin, made us all light-headed in a ventilated room and it barely did any improvements to my cabinets. I am concerned about us all absorbing this into our skin and any effect that may cause. I am returning all of the cans and I am VERY disappointed in this product."
2,this is the direction R.Kelly is going with on his Musical Virus Project.this cut has a cool Jamaican Feel. R.Kelly is channeling elements of Bob Marley&Harry Belefonte on his vocal runs. real smooth joint. this track is so Cool&has a soulful vibe all the way through.I ai't feeling the Re-Mix though. but I like the direction He his taken with going in different directions.this is a Classic Kells Jam.
2,"Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."
2,"An exellent study of the German Airforce from the fall of Sevastopol in the Crimea to its failure at Stalingrad. Very well written, with a clear analysis of the events. Well worth the money and it belongs in every major collection on World War II's Eastern Front."
2,Very nice book! I am very happy with all the information on this book. It explains a lot of english grammar!
2,"This CD is great! It's lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as ""Dear Friend"" and ""Everything I Have"" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track ""Stay True"""
2,"I bought this over five months ago to replace a leaky ball (a different brand). This one is still firm from the initial inflation. It's round, it's the specified size, and it doesn't leak. What more can you ask of a ball?"
2,"Island is an excellent novel that, even after 50 years, remains relevant because the story line resonates in terms of how we humans consistently, perhaps not consciously, but most assuredly, and maybe even inevitably, undermine the foundations of utopia through our daily actions, decisions and attitudes."
1,"Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!"
1,"The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
2,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, although self-serving, made some excellent points. He was an excellent networker, and was way ahead of some current gurus on how to get ahead in the business world. However, he proved with his son that he could hold a grudge. He also neglected his wife. He had a fine sense of timing in political matters and knew the value of patience and persistence in his time in France and England."
1,"The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity? How is my understanding of, or sympathy toward, humanity improved by attempting to read and decode the word ""Bababadalgharaghtakamminnarronkonnbronntonneronntuon- thunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoordenenthurnuk""? There are many far greater works that not only tell the same story, but are readable and even enjoyable. My apologies to those who like Finnegan's Wake, but humanity is not best served by having its story told in gibberish."
1,"These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
2,"This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."
1,I was suprise to recieve both dvds being DISC 1 - Feature Film & no Special Features.Your FEEDBACK features did not have any column with product defect !
1,"This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students."
2,"One thing I can state about diapers as a mother of 2 and a grandmother of 1 is that you can NEVER go by the poundage shown for the diaper fit. My experience has been that the children go into the size well BEFORE they are in the poundage recommended. I have also found that it really depends on the build of the child as to which brand works best for them. We have tried the major brands on our granddaughter and found that PAMPERS works best for her and we have no leakage problems.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers, Size 6, 128-Count"
2,This is great little book. I love that it has easy to understand signs to teach my daughter. Adds a playful dimension to this classic song.
1,"Robocop: Great, great sci-fi action film, famous mostly for it's extreme graphicness. Rated R.Robocop 2: Manages to be just as, if not more, graphic than Robocop. You can tell they try to be controversial too. (Kid as a drug lord, man holds a gun to a baby's head) Rated R.Robocop 3: New actor, Robocop learns to fly...almost no blood the entire film. Rated PG13.What the $#!@ happened?!"
1,"I received this book in late December, months after I ordered it and long after I needed it. I contacted the seller and received no reply."
2,"I really enjoyed this new author! The hero and heroine seemed pretty evenly matched when it came to wits, and the sex was hot! Add in their jobs, a strange case with a dog, and medical mishaps, and I thought it was a funny riot! I was glad there was a HEA!"
2,"It's larger than I expected, it's pretty big. The quality seems ok, the interior is made of some kind of fabric/textile material, it's not wood or plastic. The suitcase looks good and I'm satisfied so far."
2,I haven't as of yet come across another album with such a wonderfully mellow techno-jazz beat. One of the best music purchases I've ever blindly bought. Especially good for those listeners who enjoy a hauntingly beautiful women's voice laced throughout their beats. Cannot reccomend this album strongly enough!!
2,"it is a good diaper, because it is reasonable price, good quality, comfortable for baby, over all i can say good diaper."
2,"I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
2,The most unusual story of a young man facing life with a handicap. I felt like a cheerleader and prayed that he could overcome. I could hardly wait to reach the end of the book. Don't peek!
1,"...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, ""Fish"", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling (""didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?"") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures."
2,"19th Century Social Thought is given in terms of heroes.Thinkers like Carlyle are really rare.Book is composed of his lectures about Paganism, Islam, Shakspeare, Puritanism etc. in 1840."
2,This is a keystone book that should be in every entomologist's library next to Chapman's The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano's The Science of Entomology.
2,I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept.
1,"i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg."
2,"For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984."
1,"This album is a bloated, boring mess. The songs are overlong and overloud--they remind me more of Meatloaf than anything else. I can't believe this is the same band that created the brilliant ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory""....Avoid this ridiculous album at all costs."
2,"I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called ""Daughters of Darkness"" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
2,This mold is great for what I need. Chocolate pops right out of the plastic. would buy again if needed
2,"Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. ""Man of La Mancha"" has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short, heart-warming play that is, if possible, even greater than the source material.In ""Man of La Mancha"", the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is ""insanity""? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"
2,Literary classic that I am glad that I read. I just wish I read it years ago. I will have to go back to my childhood home to see if I can find the book I had when I was a child.
2,"""A Campfire for Cowboy Billy"" is not only a charming tale, it's a resonant one. Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."
2,"one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense."
2,"This, the first book in the series of ""Earth's Children"" is a gripping, fascinating introduction to the first of our thinking ancestors. Almost as if we were there."
2,I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre.
2,"i lovd ths buk. it waz the best book evr. when i red it i was so happy. it has a lot of action, and its abot a boy in his tens. he goes to new mexiko. this buk was very gud for cids mi age. pleese red ths buk. i red thic buk with mi clasz. thy all licked it. ..."
2,"James Alan Gardner is one of my new favorite authors. In Expendable, he has created a new and exciting universe peopled by characters who breathe and live between the pages. Some aspects of this book were predictable. However, it is still a page turner.I found it interesting that he wrote this book from the viewpoint of a female. It is written in first person perspective.The book is also a study of human nature and behavior. It has some funny bits, some poignant bits and a lot of great imagery. This is an excellent book. Honestly, it is one of the best ""first"" books I have read.Right after this book, I read ""Commitment Hour"" also by this author. Gardner's second book, it is also well worth checking out, if you can get past the premise. I'll also write a review about that book."
2,"I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life."
1,"Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage... I started off with Binchy, relieved that these were not ""romance novels,"" but three or four books into her plethora, I find them to be glorified Barbara Cartlands. The difference is, in the more recent ones, they all sell food."
2,This movie is so terrific. It has a well planned plot and it will surprise you in the end. What scared me is that a lot of what they said I could actually make sense out of and understand. I love it. I could watch it over and over.
1,"I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you."
1,"When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
1,"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
1,"I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."
2,"Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston."
2,"One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Challenging, epic, and stunningly beautiful writing. As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in."
1,The author points out that this series of crimes is of little importance and has largely been forgotten. It will remain so.
1,"This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"
2,".... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above."
1,Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.
1,"I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
1,"We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
1,"Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary. Not worth it if you're not actually studying the subject or have advanced interest in psycho-analysis."
1,"I bought this book planning on checking the Feng Shui for my house for the year 2002 and find out after reading several chapters that Lillian Too assumes your house was built since 1984 or has had major renovation during this period. If this is not the case then the rest of the book (i.e. the most important part) is totally useless. Buy another book, any book except this one."
1,Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. I read to be drawn into a story and it did not happen.
1,Written in 1970's it's really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Glad I bought it used-but shipping was more than the price!
2,"I haven't seen this film in over 20 years, but had fond memories of it. Watching it was like seeing an old friend. The film is a bit dated, and does feel like the filmed stage play it is, but is enjoyable none the less. Julie Waters gives a really memorable performance as Rita. I'm happy I added this nice little film to my nice little film library."
1,"This is strictly a tourist rag. Don't waste your time. If your looking for a basic introduction to Voodoo, try Laennec Hurbon's Voodoo: Search for the Spirit; Voodoo & Hoodoo by Jim Haskins; Sallie Anne Glassman's Vodou Visions; Leah Gordon's Book of Vodou or even the Complete Idiots Guide to Voodoo."
2,This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
1,"I've read several other Deborah Smith books. In my opinion Blue Willow was the best. Sweet Hush was by far the corniest book, I've read in a long time. The phrase ""Sweet Hush"" must have been at used at least 100 times in the book. The main character ""Hush"" was predictable and one dimentional. If you enjoy Deborah Smith books, I would skip this one."
1,"Summer of My German Soldier is an average book. It is kind of romantic so I didn't like it that much. But that's just me. When my reading teacher first introduced this book, I thought it would be the best war book I had ever read. (This is because I am a huge war buff.) Before I even started reading, I was imagining an action-filled, danger at ever turn, war book. I was soooooo wrong! After reading the first few pages, I immediately became bored. I just hope that the sequel, Morning is a Long Time Comming, is better."
1,I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
2,"From the outset, Steve Berry captures your interest by pulling the curtain that shrouds the mysteries of the Vatican. It's political entanglements and characters mirrors our contemporary world. He weaves a highly interesting combination of clerical fidelity, celibacy controversy, love story,and church politics with an overarching mystery thriller. Definitely a fast read and worthwhile ride."
2,This is one of the best CDs i've purchased. All of the song are alive and different. Real good bass and good all around audio sound. This currently one of my favorite CDs. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
1,Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
2,"This book is so good that I've loaned it out to others on three seperate occassions (to students who raved about it)and haven't gotten any of the copies back. I provided copies to my children as they entered middle school so they could gain a clearer picture of what the numbers in the newspaper meant. It's a clear and humerous look at how we, as a society, tend to use logic in the most illogical ways. That ""numbers never lie"" is a myth laid to rest. While the examples are old (I did own the original at one point)the concepts they illustrate are still pertinent today. Written in an easily understood format, it also takes the ""fear of statistics"" out of the math-phobic. A great book to have upon the shelf as a ready reference."
2,I Love this book it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . It's not boring either . I love how it describes everything! Definitely a book to get to study for your ASVAB!
1,"This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!"
2,"Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. However, not to be missed or overlooked as one of the btter robot wars themed movies."
1,"I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."
1,"The movie is superb. Putting it on DVD in full format is not. What a waste of $$$! If I pay for a DVD, I expect the letterbox format."
2,"I have 2 Tivo's at home and a Mac running Tivo to Go software and I am constantly moving shows back and fourth between tivos and the computer. I once had this adapter on both TiVo boxes and the transfer rate was decent. I could start a transfer and within a minute start to watch the show being transferred without having any ""pauses"".What I didn't like about this was the design. The foldup antenna piece I think should be more solid or ""lock"" in the up position. I positioned this behind my TV and if a cable hit it, etc the antenna piece woudl fall down and the transfer rate woudl slow considerably.As for installing it, couldn't be easier. Plug it into the tivo, go to your network settings and enter your network information. I had it up and running in less then 5 minutes per tivo and have been running the adapters since 2/2009 so it's been about a year and a half with no issues.I would recommend this."
2,"The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
2,"There is a lot of information and insinuations in this book - so many that I will definitely have to read it over and look deeper into Orwell's meanings. Most of it I did pick up on though and I must say that I love the story as much as I love Orwell's intentions with this book. Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel."
2,"After seeing the preview for the new John Carter movie, I decided to go back and reread the Edgar Rice Burroughs, ""Mars"" series. I'm glad I did. The thrilling tales of battle, adventure, and love on the red planet are just as great as I remembered them. John Carter is a fantastic hero and his name should be right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, Drizzt D'ourdan, and Han Solo.A Princess of Mars"
1,Was a good book in it's time but is out of date now.Don't waste your money. The up to date Black and Decker is probably great.
2,"This comforter is ok for the price.its nto 100% down , so expect some mix.but overall , nice to have a extra ,maybe in the guestroom or so.Overall satisfied."
2,"Imagine your life with the woman you always wanted. Imagine truly and deeply loving the person you are with and she loving you back. Imagine waking up next to an angel. Imagine being grateful for finally being with the woman you dreamed of ever since you can remember but never seemed to be able to get. Imagine finally smiling and taking a deep breath full of happiness. Well, this book can literally change your life from merely imagining to actually making it happen. This book is easy to read and it has hundreds of proven and effective strategies and ideas that will work every single time. When the student is ready the teacher appears. When you're ready for the woman of your dreams this book will be your teacher on to not only how to find and approach her but also on how to have her fall in love with you for ever."
1,"I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it."
1,Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.
1,"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime."
2,"Two things alone on this album from Jason Robert Brown are all you need to be satisfied with the purchase.1) Track #3- ""Someone to Fall Back On"" is one of my all-time favorites of his. It has such a catchy, but soothing, melody line that can't be passed over.2) Lilias White bustin' it out once again on ""Coming Together"" -- adding a glorious rich sound that fans of her will love to play again and again.Few composers/storytellers can tap in to emotion with such satisfying melodies as this gifted musician. Anything he records will gladly be added to my iTunes b/c I can't get enough. Truly wonderful."
2,"first of all, the music on zelda ocarina of time matches the setting you are in. for example, listen to the water temple music. most people get an image of a watery or icy place. the game's songs impressed many people im sure. the game is already great by it self, but the music just takes it to the next level."
2,Product received timely. The plug in feature is favorable in that there is no concern of battery failure. Product is easy to use.
1,"Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing."
1,"All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......"
2,"I rated this book a 5 star book because it had mystery, excitement, true facts, and it was fun to read. I couldn't put the book down. It's one of my favorite books. I can't wait to read another book that's is by Elizabeth George Spear. She's an eccelent writer and she makes a book exciting and not boring like some books. If you haven't read one of her books you better get in style because these books are more than you can explain in words!"
1,"I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet."
2,"This has the more shallow sloped roof tile. There is another type that is steeper. They do connect, they are just not the same pitch.This is an excellent set to be able to get enough roof tiles to actually cover the roof of a house. It is a bit expensive, but it's not too easy to go about it any other way.The doors and windows are a very large scale. They're just fine, too, if you like this size. I'm not a fan, myself--I like the older style of doors and windows. But those are basically out of production. I would think most kids would be fine with them."
1,"The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out. This one was quite disappointing, since the limericks it contains appear as continuous text, so are quite inconvenient to read. It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!"
1,"Suprised with all the positive reviews for this album, since this is one of Too Short's weaker albums. There are a few enjoyable tracks here, but nothing to write home about. ""Shorty the Pimp"" and ""Get in where you fit in"" are so much stronger, that this I wouldnt bother with this one."
2,Nobody can discuss serious philosophical issues in hysterically funny ways like Terry Pratchett. Small gods is as intelligent exploration of theology and people's relationship to religion as you'll find but if that's not what you want to take from it you'll have a great time laughing through the book. The Turtle Moves.
1,This is easily one of the worst shows I have seen. With only 45mins to work with there is no character development and the monster designs and fight scenes are nothing special. The final battle is contrived and nothing is resolved. I'm a die-hard fan of anime and it was actually painful to watch this. I reget getting it. With all the good stuff out there pass this one up and get something else.
1,"I would not recommend this product.Tents are lots of fun for all kids, HOWEVER this tent is NOT just a pop-up tent. It take some time to set up and the poles are not durable or safe.My kids have used it for two days, and the wooden poles that hold up the tent split down the middle.I had to tape them back together and I, myself have gotten a deep splinter.For the amount of money I spent on this item I would have expected better quality.I would not recommend this product as a play item."
2,"Is interesting, but quite repetitive. The Greatest Generation holds your interest though. I think the book is a bit long."
1,"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."
2,"I'm wearing these bad boys right now. These sneakers have a sexy look to them, and you can't go wrong with classic chucks at this price. Buy them! Every one should have black and white sneakers in their collection. They feel great, and I haven't had any problems with them yet. This is well worth the purchase. :-)"
1,"When publishers abridge classics such as The Wind in the Willows they must be very respectful. And they should not make their own determinations of what a child can and cannot absorb or enjoy. It is very sad that they cut ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" from this edition. Children can and will get something valuable from such contemplatve texts, but only if we allow them access!"
2,"I take photos of antique prints for sale in a controlled condition (photo lights, etc), making correct color of utmost importance. The card is small to set the white balance on my camera, but works wonderfully with Adobe Lightroom to set the custom white balance. I am new to photography, but have found that this combination is working well for me."
1,Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use! Didn't work worth a DAMN!
1,"Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging."
1,The soles and laces of these sandals do not flex with your feet. Says it is leather but the laces feel like plastic. Very uncomfortable especially for dancing. Thin soled or would be good for every day use.
2,"As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
2,"I'm an Australian, born and bred, biased, yes! . . . but this bitta (bit of) Australian musical history is brilliant . . just watching the video right now! Please, Amazon . . . release the video in NTSC format so I can share the experience with my North American and other Wolfish friends in other parts of the world!! Pat Hewett (Wachita to her friends) from Western Australia."
1,"I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot. It went on easily, but after it dried, it peeled right off the leather part of the boot,and I was able to peel it off the rest. The product was also shiny, very unlike the original rand. I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application."
1,"I keep trying Pampers. With my daughter, they leaked and didn't fit well. With my son, I have tried Baby Dry and Cruisers at different stages and still, they fit awful. The tabs feel cheap and they don't stretch as well as Huggies. I give up on Pampers. Some store brand diapers fit and stretch better."
2,"One of the Best Books for an introduction to Sci/fi writing. When I first read this book years ago I said that to a friend of mine, and it still holds true today. One of the very few books i will read over again every year or two. Thankfully its just as good then as well. If you want an enjoyable read, that leaves you smiling at the end this is it."
2,"Venus Johnson seems to have is going on. SHe has a good career, a doctor for a boyfriend and long pretty hair. But she is not happy. Venus decides to make some changes and the first thing to go is the boyfriend, then the hair. Cutting off the hair is not easy. As any black woman can tell you, its hard being a slave to the hair. You know the horror stories, of the pressing comb, perms, and hours at the hair salon, but it seems your hair can dictate your self worth. This was happening with Venus. It was fun to read the reactions of others to her new look, new attitude. I found this book to be very interesting. THe characters were funny, interesting and someone you know you already know. It was also encouraging to watch Venus come to terms with herself, her life and her relationships. This was a very interesting read. One I highly recommend"
1,nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
2,"I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature."
2,"I saw this movie ""golden earings"" when I was a kidand I always wanted to see it agan. now I own a copyof it. It was great"
2,"For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
2,"This is great book on how to set up affiliate programs. It really goes in depth & walks you through in a step by step manner. Whether you are a novice or a pro on the web, this book will definately help you create, manage, and improve your affiliate program."
1,"I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"
1,"I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking of. I'm a fan of Ian Richardson but he's awful in this and this version of the story is likewise awful. Save your money because it'll be a waste if you buy this tape. I know, I know, you'd think he'd be great at this role but it's a big disappointment."
1,Brokaw has managed to take wonderful raw material and produce a book that would not challenge a junior high school student. The book is shallow and banal. I am sorry I wasted my money on it and even sorrier that he will receive it. Surely a man who makes his living with words can do better than this.
2,"&#65279;1. Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song."""
2,This movie IS Batman. Everyone (except young children) will love this movie. Period. Gary Oldman is great as Sgt. Gordon. The origins of the Batman legends are very well handled.
2,"In all honesty I'm not a fan of the whole American Idol thing, but I did get sucked into AI2 just a bit. Yea for Clay! Moving on.This is strictly a pop album. No earth shattering lyrics, but plenty of catchy tunes and choruses. Clay does a wonderful job of singing this material. In a way Clay reminds me of Rick Ashley from the 80's because I didn't expect that voice/power to come from that person. Anyway, I have been enjoying this ablum. It's nice, mellow and light hearted. Good for those laid back moods or wanting to relax.Obviously this album is not for everyone, but give it a chance. It may grow on you."
1,"I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."
1,"I bought a brand new Roadtrek Motorhome that came equipped with this unit. It was hooked up to a TV antenna and a DVD player and Dolby Surround Sound, but had room for several more component and HD connections.It worked nicely with the integrated system in the Motorhome... for about 10 minutes. It died, no power whatsoever. I tried outside power, etc., no help.I tried the Samsung website to register it, but it was a Canadian model (where the Motorhome was built), and I couldn't register it on the US site, nor could I register it on the Canadian site since it only allows you to enter Provinces, not States.However, I did call Samsung the next day, they asked for the Serial Number, and that was all it took for them to send a replacement to a local UPS store. Alas, my trip is already planned, so I won't get it till I return, but I am very pleased with the Customer Service and only hope the next unit (re manufactured) works."
2,"My Fiance are fans of Smallville. We have all the seasons now. We loved season 9, can't wait till the final season comes out to complete our collection."
1,A shoot em up about a group of air crash survivors stranded on a desert island.This ragtag bunch soon find themselves fighting terrorists bent on taking over the United States with the aids virus.Made by the creators of the toxic avenger this frequently tastless flick combines violent action with totally deadpan comedy.Two versions R rated and Directors cut directors cut has way more gore than the R rated.
1,Don't be fooled by the perfect cut of the countries on the box cover. I bought this for my [...] thinking the pieces were actually in the shape of the countries and it would be a good learning tool. Not quite. Some were. Most were not. Some countries were so small they were difficult to read. This will be in our next garage sale.Springbok puzzles are still the best.
1,"The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
2,"The Air TV series is one of the greatest drama's I have ever seen.To say the character design, art, and story are memorable is an extreme understatement.The inclusion of the OVA episodes makes this an incredible value.As with all things, I strongly recommend watching it in it's original language (Japanese in this case)with English subtitles so that you can experience it the way the director intended.Overall: I strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys dramas"
1,"Not sure why there's such a love-fest here over this charger?? Fact is, we're talking about roughly eight bucks in parts & plastic that Canon is marking up too much. After spending so much on the camera, it's insulting to the notion of ""customer service"" that they are charging this price for a replacement charger. At least they could make it a rapid-charger enhancement or something - after all, why should it take two hours to re-charge your camera?Listen Canon, if you want five-stars from customers, treat us better, and sell replacement parts at cost. No need to take advantage of us just because we lose a part that makes our wonderful camera as useful as a stone."
2,"This book covers all emotions experienced by human beings successfully: rage, sadness, happiness...There are already many good reviews for this book out there, so I won't write paragraphs. I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic. After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading. It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web. I am searching for A Joy in the Morning, and will probably enjoy it just as much."
2,"...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!"
2,I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity.
2,"As an instructor of business writing, the exercises in the text are excellent. The chapters a bit dense for the casual student. However, the overall work teaches and focuses on true problems in the work place. The e-mail and memo writing materials nail it."
1,"Poor quality, the picture looks very bad. It seems as recorded with a VHS camera in the cinema. Do not recommend"
1,"My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this movie but you might find it boring a bit.I dont recommend this to people who enjoy movies that have a good story and directing."
1,It was the most exciting movie ever but Mr.Krabs was barly in the movie and sandy or squidward wern't ethier.
1,"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The ""twist"" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."
2,"this was a low budget film, but for it's time i found it to be scary, viewed this film at the age of nine and kept me awake. took notice a crash sequence was borrowed from another film. this movie is well worth purchasing for zombie movie fan's."
1,"this book may be easy to study for english literature, being short. However, this story is not interesting in the least, with a plot that builds up and then is thrown away totally at the end."
2,"It may not have the most complicated, interwoven plot, but what can I say, I like it. Kit fits fits perfectly into the time period without becoming one of those overly sugary ""porceline dolls"" which is what happens to many of the characters in all kinds of historical fiction because the author is not quite sure how the characters of the past should react. It's interesting to watch as Kit tries to fit into her surroundings, but then finds out she can't. She is who she is, and would be who she is. So soon she learns a way out of the suffering of being different but has another problem--her unique character and ""evil"" way of dressing lead the people of her town to believe she's a witch. Now she must rely one the people she trusts most to save her, and hope that some of the people she found hopelessly mistrustful of her would find a way to forgive for being different."
1,We have a 5mo old baby boy and his 18pounds not 19 just yet. We just bought the #3 on 3/5/12. This size leaks everything!I rate #3 A BIG ZERO. Don't get us wrong we loved loved loved #1 & 2's maybe because it had the leak lock.#3 is not made right. The plastic inside directs anything..pee or poop right out. Our baby leaked both things from the back and around the thighs. OMG we had to change his entire outfit 4 times in one day.I wish we can get our money back but we threw the box in trash =( Diapers are expensive. Stores should have some sort of policy where parents can get their money back esp if they have not opened the 2nd pack and hardly used the 1st.I will keep you posted what happens and what we find that works for us. Good luck everyone
1,The product which I received was different from other store.It was not soft and comfortable for baby as usual.I don't know why the product was different from the previous ordered one.Worst product that I've ever received.
2,"While reading the book I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. In this journey, I explored the different sides of Greeks and how even today their strong sense of self emerges in their daily lives. The book creates a bridge between the past and the present revealing that Ulysses journey to come back home represents our own desire to attain fulfillment."
2,"This book is worth it for the early discussion on the Catholic faith and then Dr. Schreck's discussion of Justification by faith and works. If you are like me, you might have a Protestant view of salvation. For me I could never quite reconcile this view with the book of James. If you are not quite sure of the Chhurch's position on faith, grace, works, salvation, etc., this book places it all in perspective and clearly explained. Th eother parts of the book were interesting, but not like the first third of the book."
2,This book has informed me of things I have never known. I watch a lot of crime shows but Mark and John go behind the scenes and explain how the actual process works. The difficulties of solving a crime and making sure you have the right person. Very interesting read. Could not put it down.
1,"Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood."
2,"How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under? Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang. The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence ""Mad"" Max. Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase scenes."
2,"YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
2,"I didn't think much of this album when I first got it and listened to it, but after a couple of listens, I really liked it. In fact, it's probably one of my favourite Hollies albums. I usually listen to my music on my ipod or my itunes on shuffle, and whenever I hear a Hollies song that I don't really know but I really like what I hear, it's usually from this album. So I would definitely recommend it even if you are not a hard-core Hollies fan!!"
1,it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library.
2,I think the album is tight. The album Sweatsuit has some of his best songs on it from his Sweat and Suit albums. It also has 3 new songs on it.Go cop this Sweatsuit album.
1,"I read the reviews before I buy this, I don't know how others are not have the issue I had. Every one says this baby dry diaper is very perfect for their kid. But one couple of them mentioned it is leaking. The same thing happened with our kid. The first time I used this we saw the leak all over his dress and we thought we haven't dressed him perfectly. But that's not true, every time we used this diaper there is leak almost 4 times out of 5. We are not at all happy with this product. Before using this we tried Cruisers and that one is perfect. Just that because this baby dry is little cheaper than cruisers we thought of giving it a try. We learned the lesson that cheap ones wil not the great ones always. I would not recommend this to any one."
2,"I had not been familiar with the myth of Psyche nor with the writing of C.S. Lewis prior to picking this book up, so I walked into this story with no preconceived notions at all. I really enjoyed the plot and characters, especially for the first half or so. Then, the book became quite bizarre and abstract, and I personally became less engaged. It wasn't until the last 20 pages or so that I once again was pulled back in. Lewis helps the reader gain perspective and insight into what we have read, and this is what helped make the story worthwhile. I am not sure I would read other Lewis novels -- not being a fan of fantasy or a particularly religious person -- but I am glad that I read this one."
1,"The 2 stars goes to Timothy Hutton for his great performance, truly an outstanding actor! But... the movie... well not so great. I was left somewhat disappointed. It starts well and gives you the impression of a good movie but then it evolves into a bizarre scenario that completely fails to keep up the suspenseful tone of the start, and is in fact rather wearisome and inconclusive at times. It's as if they are trying really hard to achieve a goal with a poor script... I expected more that's all..."
1,I saw the original movie made in 1963 and it was wonderful. I was very anxious for this remake to come out and man was I disappointed!! It was horrible!
2,I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.
1,"Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
2,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Anyone who has ever undergone a painful divorce will relate to this movie. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I did not feel that Lane's acting was overdone. The angst of betrayal and divorce is just that, angst.The movie also had its delightfully quirky moments and while it was heavily salted and peppered with typical love story fare, it was also full of marvelous insights.Life marches on and there are opportunities at every turn."
2,The screws in my favorite rimless readers kept coming loose and since I wear contacts I can't see well up close to tighten them. This product makes tightening them easy. It is difficult to change the heads for other glasses though.
1,"I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
2,hearing about how this Musical Genius made this Landmark album is a real treat.it's a timeless video about a timeless ARTIST that Trenscended music&time.
1,"My expectations were very high when I bought this DVD. The first 45 minutes of the movie were a little slow, but seemed to be building up some momentum. The first 15 minutes of cave diving with the bush league spilunkers was OK!. After that, the flick just turned into another slasher movie in a cave. The darkness added little and the plastic vampires were a little too stupid to watch. Nothing more than a slashers flick! What a total disappointment."
1,A little bit slow at some points but other than that pretty good. I like the part where mercy is in love with John
2,"This is one of the more entertaining books I have ever read. The characters are well-developed, the story is exciting, unexpected and largely believable, and the events and setting took me to a strange land north of where I live, but had never really considered before.Apparently this was part of Michener's book on Alaska, and would have made a nice addition to that book. This rivals the chapter in Alaska dealing with the Chilcott Pass."
2,"Love the Wild Animals lunchbox. It's more like - zoo animals.It has a good, thick amount of insulation and is free of harmful plastics, etc. It's also a lot roomier than your average lunchbox and I like this because it leaves extra room for more freezer blocks to keep everything very cold. We also send two drinks, one for lunch and one for snacktime and the extra room is great!I agree with others about this being difficult to clean, so we send a paper plate and have the little one eat outside of the lunchbox, so we don't wind up with crumbs, etc inside the interior seams, problem solved.It's also nice to have a lunchbox that not every kid has, so he knows which one is his. This will probably last the entire school year and that's good for a fabric lunchbox. I would buy this again and will get another next year."
1,"system didnt fit right and leaked at front flange and it makes no sound at all very quiet , not as loud as stockdo yourself a favor and buy a 50 or 40 series ,do not be fooled by this junk"
2,"El primer libro del Dr. Weiss sigue siendo un gran libro para todos aquellos a quienes les inquieta el tema de la reencarnacin, as no crean en ella."
1,"I cannot review the actual product, since I still have not received it. No sense in ordering this using amazon prime, as it has been 8 days since my initial order, and FedEx doesn't even have the package, even though it was marked as shipped. Disappointing, as this was for a gift, and now must find an alternative. If I do ever get the package, I'll be returning it.Do not order from this vendor. I will update my review if possible if this ever arrives."
2,"Art Tatum's playing on this album is truly amazing. It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius. However, the sound quality really turned me off when I was first listening to the record. Its hard to not notice the fuzz, and if I feel that the record deserves a 4.5, nothing lower, which is why I rated it a 5."
2,When you think of all the material that has been released out on CD. Why is this not available in North America. C'mon Warner!
1,"I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying."
2,"In addition to rice I use this for cooking Irish oatmeal which is a bother to cook on the stovetop because it wants to foam up/boil over and stick to the bottom of the pot requiring you to stand over it for 30-40 minutes. The Zojirushi, however, can be set the night before and in the morning you have perfectly cooked oatmeal and little mess.Less hassle in the morning than instant! I can hardly believe it. Used it for about 6 years now. My favorite kitchen gadget.Edit May 1 2009 - About 10 yrs old and still going strong. The internal battery (that keeps the digital clock going) still works!"
1,"Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this."
2,"The $100.00 dollar Audio Source Amp 100 took its place in my music room and was integrated into my $ 20,000 McIntosh system to provide some center channel sweetness by driving a pair of Focal SIB .5's. So far, it is performing in a most satisfactory manner and is doing exactly what I purchased it to do. I also use it alone with the Focals when recording albums and cassettes to CD, when I do not need to use my McIntosh amp and Phase Technology 10.5 Phase Coherent speakers. It does not run hot even when being pushed, and has shown no signs of clipping at moderately high volume levels. If it is hooked up correctly and manufacturer reccomendations are followed, I see no reason for problems some other reviewers encountered."
2,Many young pianists have the manual skills and dexterity to master these pieces but . . . the feeling and interpretation that Ms Bardin brings to us here in nothing less than marvelous. She puts you in another world.
1,"While Godard's classic, breathless, is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made, the version released from the International Film Series is nearly unwatchable. It is terribly overexposed, washing out much of the picture detail, and making most of the white-on-white subtitles impossible to read. In addition, (I am unsure if this is unique to my particular copy) the video tends to ghost, and in places appears pink with a moving vertical (this is definately not a tracking problem, rather a glitch with the copy of the film this tape was recorded from). I would recommend this film to anyone, however it might be best to purchase the other version."
2,"Works great and compact and convenient. The detachable lanyard is nice for when I don't want to carry my pack with me. I don't see myself using the white and black cards too often, but they're nice to have. The cards are of a nice quality, thick enough to not bend accidentally when in the camera bag."
2,"I knew Richard Bradford when he was just out of Tulane University and I was married to one of his best friends. He claims this book not to be autobiographical but there are some similarities and I cannot help but believe that some of the adventures of he and Steenie are based on his friendship with my husband. The book is a masterpiece and I have read it often since it was first published in 1968. His second book ""So Far from Heaven"" is just as clever and regrettably impossible to find. ""Red Sky at Morning"" remains a classic."
2,"Let me say that I have the first album, and love that, and this is just as good. It's got the same attitude and is still heavy. It may have a few more slower songs, but they're just as good in their own way. If you liked the first one, you should like this one, and if you're a fan of hard rock, then you should like this."
2,Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.
2,I like the movie... Spongebob is charlie brown's counterpart who just happens to live in a pineapple under the sea....
2,"This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work."
1,"Barely applies any heat to the cup. Fresh-off-the-stove water was luke-warm within 15 minutes. Very poor, and highly disappointing, performance. Would never buy another ""Mr. Coffee"" cup warmer."
1,"DO NOT GET THIS VERSION. It is a scam. Literally. It contains acts 1 and two, and then skips right to act 5. The text has obviously been copied and pasted from various sources, it randomly switches between paragraph form and iambic pentameter.The image on the front and back is pixel-y, someone with little knowledge of image editing applied it.This isn't even a good forgery. I could tell something was wrong the moment I picked it up."
1,"Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page. If you hate it, you'll hate the rest. If you love it, you'll love the rest. The quality of the writing stays fairly consistent."
2,"I have yet to 'feild' test this books info yet, but I couldn't put it down. I read it front to back right away and have been designing/planing while reading. I never thought I'd get so into horticulture. This book has me really excited about growing canibus becaused it's so much more than putting some seeds in some soil and watering it. There is a real science/art to growing WELL and this book seems to cover it all from start to finish and after. There is practical help for those who wish to grow in countries where it's illegal, (sound advice from experianced people who grow and have done so for years). I haven't read any other books on this subject to compare it too but I am very pleased with this book and feel I don't need another with more info. To say there are a few gramarical errors in this book is an understatment, but I see this as a testiment to the quality of what they have grown, (or at least what the editor was smoking)."
2,"The title of this film was originally ""Next"". The film had a great plot and action which kept one on the edge of one's seat.It would be helpful to put the title ""Next"" by the new title so that buyers know that this is the same movie.Sincerely,Terra Schoenberg-JohnsonDave Johnson (husband)"
1,"I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
1,"I have used the baby dry diapers for months now. The last two boxes I have recieved do not have as much of the blue absorbant material and the diapers are overall totally different (almost flat). Although the diapers worked well for awhile, the new design leaves much to be desired."
2,"Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra (""Queer Notions"" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry ""Red"" Alllen's slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad ""I Cover the Waterfront"" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20's and 30's was a bit more advanced..."
2,I read this book in one day. That's a big deal for me. I thought the author did a fantastic job.
2,"This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray."
2,"If you enjoy bad scripts, bad actors poor film quality that was the early 70's, this is right up your alley."
1,"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
2,I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a hard to put down. The author really brings out the liveliness of the characters. I don't usually read books twice but I would pick this one up and read it again
2,"For non-native speakers this is a God send, the CD provides both British and American pronunciation and I consider this is the most useful feature for this dictionary.Once you installed the CD to your hard drive in full installation mode, then store your CD in a safe place because you don't need it anymore.I highly recommend this to anyone who have a hard time to find how to pronoun the English words."
1,"Worst video ever!!!!! Don't waste your money. Poor poor video quality, people walk in front of the camera shots. The video has bird, frog and other various sounds that have nothing to do with the bird or animal on the poor quality video. You won't like it, your cat won't like it, and that is an understatement."
1,"Very hard to put on, they are not very big, and I am a slender petite woman with little hands & wrists, but it feels like I am scraping my skin to get them on and off, do not care to wear them at all. Look nice, built well, but need to make bigger. Going to see if I can return them or resell them myself."
1,"This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a ""CLASSIC""?"
1,"Ok, when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic! (I still can't) After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars. Also, it is one of the better books that I had to read for school. I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more. I still wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone"
2,"Converse All Star are made to feel comfortable, this kind of shoes is never out of fashion, with jeans or shorts, wit t-shirts or shirts, once you wear a pair you will wish to have all of them."
2,a few things:1. the beatles are my favorite band ever.2. this does not sound like the beatles. people who say it mimics them or trys to imitate them are just lazy reviewers. noel does steal his fair share past brit rockers though.3.it's up there for me with van halen I and appetite with destruction as the best debut's ever. it's just pure rock n' roll with great vocals and loud guitars.4. this is oasis' best album. the vocals are better in morning glory and the songs are more mainstream but this one is jamming.
2,"By far- i must say, this must be one of the best movies during its time with an all black cast. The enterntain was great, but it had a creative storyline that went right along with what was going on in the film."
1,"I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality."
2,Everyone needs to read this classic. An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers. I really appreciated it a lot.
2,"Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
1,"BORING. I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book."
2,"We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal."
2,Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance. No deep background in math is required to have a good grasp of this book. I believe it is intuition rather than fancy skills that is important to build up interest and passion for studying a hard topic such as continuous-time finance.
2,"The book arrived in a little more time than I expected, but it was within the time frame indicated. However, I am happy with the book's condition. It's better that described. Great book and price."
1,"Was starting to swell, which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent"
1,"I thought it was going to be THE PRODUCT that I wanted. But it wasn't. I bought it to get rid of my blackheads, but it doesn't do anything."
2,"I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you."
2,Good movie .. and best actor for this character to date.
1,Not what I expected. Too much acting. Disappointing to say the least. I will not buy the like again. Oh well.
2,It was a wonderful well written Book!!! I have read many of Julie Garwood books and I love them all. This was one of my first that I read of hers and I loved it!!!
1,"I was disappointed in this video. I was looking forward to doing a routine with my 5+ year old and trying to start her on self-regulatory techniques. The video merely did a well-paced run through of various poses, but gave no structure or routine to follow. Most disappointing."
1,The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Do not buy- very poor product.
2,"Jessie Woods,my great great Aunt, has had such a wonder and histerical life. Her facinating stories of her early life as a wing walker, have been put in a book that couldn't of been written any better. I would recomend this book to any one who is looking for a good laugh and some teeth gripping tales o walking on the wing."
1,"I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music."
2,"I have had Clay's album for 2 1/2 months (since it first came out), and I have to say I don't get tired of listening to it. Some say this album doesn't have anything special on it, and that it doesn't show off the range of Clay's voice. I have to disagree with those who find fault with the album. Clay has a phenomenal voice, and I am sure that we will be hearing much more from him in the years to come."
2,"Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a book of this nature on hand, literally."
1,"Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying."
2,"The Pills are gel caps a lil larger than i thought they would be ,but i bought this to clear up acne and control pms symptoms and so far i love it and my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days so i would reccomend this to every one also a plus my cervical mucus is back i was dry before so i just love this product"
1,"When purchasing this from Amazon Prime (not a third-party seller), the item that you will receive is not the Mega Playland, but rather the Megaland model. It has three compartments and two tunnels but is a a much different configuration. It can only be configured in an ""L"", not a straight line like the pictured Mega Playland model."
1,"I love period films, but I did not enjoy this one. The plot was thin, I thought the acting was well done."
2,Fierce symbolisms that rips out the guts of whitebread America. The most profound gem is Burrough's prediction of the AIDS crisis. He was able to capture in this book the symptoms he saw develop in the homosexual underground years before it was announced to the world at large.
1,It sounds somewhat incomplete and boring to me to listen similar kind of tunes through out the whole thing. Still better than figure head type musician but not as good as I hoped. Felt this is the limit of her or the producer so I don't plan to buy next album if same producer.
1,"This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS."
1,Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
2,It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today.
2,"Not sure about the biblical references but movie-wise, I like it. It was unpredictable which is good, there were twists and turns, the tension was there throughout the movie, nice special effects, so it's a good movie overall. I would watch it again if I could."
1,I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
2,"This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching."
1,"While this book is not the most expensive on the market, it appears to have been created from a 'boiler-plate' of a series of canine books. Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as ""Read through it once and then never refer to it again"".There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"
1,"I have been trying to find videos I can play on my Amazon Prime Roku box for my kitties. I have one really great video, Feline Frolics, which I Highly recommend. This one, however, is terrible. It starts out with a bunch of ducks and goes on and on and on and on..with the ducks. The sounds are ok but get very annoying after awhile. They have, of all things, a turtle. ( blinks) I am not sure why they have a turtle..They also have a crocodile.. and only 1 short scene of an aquarium!! ~ and that one was at the end. The scenes are entirely too long to keep my cats attention and are exceedingly boring. I am SO glad I didn't purchase the full version. Do not waste your money..... Amazon please find more cat movies to show on PRIME.. I love the Frolics one!!!"
1,"This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
2,"Good product, minorly difficult to fold back up, but kids enjoyed it greatly. It was a good deal for the money."
1,"Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray."
2,"Let me preface this review with the statement that I was supposed to have read this book years ago, when I was still an English Major and for some reason or not I never got to it. I now understand why it is considered a must read and classic. Its a great book with such insight to our culture that I now regret greatly not reading it sooner."
2,I bought these for myself because I have arthritis and it makes card playing much easier and more enjoyable. My elderly father also uses them. They're sturdy and stand by themselves.
1,being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake.
2,"A thorough and useful book. Shows practical ways and guidelines/checklists to evaluate whether the school is teaching your kids, or wasting their time. While the book concentrates on helping your kids take advantage of (or survive!) public schools and other schools, there is also a lot of fascinating info showing how the schools have degenerated and why.One of the most useful parts of the book is factual and practical advice about dealing with schools and problem teachers. For example, what to do if your kid is assigned to a useless stupid and incompetent teacher. A situation which, in these days of affirmative action and ""dumbing down,"" occurs far too often."
2,I found myself looking for the introduction of other super heroes with in smallville series. I was sick for four weeks and this and the other eight series keep me from getting bored. I couldn't believe Superman did not wear his cape and tights until the very last show.
2,"What a wonderful imagination Beth Hilgartner has! . I was totally immersed in the world she has created. Her characters are super; the plot kept me on the edge of my chair. What a good read! When will the next one be out, Beth?"
2,"Great subsitute for sony memory stick. cost less, same quality"
2,"The animated opening credits were amazing, the story was very, very clever, the editing made perfect sense, and the camera work was great--a real grand slam, especially when achieved in a small, independent film. It was truly a delight to watch Bite Marks--they all did outrageous work. I don't think I'll ever sit though a strictly-horror film, but this film was hilarious. Thank you Mark Bessinger for putting your thoughts to film."
2,"This book is described on how-to-learn-any-language.com as ""the most comprehensive Estonian course available"". Unfortunately Amazon does not offer the 32 audio CDs/tapes that are integral to the course. Eight of the first nine units of audio are available free online at Indiana University. The complete course (text and audio) is available at Audio Forum and Multilingual Books.See you at the Song and Dance Celebration in July 2009!"
2,"Seriously, I may never read this, but I do love how easy it was to purchase and put on my iPad."
1,"I own the boxset of Nirvana and its good. It took awhile to come out, but it was worth it. Now this? A cd that takes the best moments from the box and adds three new tracks? How much more will fans have to suffer? Whats next for fans? Kurt's legacy is like 2Pac and being crapped on but his greedy friends and family. I cant wait for Scott Stapp to produce the next Nirvana ""lost cd""!"
1,Right in the middle of the Batman Begins DVD I received from AbundaTrade the movie froze and wouldn't pick up again until 2 or 3 scenes before the end of the movie. I will never purchase anything from AbundaTrade ever again.
2,"Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
1,"While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's. But that is the point! Gammell's work is more effective, it is REAL art, not merely illustration.For the sake of your children's AESTHETIC development, do the right thing!"
2,very happy with this electric pump inflatable airbed - understandable directions -very easy to inflate with electric pump - confortable to lie on especially withheadrest - easy to store with its own bag - I'm entirely satisfied with thisproduct from Amazon
2,"When I first saw this movie had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it.I knew that Sho was.Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good.JCVD really out classed Sho in this one.I give them both 10's anyway.The way that they interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie will like this one.It's not just a martial arts movie."
2,"The story is wafer thin and it matters little. There is more crammed in this little unsung film than most comedies. Despite the racist undertones, Rochester shows why he was regarded as such a great comic actor. It is a pity he did not make more films as he seems the equal of Bob Hope as the scared driver of Topper.Indeed the whole film is a battle between which lunatic can hold the camera for more than a few seconds. There is just too much going on. I particularly liked Topper's wife who was so dizzy and stole scene after scene. It is a who dunnit, but that really does not matter as it is all great fun.Sit back and enjoy a piece of nonsense."
1,"I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."
1,"Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money."
2,"smallville is one of my favorite shows, so i can't say nothing negative about it.. at least of the top of my head lol. the product came onetime, if i remember correctly i think i did the one-day delivery.. so that was good."
1,Reminds me of buble gum pop too much. I hate it. It was one ofthe worse cds ever. I am gonna sell it and get my money back.
2,"This book does a great job describing the society and people in it, but if you're reading it for the great action scenes, you might want to look elsewhere. This book is considered a classic for a reason. It actually makes the reader think and contemplate the future of our society compared to the one in the book. So if you're in the mood for a good sc-fi read, I would suggest reading this."
1,"The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves."
1,We used Pampers swadlers and loved them. When we switched to size 4 we decided on Pampers Baby Dry. What a mistake! Every morning we woke up to our son completely wet. These diapers do not hold enough water!
1,"Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though. Somehow thought the cheese would be in a gift box similar to the one shown, not just stuffed into dismal styrofoam. I'm not certain what to make of the leaking eplorateur that was rewrapped in some plastic wrap....hmmm..wonder if it was shipped out that way or someone had opened the container -it's below freezing here, so doubt it ""thawed"" en routewill probably go out for dinner or to the jeweler next year"
2,"First let me say that I've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent. This scale agrees with the one in my doctor's office, so seems to be accurate. If you get off to re-weigh yourself, it will give you the same result again. You won't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale, or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot, so it is consistent. It could be a little sturdier, but it's fine for home use. We've had it for at least a year or two with no problems. I give it 5 stars for home use."
1,"Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."
2,"I don't find Pure to be very green but it is floral. It opens with a white floral POW!, likely the lily & freesia combination, but it quickly mellows into a soft, soapy floral. JB78 review is spot-on with his review of Pure as a sheer floral that's marine fresh. Pure was launched about the time as Happy & Pleasures, but I find Pure to be more likable nearly 15 years after launch.Pure is one of those fragrances that is easy to put on & easy to wear. Clean & feminine. Something to wear when you don't know what to wear. Everyone should have a perfume like that in their wardrobe - this is mine."
1,When this product arrived parts were missing. When we tried to assemble it the welded joints fell apart. I wouldn't waste the money. Buy another type bag holder.
2,"This box is very large, and contains 204 size 3 diapers. I love purchasing this product from Amazon because if I am using my Amazon Mom account, I save 30%, which makes these much less expensive than even at Wal-Mart."
1,"A friend gave me this book as a gift because she had found it to be ""hilarious.""Huh?I have to admit that the only reason I finished this book was that I was trying desparately to find something, anything, funny in it. Unfortunately, the story was ponderous, depressing, and egregiously pretentious from beginning to end."
1,"I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. It fails miserably as it produces so much hiss it is unusable. I mean it is poor with a captital P.The phantom power does not work when in battery mode, nor does the clipping LED's. Keep on looking if you want portability."
1,This book's got coffee stain all over and in the poorest condition. Can't believe i paid 5 dollars for this crap
1,"This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now."
1,"The kit I received is not the one in the picture, it says it should fit a 99 civic, but does not even come close. The instructions are EXTREMELY vague and do not provide any clarity at all as to what brackets to remove or use. IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT!!! I attempted to contact customer service and i got what sounded like a crappy home answering machine. Now I have a disassembled car with no radio and no way to mount it. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN! Do yourself a favor and find another mounting kit if you have a 99 civic, this is not a mounting kit for a 99 civic. Such a scam."
1,"This has to be their most overrated album. ""Live Forever"" however is a song that must not be ignored. It is probably one of Oasis's best songs to date. ""Slide Away"" and ""Married with Children"" are decent but are far from amazing. I suggest to just buy the single."
1,"They should have called this product lemon vaseline. The scent is nice, but it almost isn't a scrub at all; it's got some granulated sugar among a sea of greasy pommade. It leaves skin sticky and does not wash off. Do not buy this product if you're expecting an actual exfoliator!"
1,This is not Lighthouse. This is the ST Luke UMC Lighthouse Praise Band. I am returning it to Amazon because it looks like Chrstian filler.
1,Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
1,I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that couldn't be patched due to the fabric. It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it.
1,"The quality of cotton used on this product is not good. It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles, despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press+wrinkle guard setting. I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product."
2,"I've listened to this CD over and over and it gets better every time. My favorites keep changing every day. Today I woke up humming ""Perfect Day"". Yesterday, it was ""The Way"". My tastes in music cover a wide range and I don't expect Clay to cover them all. So if you only like hip-hop, rap or hard rock you won't like it. But if you like listening to a beautiful passionate voice sing love songs, pop ballads and light rock this is a must buy."
2,"Never mind that Alec Guinness plays a Japanese businessman. He does so well, you forget after awhile that he doesn't look Japanese.This film, which came out in the very early 60's I think, is based on a play by Leonard Spiegelgass. Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its ""modernity,"" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I'm so glad this film has finally been put on DVD."
2,Clay is sooooooooooooo delicious. Everytime I listen to this masterpiece I like it even more! For the first time in my life I have been brought to tears by a VOICE.
2,"My daughter loves beanie babies, This has got to be one of the cutest, that little face in all of that fuzzy-ness OMGoodness. Very Cute"
2,"The mix is good, and I liked almost all the tracks, but there was just something misssing in the cd that only TGN2 had. There was more hard trance/goa in TGN2, and TGN3 is more regular trance, which is still really good. My favorite track on this cd is ""Madagascar"" by Art of Trance, it just has an awesome background beat. I'm a stern follower of the TGN series, and I think it's one of the better trance mix series out there. TGN3 is a great cd, and I recommend it to anyone who is a trance lover, or hasn't experienced trance yet. Better yet, get this and TGN2, and you'll really be trancin' it up! =)"
2,"I've had this outside my kitchen door for a couple of months. It's great at cleaning shoes (I do a lot of gardening and yard work), it's holding up well, and the rubber base is very solid."
1,Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.
1,"It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
1,"I enjoyed The Wedding Singer, I honestly did. I thought Sandler and Barrymore had good chemistry, the script was entertaining, there were some good jokes... and most of all it refrained from being corny, slow and boring. Now lets take 50 First Dates. Lets take out the good chemistry (what happened? God knows!), the entertaining script (boo, bum and vomit gags only go so far), and any good jokes and what do you have? This film! Ok, it's not as bad as, lets say, Mr Deeds or Little Nicky, but it was a massive disapointment. It came across like a last minute idea Sandler and his buddies had while vacationing in Hawaii and though, ah hell, lets do a version of Groundhog Day here and pass it off as a movie!Do yourself a favour. You want to watch 'a nice romantic comedy'... rent When Harry Met Sally. Wit over crass wins everytime!"
2,I have already used this item several times. It is quick and efficient. I have not had any problems. I am glad I purchased it. I'm not a technically inclined person so it is simple to use. I was pleased with the quality of the product. It was shipped very quickly and arrived at my home within a couple of days. I was impressed with this also.
1,"This is something that's been on my list for months and I have no idea what it is, it sends me to a non-existent link."
2,"Well, I heard from other mom's about buying diapers from amazon and let me say they were right! Affordable price, quick delivery and right on time for my growing infant! A +++"
1,Poor sound quality when paired with T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA.
2,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."
1,"Does this guy tape record himself at night? For more grade school poetry, nonsensical statements, and Haiku's written by dumb people go out and get this CD ASAP."
2,"This is a first, truly a first....The FIRST time I purchased an album that had NO throwaway songs. Every single cut is fantastic. Some are edgy, some are inspiring, some are lyrical, fun and upbeat... But all are just beautifully pleasing to the ear (and the heart). Clay Aiken... you sure deliver!"
2,"This is one of those items that you keep loving - year after year. I've now had this set for 3 years, and I still haven't found any other set that would compare. It took me a long time to decide, and I'm glad this was my choice.......I liked it right off from the first time I saw it, and it handles wonderfully in the dishwasher as well."
2,"THIS CD IS VERY ENJOYABLE. CLAY AIKEN IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR COMPARED TO ALL THE GARBAGE PLAYING ON THE RADIO THESE DAYS. CLAY DOESN'T NEED VULGARITY,VIOLENCE AND HALF-NAKED, SLUTTY WOMEN TO SELL HIS MUSIC. HE HAS NATURAL, BORN-WITH TALENT THAT NO ONE CAN TOP! THANK-YOU CLAY FOR YOUR WONDERFUL VOICE AND ROLE-MODEL ATTRIBUTES! YOU ARE A GIFT FROM HEAVEN!"
1,It was a very good description of life during anti-social time
2,Really cute sexy shoe but they do run small and they are very high as well but it said they were stilettos. I love them and I also look the red color.
1,"We bought this together with the Tonka Wheel Driver Scoot n' Scoop 3-in-1 ride-on. With an attachment that comes with the crane, you can turn the ride-on into a tow truck. Good idea but it doesn't work very well. My son can never keep things attached to the hook on the crane. And the crane is virtually useless by itself. Pictures always show the crane standing by itself but it won't stand alone. The child has to hold it up, while trying to operate the crane to pick things up. Its too much to do at one time. My children do play with it time to time, they pretend its a vacuum and push it around the floor."
1,"The one I was shipped was junk. It broke the first time I put 25 pounds on it. One of the straps that hangs past the ear tore right off. One of the pictures above shows a guy with two red Olympic plates on the thing. The red plates are 25 Kilos each, that's 110 pounds. Frankly, I wouldn't trust the hardware on this thing with that much weight. It broke in such a way that I can still use mine, and it'll be a good long while before I'm putting 110 pounds on one of these, so I'm going to keep using it. However, if I had it all to do over again I'd trade up for a better one."
1,"This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame."
2,"This compilation should actually be named as the above title as the album consists of 4 hits from Communards. All are gems. With the superb digitally remastered sound, this CD deserves 6 stars."
2,"This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service."
1,"I love pampers swaddlers, but these are less expensive for a reason. The Baby Dry line has the blue colored inner liner (gel?) which is not as absorbent as swaddlers. The first diaper we tried leaked after just about 1 hour of use. We sent the box back and bought the swaddlers again. Amazon made the return easy, and even set up the UPS pickup at our door, which was a plus."
2,"This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out."
2,"This book and ""Come the Spring"" are well written, but aren't as funny as her other books. I love her books because they make me laugh out loud, and, while Ransom was very well written, it didn't have the laughter in it that ""The Bride"" or ""The Secret"" did. Maybe next time..."
2,"I really liked this book,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people's perspectives at different periods of time. [END OF SPIOLER] I would reccomend this to anyone who likes books by Isaac Asimov or a story that takes place over a long time. ****"
1,"THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
1,UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?
2,"Yes, the arrangements are almost identical to the studio release. But in many cases the performances are superior. Vocals come through clearer; ideas are more obvious. It's a real testament to their musicianship/professionalism that the songs are so similar in demo and final form. Clearly, they are their own producers, rather than pretty faced fools who let others turn their songs into hits. Have some heart, pundits. They need the money. I read a long (and entertaining) interview where they described how much it cost to rent the orchestra for one day. It wiped out almost all the money they had. Yes, their own money. So if you wanna hear the second Apple Venus, quit yer yappin. This demo CD is for supporters and fans of musicians, rather than record companies."
1,A wonderful past pace for western lit. Molly Gloss give her readers plenty of time to enjoy the setting that she has detailed in this book.
1,poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
1,"It is almost impossible to get this printer to print without an out of paper error, jam, etc. Doesn't matter what kind of paper you use. Whether you put in one piece (still doesn't work), more then one ( takes entire stack) It always says out of paper when it's not. What a nightmare. I'm finally tossing this item. I will NEVER by an HP product again. There are hundreds of complaints about this problem and they won't take the printer back."
1,"The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that ""Ice Machine"" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it. The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version). The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora! (though I wouldn't buy the standard album without the extra tracks just for Tora!)."
2,"The movie arrived in super condition.I had seen this movie only once many many years ago and had searched for it but did not know the title. Then there it was was on AMC. Had to have it for my collection. Great acting, super plot and an even better ending."
2,"This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!"
1,"Biotutor is a rip off. I can tell you that Amazon.com keeps removing my post because the company that produces this piece of junk asks them to remove it. The truth is that the people who rate these product 5 stars are not actual users. I PROMISE YOU, when you use this product you would never rate this product 5 stars and you would be so disappointed with this software. It's a very cheap looking software, the pictures and labels in the software are horrible almost like they came of a test book from the early 20's. They should be selling this at a bargain store for $1.00, even charging that amount I'm not sure it's worth it.I'm not going to spend a lot of time typing something that might be deleted. But just to tell you plain and simple, this program is pure junk. A rip off."
1,"I don't understand why the editors needed to cut the best songs from the show. I also don't understand why the felt the need to change the camera angle EVERY FIVE SECONDS. This makes for a decent cd, watching the video is hazardous to your brain. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL."
1,"This ball is great when it's inflated, but it doesn't seem to stay that way for long. When I pump it up on a Monday, it's already soft by Tuesday and needs another pump to be usable for anything but bouncing around. I'm pretty disappointed with its performance but waited too long to start using it and therefore am unable to return it..."
1,"First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!"
1,"The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up. Simpletech's web site and tech support are a joke! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages. Save your money."
2,"If you are from the baby boomer generation, you can truly understand what made your parents, aunts, and uncles of this generation who they were. Since the events of September 11th and after reading this book, I have a finer appreciation of what heroes are truly made of. I have a better insight into who my parents were and why. I also understand why I am the way I am and what these qualities that were passed down, did for me in my life. It also makes you appreciate the cost of freedom and what the men and women of the military did and continue to do to protect our liberties. Something I think we took for granted before September 11th. Enlightening book."
1,"I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !"
1,"I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more ""light"" in both style and heart."
2,"One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment."
1,"The george carlin box set suffers from the same kind of malady other comedy cd reissues suffer from: some engineer decided since there were ""tracks"" on the tape and vinyl album there must be tracks on the cds. This means that the last five seconds of a routine are often faded out and that the next routine starts abruptly, jarring the listener. What made Class Clown, Fm/Am, or Occupation Foole in terms of flow from one routine to another is now just cut and paste tracks. Doesn't anyone listen to the product before it is released? I returned the George Carlin box set and will now have to be very careful when I play my tapes. The problem is this is just a sign that cds are not all they are cracked up to be..."
2,"Great read...Little Bid Horn battle and the US attempt at geocide with the Native American population in a short, fictional format."
1,I was so disappointed in this album after hearing Clay's beautiful voice on American Idol. It's like the producers were trying to force Clay into some pop mold. I kept listening waiting for Clay to really let one loose and belt out a song. Didn't happen. Maybe the next album Clay can be Clay.
2,"Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man"
1,"I agree with the review dated March 14, 1999. I'd also like to add that as of Chapter 2, I've found at least three misprints in the solutions manual. Normally, these types of mistakes are not that much of a problem. But this should be unacceptable for any decent technical writing, especially mathematics."
1,"was very upset that this DVD did not specify that you could not play it in the United States. Why was it on Amazon, USA. False Will not deal with this vendor ever again and will make sure my friends and colleagues are aware of it.."
2,I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
2,"I ordered this great little player as a birthday gift to myself. It's outstanding except for one problem - The firmware is the unit as shipped was buggy! In version 1.04.3, any interrupted transfer to the device causes it to malfunction!I looked up the Creative support forum and dozens of people reported the same problem, namely a complete lockup of the unit and subsequent inability to ""boot"" it...My first unit failed after about fifteen minutes of playing with it, loading files, etc. Needless to say, I was distressed. Turns out YOU MUST UPDATE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it recharged. Another point I must strongly emphasize is that YOU MUST ""EJECT"" THE DEVICE under Windows BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT.I'm happy to report that firmware version 1.05.1 is much better and that I have not ""crashed"" since updating to it. I'm really enjoying it!I love this product and would give it 5 stars were it not for the buggy firmware that shipped with it. Cheers!"
1,"This is the first book I have ever purchased on Amazon that I had to return. It seemed to have been written by a man, there was not one scene that did not include some type of phallus. I am a fan of Victorian tales and classic from writers like Jane Austin, this book seemed to be written by someone from modern times trying to speak with the syntax and semantics of Victorian times. I would not recommend this collection to anyone who likes sensual and sexual play between women. There were some scenes with incest and rape. I did not get very far in this book, about the first 5 stories, in an attempt to find something worth my time. I returned the book the very next day after receiving it in the mail.Take a look at it in a book store before you purchase it to varify my words."
2,"Flusser is the second best writer on clothes (Boyer is the best) and the most knowledgeable. This is a very good book, whose only shortcoming is a lack of information. The first sections are shorter than I would have liked them, and the subsequent sections, though fascinating reading, are of limited usefulness to anyone who is not a rich globetrotter.Still, there is a lot of great info in those shop descriptions, but you have to glean it all out. An index would have been welcome.All told: clothing is about taste, and Flusser's taste is the best in the world, bar none. He has more than earned his position as arbiter of men's dress."
2,"This set of stories is definitely among the best works of fiction ever to reach the printed page! The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly. The entire first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering the entire time ""how are the good guys going to win?"" and we find out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we care about the characters. The book also has Captain America's defining moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands. He walks up to the God-like Thanos. His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist towards him. Captain America stands there, defiance to the last. The look in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain America, even good role models, then buy this book!"
2,"I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about."
1,"This movie must have been made as a pilot for the series that followed. This would explain the lack of wit and social commentary as well as the toning down of the violence. This movie had a serious continuity problem. Nobody seems to have noticed that in the first two movies Robocop had a son, yet in the 3rd movie during the flashbacks he had a daughter. This was truly a bad sequel."
2,"One of the ""must haves"" if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. Hundreds, (thousands?) of listings with photos of some, descriptions of all, and date of manufacture for most. The book also contains estimated value ranges, and useful introductory information."
2,My husband and I have had a few issues with our little darling over filling her shorts. We wake up at 1 am to change her as she sleeps through the night. Now it's smooth sailing no leaks happy baby happy mom. Little saggy when she's crawling around.
2,"When I first listened to this album, I thought it was the best Oasis album there was, but as I kept listening, I figured out that this album was missing something. It didn't contain songs that stuck in my head that I wanted to keep listening to like (WTS)MG? and Definitely Maybe did have. It was dissapointing to see this album fade so quickly in the charts, but for their next album, hopefully their new producer will give them more of a new sound. All in all, it was a good album, but not great. Oasis could so much better, I think they got a little lazy and sloppy on this one. Hopefully, the new album will sound better and newer, and hopefully it will fare better in the charts."
2,"Good movie, bad dubbing. Please releast the origanl version. I took one star off becuse of the dubbing."
1,"This order was part of a major scam. I never received it and the ""seller"" emailed me to send him cash to a particular account so that he could ship the item. I blew up his email and contacted amazon to wipe the order. No money exchanged. Surprised this item showed up (6 years later) as an item I had purchased. Learned to be careful of the too good to be true offers on Amazon."
2,"I really was looking forward to the release of this CD and must say was a little disappointed the first time I listened to it. I liked Invisible and This is the Night because they were familiar but was hoping for other songs Clay sang on American Idol. However, after listening to the CD several times, I can't decide which song is my favorite. I listen to it over and over at work. The thing that I find incredible is that I never get tired of listening to it like I do my other CDs. It gets better every time I hear it."
1,"Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!"
2,"Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever, so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album. I always loved Corea with Farrell, because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe's flutes, sax, etc., like rain drops or storming. Nice soprano. And ELVIN JONES! I put this up up around the ""Joe Farrell Quartet"" album, and Buster William's bass is great, so much I don't miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland. A fresh sound, unparreled even now. It makes me want to see the Outback movie. The album cover is beautiful. Finally, the price is outstanding. Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way."
1,"Even though they don't leak, I hate the fact that the baby smells poop all the time. The diaper gets wet and then the baby and all his clothes smell terrible. Also I don't like them because they do not seem as natural on the baby's skin as the Huggies. Huggies are for sure a better option! I will never buy them again!"
2,"This movie was done by Hal Roach, who was also responsible for Laurel and Hardy. I thought it was pretty funny. If you liked Laurel and Hardy, you'll like this"
2,"This is an excellent album. The title track Smoke Rings is exceptional. It was the band's closing theme song. All the tracks have a uniqueness to them. Well worth having in your music collection. The track ""My Heart Tells Me"" has some very beautiful vocals by band-vocalist Eugenie Baird. It also contains one of the great songs from the 30's ""A Hundred Years From Today"" sung by Lee Wiley. Her voice and the band make such a great song even better. Take a magical trip back in time and purchase this great album!!!"
1,"I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed."
1,"You can buy these cheaper at the babiesareus store (with mail/email coupons) Product itself is good, I am a pampers brand mom."
2,"...meaning not too hot not too cold- mfg. knows what they're doing in the design... not the self-appointed ""critic geniuses"" spouting off left and right here.. Yes, put a coaster or lid atop your mug to retain even more heat if you need it warmer (will also lessen evaporation)...just common sense...lol! The diameter of the heated surface is apporoximately 3 and 7/16ths of an inch so it will accomodate a mug that's medium large in size(a little bigger than average)."
1,This is one of the worst Adam Sandler movies out there. This is a rental only and not worth buying.
1,"We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one. Recently, we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images. Called again and since it was over a year, they would not help us. AAAH..I will not buy again."
2,"Nineteen Eighty Four offers a harrowing glimpse into the totalitarian state. Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader)."
2,"The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments."
2,"This is a great shoe. My daughter seems to like it, so it must be comfortable. The extreme plus is that Stride Rite has moved from the buckle to velcro -- finally! Easy to put on and take off."
1,"These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore. the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!!"
1,"My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!"
1,"If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
2,"When I learned that they were redoing these books with new, tamed down illustrations (Google it and prepare to be saddened), I remembered how much I loved these, as a kid, a teen, and still today. I knew I had a 3 book box set somewhere, but after not being able to find it, I decided to find replacements online. After ordering, I discovered my old set, but having 2 lets me loan them out to others. These are the most fantastic horror story books for all ages, and the illustrations are truly unsettling. Prepare to be creeped out in the best way possible!"
1,"I love the music of this old Christmas piece, full of memories. I've listened to it on records and CDs for years, but I wanted the visual effect of the opera, which I have seen onstage, live. This is a film of the original production;,uesbut sadly, the 1955 TV production values are a disappointment. I expected black-and-white, but the total effect is so much inferior to, say, a 1955 motion-picture film. That said, the voices are splendid!"
2,"I love to use this book as a quick visual reference while working on shows. When helping a customer, or explaining something to an assistant at our shop, this book is the easiest way to do so. It is so great to have a book where I can flip to a certain date, and have pages full of pictures grouped together to show someone what exactly I am thinking of. We have to work at a fast pace, and this book saves me lots of valuable time."
2,"Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, ""Anno Dracula"" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks. If you liked Dracula and don't mind the occasional ""What If"" scenario then you might want grab a copy of this hard to find gem."
2,"This is the 2nd flash card reader I have purchased. My operating system is Windows 98se, As you may have read in many areas the problems with USB compatibility.. I had a previous product that left me frustrated BIG TIME!! This is SO PAINLESS. You plug it in and follow the SIMPLE directions. I had this compact flash card reader set up and running with in minutes!!!I have used it for business daily and personal use also. IT IS A GODSEND. I have had ZERO PROBLEMS with this item. And a bonus is it will also read Smart Cards.I was surprised at the affordable price, ease of set up and in this day of HIGH TECH compatability issuse and patches I CAN SAY IT WORKS WELL AND WORTH THE LOW PRICE!!!Happy Pic taking.A Blond"
2,I love love love this rice cooker. It was finally time that I got a decent cooker. Don't bother buying a cheap rice cooker. It is a waste of money and they really can't compare to using a machine like this.
2,"...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!"
2,"4 stars for now, haven't used it, as it is a gift for my uncle. Packaging was nice, shipped on time, and no damage from what I can see. Will update review once my uncle uses it."
2,I wish I could just rate the book w/out writing a review! I'm not an author. I don't have a way with words!
2,"Born in Santo Domingo, Oscar de la Renta left his home country while still a teenager. His destination? Madrid to study painting.Today, there are few who are not familiar with the name Oscar de la Renta. He is a fashion designer known throughout the world not only for his couture collections but also for his philanthropic endeavors.Since beginning his own company in 1965 de la Renta has impacted the design of accessories, jewelry, handbags, scarves, shoes, furniture, and fragrances.Oscar, his initial perfume offering was introduced in 1977, and now is a popular seller throughout the world. In addition, it is the winner of the 1991 Fragrance Foundation Success Award.More importantly to us, the scent is unforgettable. Floral with a hint of Oriental it is a lovely blend of jasmine, basil, lavender, and sandalwood.It's romantic,and memorable. Enjoy."
1,"I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket. Thanks all for the warning. Bill Blass, Hmmmmmmm, I thought they made quality merchandize. Live and learn."
1,"Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"
2,"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."
2,"The quality of this handy bible is actually pretty good, although I only use it for travel. I would not recommend it as your everyday reader or research Bilbe. The pages are very thin, and not as bright as a quality Bible such as that produced by Oxford Press. The font is very readable and it's turning out to be a fantastic travel companion."
2,"I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already. I knew the movie before buying it, liked it, which is why I bought it.This review is to let folks know about the Special Edition. For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad. I mean, he's mad, but I always thoughtmad was supposed to mean crazy. He's not all that crazy. Makes for great alliteration though."
2,"I only tried a few test cuts, but upon examination of the tool, it's definitely a good quality cutter and you can't go wrong with these. The only drawback is it's slightly smaller than the typical 9.5"" cutters sold by Channellock or Greenlee so I would imagine you won't get as much leverage using this 1 inch shorter cutter. I also tried the Channellocks though and really can't tell much difference with cutting (my test cuts were on 14-3 romex) between the two brands. However, the smaller size can also be an advantage because it's lighter and smaller so takes up less space in your toolbox."
1,What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. If you want a really good book read Into thin Air or Seven Summits.
2,I've been using this product for a few years now and cannot imagine ever being without it. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and the difference after applying this product is remarkable. I HIGHLY recommend it.
2,"Despite being released at the turn of the 90's, 'Accelerator' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either 'FSOL' or 'LifeForms', and if they are remembered for anything it will be 'Papua New Guinea', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic. In 1992, it seemed as if intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate an irreversible shift in musical culture, and although FSOL didn't leave much of a legacy, this makes Basement Jaxx doubly pitiable."
1,5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
2,What can I say about this show except it is a good example of what a classic series is all about. Any John Ritter fan has to add this to their collection. I intend to purchase the entire series.
2,Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the great films that I recall from childhood. Robert Zemeicks made a film that everyone can enjoy. Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of sexual innuedno in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villian in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times sake.
1,"Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up."
2,"The Greatest Generation is a fabulous piece of work which transports the reader back to the 1940s and then goes on to show how it's survivors went on to influence our world. Upon completion of the book I began to think, how will my generation affect the world?"
1,Was hoping pamers would be more quality then the huggies that we normally use. But these diapers are total disappointment for us. We never want to use them for our baby at nights which leaks up and wets his bed.
1,"I ordered these tights, mainly for the price and the well-known brand. I am 5'5'' and about 130 pounds... average woman's height and weight and ordered a medium. They are very long - probably about 2-3 extra inches, which bag up at the ankles. The fit is also quite old-fashioned; high waist-ed. I would buy these if fit and looks are not all that important to you. I also run in colder weather, about 20 degrees in the winter and found they had very little insulation, if any.Overall, I was not pleased with the tight and would have sent them back, if there was not an additional $9 return fee from Roadrunner Sports!"
2,"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious. This book is a must read for all, old and young, female and male."
1,"This printer fails as a printer mainly because paper won't properly feed. HP helpdesk requests you to tap all paper, and put in 10~25 sheets only. This doesn't work. Feeding one sheet at a time manually has at best a 1/10 shot of success. Let's hope HP's refurb replacement printer is better."
1,"In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person. WRONG! Instead he comes off as a psychopathic obsessive fool who ruined the best thing in his life when he destroyed his relationship with the wonderful TINA. He also jumps back and forth with his opinion on TINA but hey who cares? We must remember that HE BEAT HER UP and like the old saying goes ""A leopard cannot change its spots"" or to quote Marlo Thomas on ""Friends"" ""once a cheater always a cheater"" Take that, Ike."
2,I use it and recommend it to many of my fellow students that are wading their way through college. Especially great for any international folk...the English language is a crazy beast.
2,"I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to ""bog-down"" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite."
2,"Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos. And the movie in 3D is awesome, I just bought a LG 47LW6500 and a 3D BD player...what else can I say"
2,"Don't listen to the other reviews. 1) Sam Gopal does not 'pound the drums', he is a highly skilled tabla player from India. 2) This was not a hastily conceived novelty act, but a follow on to the prior Sam Gopal's Dream. What you will find are 11 great tracks of heavy moody psych with an eastern slant. Other memebers included Lemmy later of Hawkwind and Motorhead and Andy Clark later of Clark-Hutchinson (and currently working with Gopal again)."
1,"Gentlemen miss this movie. As a married man I am consigned to the fact that I must watch certain movies that are geared towards the ladies, I am okay with that. Having suffered through most of said type of movies, I can say that this particular movie is a truly a painful experience without any humor to help. All this movie does is follow a sad and lonely woman around Italy and waste the two hours that is the movie running time. Do not buy this movie for the lady in your life because then you will be forced to watch it."
2,"If you have ever lived in a small rural town you will certainly be able to relate to and appreciate Jack Polidoro's latest novel, RETURN TO RABY. If you have not had this living experience, Polidoro's novel will enlighten you as to just what you have been missing! Polidoro's novel is based on the reality of a small New Hampshire town that comes alive page after page and truly shows how rural life can be. Having lived in a ""Raby""like town myself, I could relate to the story first hand. I passed the book on to friends who have never been out of the city and the book was equally enjoyable to them! This story will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. You will be left will a warm feeling and a positive outlook on life. This is truly a wonderful story!"
2,"My little brother got this for his birthday and we played with it on Christmas (his bday is in October) and this thing guesses the most abstract things! We tried everything we could to stump it but we couldn't. It guessed fermeldahyde, sphincter, corpse, you name it, it guessed it. This thing really breaks the ice and livens things up. It's an amazingly fun game, you will never regret buying it that's for sure!"
1,"This was very gory. I got it for my husband, as he is an avid snowmobile rider. After watching part of this... I don't know if I'll ever let him go to the mountains with his buddies, without supervision, anymore.... LOL"
1,Packaged poorly......two bottles of the cleaning supplies were busted open.I had to throw away the entire order due to the other contents being drenchedwith the other chemicals. Very dissatisfied!!
2,"My daughter watches this daily and loves it just as much every time. I enjoy it alot as well. If you have an Elmo fan in your world, this comes with the most recommendations!!!!!!!"
1,"I had to read this book for a project in reading class. This book was very hard to understand, especially in the scenes where her father beats her. The plot was adequate, but ther seemed to be little chapters that contributed to the plot of this book. The climax was not all that exciting for me, especially since my brother and sister have talked about it and read it. The descriptions of characters were little, partly because of the book's first person narroration. There are also some discrepancies in this book that left me asking too many questions at the end of the story. I enjoy books that leave me asking little or no questions at the end. It was also historical fiction, which is a popular genre to teach. I don't care for it"
1,"The first track is the only listenable song on this entire album. The rest of the songs are incredibly boring and show little effort. If you like to pass the time by staring at a blank wall, your attention span might be able to handle this. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,"Over the winter, i seem to gain alot of weight. As a high school quarterback, that is not acceptable. Last summer, i think i went from 160 to 150. That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing."
2,"This little book is so much fun. It was written in 1954 so half of the fun is looking at salaries and other data from that time. Huff points out with goofy pictures but sound logic how you can be hoodwinked by the use and abuse of ""averages"" and a number of other ways that statistics are quoted. I use it to make sure that in my work I'm not fooling myself or misinterpreting numbers and charts."
1,"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
2,"I have used Pampers Baby Dry on my son for several months now and have been very pleased. For reference, my son is in the 90th percentile for height and weight for his age. These Pampers fit him well and we have had no leaks, though this may not be the case for a baby with a different build. In comparison, I have also tried:1. Huggies Pure & Natural, which shed lint all over my baby's bottom;2. Huggies Snug & Dry, which also shed lint in addition to leaking at night;3. Pampers Sensitive, which is also a great diaper that I used for his first few months. It is just more expensive and we no longer needed the ""sensitive"" option.Overall, Pampers Baby Dry are great. The only downside is that the tabs can sometimes rub the thighs. Pampers has remedied this by adding ""wings"" to the front sides to protect chubbier thighs from the plastic tabs. Additionally, with Amazon's Subscribe & Save, these diapers are very economical."
1,"I have been in an insatiable mood lately for new progressive rock music buying CDs on a daily basis. I have uncovered some superb new bands such as Riverside, Abigail's Ghost, Frost, Phideaux with the first two named bands being absolutely exceptional. I was encouraged by other reviews to try IQ and this album particularly as being an exceptional and representative example. I think what one reviewer said sums it all up. IQ have managed to be what they are because they simple outlasted everyone else. I was sorely disappointed with this album for its total lack of anything original and new. Musically its fine progressive rock but it is not original. Yes it is Genesis, come Marillion etc. but one thing it is not is anything like Seconds Out. Overall I found the album flat and uninspiring...sorry."
2,"The protector does its job at protecting the keys from contamination and possible liquid spills. However, like other reviewers noted, the protector makes the letters and numbers harder to read, but not impossible. Some of the other skins available have the letters on the cover itself for easier viewing. That would have been a good option for this protector as well to eliminate the problem with seeing the keys. I have a 17"" mac book pro and this skin fits the shape and size of all the keys better then a previous skin I had. I read the review that warned that this item does not fit the new 17"" models. My computer is new and the skin fits it very good. (perhaps we are talking about a different model) It feels good to the touch and if you have the ""light"" up key option, it does show up good through the protector. I have considered returning it but probably will not as I type without looking at the keys."
2,"The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock. On the one hand it offers you all you ever liked about Argento's flicks: beautiful images, a brilliant soundtrack (this time by Ennio Morricone), ingenious camera working, bloody killings and breathtaking locations. Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro..."
2,"God versus Satan, Good versus Evil. With a really really good cast, good special effects and an interesting story line"
2,I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down. Once I got my mug warmer I can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. Not blazingly hot but just under that. I've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.
1,"I picked up this book from my library because the cover looked interesting and the blurb looked interesting. The book consists more musings and less research and organization. The author begins to tell a story or talk about a myth or idea, and then jumps from topic to topic, and we never see the end of her train of thought.I stopped reading around Chapter 3, when the book turned to the ""taboo"" of being a redhead in the Elizabethan era without any mention of Queen Elizabeth being a redhead - not to mention that red hair during this time was actually quite fashionable."
2,"I am reading this book in my ...english class. This book has everything there is for a book to become a great book. This is probally one of the best books I have ever read.Some of the names are hard to pronounce, like Schyld Scheffing,but it becomes easier to read as the book goes on. My class and I have all enjoyed this book very much.I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone."
1,"This book, like most written and portraying Hurricane Katrina, leads the reader to the conclusion that New Orleans is the only area devastated thereby. For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again. If you want to read and look at a balanced book coverning Hurricane Katrina, this isn't it."
1,"A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents."
2,"What can you say about cables, either they work or they dont't. This cable funtioned as expected and the quality was good. A good deal at the price."
1,"I purchased these earrings for myself, and when they arrived I knew right away they did not look like blue topaz. They are a very pale blue, and look like aquamarine instead. Also, the posts are unusually wide, and are difficult, and somewhat painful, to insert in the ear if you're used to the more common thin posts."
1,"I was just hoping for it to keep my coffee somewhere close to hot for a while. My coffee, in a normal coffee mug, is barely warm after 10-15 minutes on this. Yeah, it's warmer than it would be without it but I still have to go warm it up with fresh coffee if I want to enjoy it. My expectations were low. I don't even like my coffee very hot. Did NOT expect this thing to let me down but it has. It keeps my coffee at about 5 seconds worth of microwaving."
2,"Not much to say--it's an inexpensive, effective charger for your car. Particularly useful for the Razr V3m's worthless battery life."
1,"I've been a huge GFK fan for years now and this is by far the biggest piece of crap i have ever wasted my money on. I would enjoy watching this CD smashed to pieces more than I would enjoy EVER listening to it again. Don't get me wrong, Supreme Clientele is one of my favs, but if Tical 0 doesn't just blow me away, I am giving up on the Wu for good."
2,This is a good book but it gets boring at times. If you like science fiction then you would like this book
2,My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money.
2,I love Felt! great band and I have all of their recordings. This one is probably my favorite in their whole catalogue. Dreamy Psychedelic and heartbreakingly beautiful in places. I will never get tired of this recording. Maurice Deebank is an incredible underrated guitarist and Lawrence is perfect at what he does. A truly great recording that the average listener will never understand. Genius!
1,"It is the worst book I have ever seen.I passed both CFA and AICPA and familarize with those materials. I still find it difficult to follow. Not clear explaination, contradiction among arguments and wrong answers for the sample questions.I am very disappointed."
2,"I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."
1,I listened to this C.D. a while back & I almost went deaf this cd is awful this chick can not sing & this album is so freaky & scary!I could barely get through this whole cd! If I could give it zero stars I would! I have never heard of her kind of music it's like she has her own music catergory!If your into freaky & different stuff then you probably will like it! all songs have a outer space sound with weird noises!I don't know what I can recommend to you if you like this except anything Bjork!
2,"I have used the Meguiar's quik detailer and cleaner wax for years - both work well. I recently used some of the ""Hot Rims"" all wheel cleaner and it too worked well. Never have used the quik interior or soft wash, but I will now that I have the kit.If you price these FULL SIZE (not sample size) items individually you will what a value this set is at $20-22. Throw in the sponge, wax applicator pad, and microfiber cloth you have a super deal."
1,"This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
1,I never ordered this book so I can't possibly review it. I'm at a loss to understand how I'm connected to this title since I have never used the Kindle.
1,"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
1,Wish I had read the reviews first. I had no idea how bad the sound quality was before I bought this.
2,"I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."
1,"this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
1,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
1,"I was excited to find a Christian-based sitcom to enjoy with my children. We watched them. They definitely were Christian based, but they were annoying. These are definitely not role models for my girls. I would not want my girls acting like them. The one is so loud and flighty. They both seem really into themselves and very superficial. I would love for more Christian sitcoms to become available, but this one did not make the cut for me. I'm disappointed. I had such high hopes."
2,"It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country."
1,"While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
2,"This isn't a required prerequisite to ""The Dark Knight (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray],"" but it is useful in the progression. I bought the movie specifically to add content to my Blu Ray collection. If you're into the Batman series its worth the money for high def, if not wait for ""The Dark Knight."""
2,"I loved this movie! I was a little worried about Jennifer Love playing her and whether she would do alright, but she was great! She did wonderful portraying Audrey Hepburn and I forgot I was watching Jennifer Love Hewitt! See this then buy it! Definately!"
2,"We got our PowerBook in July of 2003 and had to replace the Apple adapter twice. I finally got fed up with the flimsy cord and purchased this Macally PS-AC4 adapter and I am very happy with the quality of the product. We've been using this for months and the only complaint (which is why the 4 stars and not 5) is that we miss seeing the little light around the end of the cord that plugs into the PowerBook that indicates the charge status (the one that glows orange or green). I would highly recommend this replacement to anyone, as long as you can live without the status light. At this price, it is hands down a better alternative to the delivered cord."
1,"This book was horrible. I've read many books on Titanic, and this has to be the worst. If you want to read a good book, check outA Night to Rememberor getTitanic: An Illustrated HistoryHalf of this book deals with the finding of the ship in '85. I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic."
2,This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.
1,"ALL THE SHOWS ARE CUT NOT LESS THAN 15 MINUTES EACH. THIS IS A RIP OFF. WATCH IT ON YOU TUBE THOSE ARE REAL LONG ONES, THIS XENON PICTURES DVD SUCKS!."
2,"An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book."
1,"The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library ""Prepared by HP"". It is ""an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages."" My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99."
1,I thought it would be fun to bring along some movies set in Hawaii on our family trip. What a disappointment when we missed half the movie bc the item sent was so substandard.
2,"I read the review on this book in People Magazine and finished it in three days. It was a very well researched book and a real tribute to the Author's family. The whole family has a gifting in the written word, Tink, Robin, & Julie. The book was an easy read. I recommend you check it out."
2,"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""! Unlike that book, these stories are original (and not sad).My favorite story is ""The Hook"", because I enjoy scary stories about serial killers, and this one, like ""High Beams"", can happen, which makes it HORRIFYING!"
2,Men's Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. It was easy to read on the kindle fire also.
1,"In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
1,"Honestly, if you knew about the blu-ray format and the capacity 1 disc has you should be appalled that there isn't the entire peanuts collection on 1 disc. This is such a obvious marketing plot to extort more money out of the consumer. If you buy this disc you are only feeding into that disgraceful behavior. If you don't know, blu-rays can hold more than 10 times the amount of content a DVD can hold. The entire peanuts movie collection can fit on to one blu-ray disc and to seperate them over 10+ discs just takes more money from you to send their fat kids to college. A pox on both your houses."
2,"I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!"
1,"These diapers are great for pee (never leaks), but terrible for poop (frequently leaks). We've been using these for the past 2 months (my daughter is now 4 .5 months, average size). She is breastfed so her poop is really runny. Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."
2,"and one of the most distinctive and beautiful albums in the history of rock music.i won't even attempt to describe this album, other than that if you're at all turned off by the screaming - don't worry. something about this cd voids that screaming down to just music. it's more ""shouting"" rather than screaming, if you know what i mean...it's just an incredibly beautiful cd, but it is the epitome of the ""let it sink in"" album.you most likely will not like this album the first time you hear it, almsot definitely if you're already in no way familiar with them, but it will sink in. it isn't silly, this is emotional music. it's beautiful and deep music. it's art in a very unpretentious honest way. just get it.~ will"
2,"A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of ""small town Latin America"". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His ""Novel Prize"" in literature was well deserved."
1,"MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."
2,"I think the Spicy Dragon is very good, although not that spicy, if you want something a little more spicy try the Wasabi with green tea noodles. This has been the only msg free and vegetarian ramen that I have been able to purchase in my local stores and now none of them carry it any longer. Thank god for the internet."
2,"So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back."
2,"These are my go-to shoes for audition pumps; I'm on my third pair. I wear an 8.5 and buy true-to-size (black leather, not patent leather), and although it's true that they're a bit uncomfortable in the beginning around the toes (although my foot is a bit wider), they break in beautifully, being leather, and they've survived auditioning and interviewing in NYC, Chicago, Texas, Atlanta, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Indiana...they're pretty good shoes. Basic leather pumps but sexy enough to wear with a lovely little black dress. I wish Jessica Simpson would keep making these as a permanent stock item!"
1,"I have never seen such a lousy printing. Indeed, we received our copy on 31 January 2012--and saw that it had been printed on 27 January 2012. It is impossible to read. The print size is worthy of an opthamologist's chart to determine just how small a size print it is possible for the human eye to read. I do not know how Amazon can even think of selling such a copy of what is a great book. I purchased the book as a gift--I am ashamed to present it."
1,"Whoa!! A flying robocop with the strings attached and all. No way man, this one bombs. And where's Peter Weller? The dude IS Robocop!!! Cheesy movies I can handle, but this one's going moldy. Time for Robocop III to catch a wave. See yah!"
2,This is a great device! It's worth every dollar and I strongly recommend it! I paid $36 for it on Amazon instead $60 from Tivo. The set up was easy. Just follow the 3 step instruction that came with the product and voila!
1,"This book is a strange mix of some sound nutritional advice mixed in with a load of pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo.As with most pseudo scientific works, it makes sweeping assertions without bothering to offer any backup.If you are not well versed in either science or nutrition, it's likely that you won't be able to distinguish the good advice from the waffleIf you know even a little about science, you'll probably get quickly irritated with all the gibberish in this bookIf this is supposed to be a book about good diet, then why the authors take such an anti-vegetarianism hard line is difficult to fathom.It's virtually an established fact that vegetarian diets and low meat consumption diets are far healthier than the average Western diet.When it's so apparent that the authors are clueless about science, I guess you can't expect any better.My advice is to give this book a miss and read a good book about nutrition.I'd recommend Patrick Holford's Optimum Nutrition Bible."
2,"Thank you, Clay Aiken, and it's about time. Your voice is a rhapsody in a world of tone-deaf producers. Every song in ""Measure of a Man"" has a wonderful touch of newness. The sound is fantastic. My personal favorites are ""I Will Carry You,"" a musical accomplishment spiked with Clay's soft tone, ""I Survived You,"" a blend of complex words and a nifty tune, ""When You Say You Love Me,"" a catchy, bouncy melody, and ""Invisible,"" a yearning yet upbeat piece that constantly runs in my head. I am very happy with this buy, excited about the next, and maybe someday hearing Mr. Clay Aiken record his wonderful range and style with a full orchestra background."
2,"This is an absolutely fabulous CD. There music is fun and diverse. The lyrics are great and meaningful. The rhythms are wonderful and energetic. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Bachata or wants to get to know the music. I loved all the songs from Confesiones. My favorites are: Te Quiero Igual Que Ayer, Polos Opuestos, No Regresare, Cuando no se puede olvidar......It'll make you want to dance all night!!!"
1,If you like auto-biographies of egomaniacs that have lived a lewd and lacivious life. Go ahead and read it. I didn't like it. I could put zero stars but amazon wouldn't let me.
1,"I bought these in August for my Father and he loved them. Upon visiting him this Christmas (4 months later), I discovered that he had stopped wearing them. The bottom had ripped away from the waist band and a button came off. The pajamas are of course now useless. Went to order someone new ones, and of course these came up on the search. Don't buy this inferior quality for this much money! Not a good deal"
1,"The product itself is great, but it came in a plain brown box that didn't even fit the telescope and with part of it sticking out of the box. There were no instructions and no star chart. After 3 months of dealing with this company and filing a complaint with Amazon I am still having trouble with them. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and today will file another complaint with Amazon. I would never order from this company again."
2,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
2,"I have had two Ionic Breezes to help with family allergies for over a year and for the most part they work great. One stopped working and they sent a new one without my having to send back the broken one first! My complaint is that I have to clean the one in the living room at least weekly, rather than monthly as the company says. This may be because I live in New York City and keep the windows open, bringing in lots of dust. And I have a cat. Clean up is pretty simple and fast. The machine is indeed silent, it removes lots of dust and is inconspicuous. I think it improves the air quality quite a bit, of course, more when the windows are closed. It has helped a LOT with our allergies."
2,"I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time, this book required my full attention."
1,"This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!"
2,"The Bad Boys of Hollywood as you have never seen them before.This special breed lit up the screen with blockbuster films and their private lives did not pale in comparison.A gossip gourmets delight!Newly discover footage that will spotlight these lovable rogues as they lived out our fantasies.Marlon, Brando, Errol Flynn, Robert Mitchum, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, James Dean, Sean Penn, Steve McQueen, John Bulusi are all here!"
1,"It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."
1,I've tried to get into this artist but I cannot. I would rather listen to 20 hours of someone's fingernails on a chalkboard than what passes for Bjork's voice. Avoid unless you like to hear your dog howl.
2,"This is a great tool for the N64. It combines two great components of the system. With four memory paks (492 notes!) and a rumble pak with two rumble settings, you can't go wrong. Save all of your games in rumble style! The only problem is that when you start games with the switch at the memory setting, usually says that your memory pak is damaged. But with a press of a button, you can repair it and your well on your way."
2,"I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size."
1,"PLEASE this is a warning! Do not buy this printer!!! Avoid at all costs!! HP tech support is useless and clueless. I had it for 3 days when it started jamming 100% of the time. PLUS, as a graphic designer I need my output to be tru to scale, this junk prints a 4 inch square as a 4.125 inch square! It does NOTHING good, plus it ran out of color ink after 40 pages!!I wish they had negative 5 stars"
2,This product is so awesome it keep my coffee warm. My office is always cold so my coffee gets cold really fast. I totally recommend this product.
1,"Pampers are actually an okay brand of diaper, however I put one on my daughter with sensitive skin (and eczema) and she immediately broke out in a rash in every area the diaper touched! I could not use the rest of the package and the rash took several days to go away. If your baby has sensitive skin at all, stay away from Pampers. Huggies work best."
1,"Or should I have said, should have been better. Clay Aiken was one of the perfomers from AI2 that I fell in love with. What happened to this new CD is anybody's guess. All I know it that this wasn't up to Clay standards and probably should not have been released so quickly. I liked Measure of a Man but that was about it and even it was lacking."
2,"I wanted a reliable second battery for my camera to take on an extended overseas vacation. I was concerned about ""OEM"" off-brands (which may be OK, but some reviewers advised caution). I was not disappointed by buying the Canon brand named battery which appears to function exactly as my original battery. The Amazon price was much better than I could find locally, and the delivery time was just a few short days after ordering."
2,"We tried Huggies when our son was born, and they just didn't cut it. Pampers have been consistently good to us, and we'll continue using them as long as diapers are necessary. I do kind of wish that there was some kind of deodorizing feature because my son fills these things up and starts to smell like pee!"
2,"This book gives an excellent and easy to read look at writing your college application essay. If you are just going to read a book and not do the exercises, this is a great choice - it doesn't have any exercises. Instead, the emphasis is on finding your own voice and telling your story. For example, he gives a list of the most overused, deadly topics and then shows how you can write a really good essay on one of the ""forbidden"" topics. He also includes a number of sample essays with comments from real college admissions officers - so you can see for yourself the difference between good, bad and mediocre."
1,"This novel was a huge disappointment. The idea--of mostly Latino women coming together to discuss the vicissitudes of life--is original, but the novel just sputters along. Part of the problem is that the dialogue is reduced to idle chatter and the narrator remains aloof and--do I dare say it--boring. The reader never gets a sense of how the advice of the Latino women influences her life in any deep way. The writing, also, is a disappointment: flat and uninspired."
1,"I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children, I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom, gloom, and more doom! After reading it, I thought that I would end up on bedrest early, that my twins would end up in NICU for months, and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems, but manage to stay positive. Incidentally, I never was put on bedrest, my girls were born at 36 weeks, they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me, from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences, this is much more common than this book would make you believe."
2,I received this air bed over two months ago and we love it. I bought it for my granddaughter to sleep on and it's the easiest thing to set up and take down to put away. I put a mattress pad on under the sheets and she says she would rather sleep on the air bed than her regular bed because it that comfortable. No leaks so far. I'm very happy with this purchase.
2,"This is the story of the prim and proper Susannah and the dark Latin former street kid turned FBI agent, Augustus (Gus) Rapheal. Susannah is madly in love with this dangerous brooding man. The problem? He had an unsuccessful love with her perfect sister, and still apparently carried the torch. However, he came to offer her a job to go undercover with him, and she agreed. Soon, the inevitable happened and they were running from danger and submitting to their passions. This is a sweet romance, and you really do like both characters. It doesn't have the snazziest of writing, and sometimes seems rather simple and slow, but the romance was a very effecting one. The danger and intrigue was not bad as a backdrop and kept as a continual focus where some other romance novels may leave it as a weak side story that's often forgotten when the passion runs high. I recommend this book if you want a simple sweet romance and two likeable characters."
2,"As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture."
2,"I love this unit. Small, compact, versatile, and best of all... it makes flawless rice. I have tried jasmine, basamati, long grain brown and they all turn out perfect. And the steel-cut oats that I made for breakfast today were the best I have ever done at home.WELL WORTH THE PRICE..... what ever you pay."
2,"Whenever people criticize me for being a Cline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille & 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer. The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs. Give it a try!"
2,Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
2,"WuDDuP ya'll...Dis DuEcE_BiG aka BlaCC JiGaLo! Now jus cuz C-Murda from No Limit I aint buy this tha 1st day! But I got it bout a week ago...and I see dat C-Murda needz 2 be takin seriously!

2,"My old wireless adapter from Netgear stopped working on Friday evening. I ordered this Tivo wireless adapter by 6:30pm EST and chose Saturday delivery (Amazon Prime. Shipping was $6.99). At 10:00am on Saturday morning the UPS truck dropped it off at my front door. I was back in business by 10:15am. I just plugged in the adapter into the USB slot in back of my Tivo unit. I went to ""Settings"" on the Tivo menu and restarted the unit. Everything worked fine, it started updating my program guide immediately. When you are replacing a network adapter you do not have to re-enter your network settings nor the computers WPA/WEP security code. The settings were saved on the Tivo unit when I switched the adapters. Also be informed that this adapter connects via a USB cord that is about 3 feet long. It allows you to place the adapter in different areas and positions for the best signal. (The strength of signal is obtained in the Tivo ""Settings"" menu under ""phone/network"")."
2,This CD collection is an incredibly good bargain. The quality is superb and the selections were excellent as well. I am happy I ordered this.
2,"this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
2,"I have windows Vista to start with. Installation took all of 5 minutes. I installed the software that came with the product and could not get my PC to recognize the card installed in an empty PCI slot. Went to the manufactures website and sure enough, they had the new software upgrade for VISTA. Installed it and was online instantly. It seems as fast as direct cable hook up. Worth every penny. A great product..."
1,I read a lot of historical fiction. This is perhaps the third novel in the last 10 years that I could not finish because it was so slow. I forced myself to 250 or 270 pages but the story drags on.Its simply boring.
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
2,"This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. My friend, whose birthday present it was, was enchanted, and used it for meditation, excercise, and to create a peaceful ambience for writing. The vocals are evocative and ethereal without being repetitive or simplistic. I would recommend."
2,"This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking."
2,"This album is an excellent ""POP"" album - EVERY song on this album has a great melody. You will not have to hit the skip button on your cd player. Of course you will have your faves - My faves are Perfect Day and Touch. Another thing that makes Measure of a Man special is the fact that Clay just doesn't sing the songs - he puts ""FEELING"" into it. I loved the little surprises that I heard through out the album. For example the song ""When you say you Love me "" has a country feel to it.All I can say is buy the album - you will NOT be disapointed!"
2,Just picked up this CD - it is wonderful. The selections are ones I will love to listen to over and over and I am so impressed with the quality of musicianship. I hope to hear more from her soon!
2,"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever."
2,I went crazy in the theater watching this movie. Would highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Batman.
2,"I bought this for Christmas. It was somewhat challanging to put together properly, but after that it was quite fun for my five year old. I know when she plays with this due to the sound fx."
2,I'm replacing the exact same dealiwhop that started to stick / not turn off after several years of use. Install was easy.
2,"i'm surprised more people haven't discovered this beautiful little movie. hopefully they will soon. so charming, so unpretentious, so authentic. even if you've never gotten a haircut, you will love it."
1,"Good start. But, sort of slumps downward and never comes back.Might be ok as a reference."
1,"Stop listening to her music years ago. How do you explain this person who only comes out to the public when she is promoting a record. Money $$$$$$$ is her only satisfaction that and puting down the United States to anyone stupid enough to listen. Barbie, go join Jane Fonda on your hate tours."
1,"I started to read ""The Greatest Generation"" in the hope that it would contribute to World War II history. I really cannot say it did. I also found it to be repetitive. I also challenge the notion of the World War II generation being the ""greatest generation"" because of the patriotism it displayed. We have had individuals display similar patriotism throughout our history, especially since World War II. A recent example is Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal Safety who give up millions to join the Army Rangers and gave his life in Afghanistan. I also find it interesting that Mr Brokaw admires the World War II generation for its patriotism yet objected to his fellow journalists wearing the American flag."
2,"I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it. She experienced some difficulty at first downloading her music, but this problem has been resolved.The player is very easy to use - she did not even need to read the manual."
2,"Unbelievable singing and acting, Simionato is more than perfect, just breathtaking. After you listen her you will understand what I mean. There are no words to describe it. Much much better than any other recording of Cavalleria sung by her or any other. She is the star. The rest of the cast sings and acts correctly. Very good black and white video and sound quality. Much much better than expected. A Must. You will not find a better Cavalleria on DVD."
2,"Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!"
2,This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
2,"This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!"
2,"Fates Warning continues to push the envelope. They blend melodic riffs with bone crushing symmetry for that just right mix. This albulm is miles ahead of shades....If you like Dream Theater or Queensryche, this is a must for your collection...Its your Fate......."
2,"After reading ""The Time Machine"" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything ""upsetting"" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."
2,This is a beautifully written book that helps us to understand how what we say & do affects other peoples life's both at the work place and in our daily life. Dianna uses real life examples that show just how taking the time for a kind word or deed can make a difference in showing God's love to others. I highly recommend that corporations have all of their employees read this book.
1,"Are you seriously trying to tell me that this is a baby? A 15 year old wouldnt even wear that slutty clothes. Nor would a 20 or 30 year old! Do you seriosly want your kids to have this toy, and start to dress just like the ""baby?"" If you do, then go ahead, waste your money and your kids life. Plus these are the most discusting and ugly looking toys i have ever seen. Someone really needs to sue the desinger of Bratz."
1,"The first few Transformers movies had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. And still I actually managed to sit all the way through them. I got about 45 minutes into this one and couldn't go on. Awful."
1,"Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly."
1,I asked my friend why the Crowes couln't come up with any good songs. He said it was because they were bad songwriters.
2,"Gatchaman is the latest incarnation of what most people knew as G-Force. The characters are nearly identical to their 70's G-Force counterparts with a 90's look. The macha designs are excellent, the action is fast paced. The only problem is that the American voice actors didn't do justice to what was happening on the screen. I've only viewed volume 1, but so far it looks to be a great trip!"
2,"I would suggest a wired connection (especially for HD boxes) but if you must do the wireless, this is your best bet."
1,"I already know that I will love the movie. The problem is, shpping is and always has been a deceit. Even f you pay for next day (Prime Member), you will not get it on time. There is no other solution for law-abiding people."
1,"I do not know what all of the fuss is about this book. Every single page I read was an absolute yawn. I did not care what happened to any if the characters and I just did not care about any theme this book attempted to convey. For me, I got not one thing useful from reading this book. And I can usually find a little bit of a gem in everything I read. So not interested in reading Grapes of Wrath. Oh well, can't win 'em all!"
1,"all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?"
2,"I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new book to read. When I found my mom's old tattered copy of Clan of the Cave Bears, I didn't expect much. Oh my goodness, though, Auel is a virtuoso. I cannot wait for the next one!"
2,Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ..... . . . . .. . . .
2,"I'm not any sort of expert of musicals but all I know is I really enjoyed this when it came out and years later I still find myself whistling Evita songs every other day. It is memorable music and this movie/soundtrack is done in a very entertaining way regardless of how faithful it is to the original. The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music. Plus unlike many soundtracks that skip songs this one is literally THE sound track to the musical. I pushed play on the CD once while the DVD was playing and it was synchronized."
1,"Other reviews state this item is very quiet. Mine makes a very loud grinding noise. If the windows were open, I think the neighbors would hear it. The noise is totally distracting, thus I cannot use this product. If it was quiet as stated by others, I think I might be very satisfied with it. Did I get a ""lemon?"""
2,"This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."
1,This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
1,This movie is awful. Not exactly sure why Nintendo ever allowed this to be released. Has nothing to do with the game.
1,"I was very disappointed in this book. I like the author and bought the book with very high expectations which were not met. I did find that the book is an older one with a spruced up cover, however, being that the book is a period piece, I didn't mind that much. However, I COULD NOT get past the heroine. Maddie was a hateful, spiteful, vindictive sort and I lost all respect for the hero because he seemed to love that about her."
1,"Sheena Easton is a terrible mistake in the history of the music industry. How did this woman ever get signed? Don't buy this CD, it's gross. 80s pop is a bad genre of music. This whole CD is a bad example of that bad genre.First of all, it's 15 songs. 15 songs is cool if the singer is good. But Sheena is BAD. This CD is 15 songs of torture and regret -- regret of ever putting the CD in your CD player. Her voice is weak. The songs are very upbeat and poppy, but with her voice, they sound weird. She's not good at pop. And she's even worse at ballads. She's just bad at everything. She's a total Madonna wannabe.Please, please, PLEASE don't purchase this CD. It's a waste of your money. Buy something good! NOT Sheena Easton!"
1,"I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
2,"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."
1,"Loved ""whats the story.."" so recently 4/05 got this CD. I cant believe its the same band. DM is boring and whiny and I can hardly listen to it all the way through. ""whats the story.."" is so much more inspired and less nasaly. Im glad I didnt hear it first or I never would have gotten the 2nd one. Music isnt that good either"
2,Teaches you really good and easy to understand and allows you to learn the asvab with no problem in order to pass with flying colors
1,You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.
2,"One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."
2,"this book opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. she showed rational method as to how many discoveries could have come about. riding a horse for the first time must have been a true sight, it is taken for granted by us today but can you inagine what it must have been like to wittnes this for the first time. i have read all her books several times and been just as awe struck by every one."
1,"In this mysterious, crazy,and exciting story, a young orphan girl befriends an old women and faces the consequences.The way the author uses literary devices to set the perfect mood makes this book so good you'll never want to put it down! Taking place in the 1600's tells alot about what it might of looked like.""I slowly gazedinto the coast, and to my suprise I saw hundreds of boats being docked.""This gives you a very good idea of what it looked like.""I've been for a breeze every morning, just thinking he might be coming up the river.""This is what Kit feals like when she is waiting for Nat to come.In this book the mood is very inportant. Literary devices are also very inportant."" The old women seamed to be very quiet , relinquish, and at ease."" This suspenceful , suprising, and exciting book sort of makes me start to think.""Maybe there are really witches?"
1,"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
2,Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd. Captain Nemo the prototype for the mad at mankind genius villain; bad yet sympathy-deserving.Actually challenging reading: many 50 science terms.
2,"This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!"
2,I read this book first at 11 years old. It has been one of my favorite books ever since. The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already.
1,1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything.
2,This device is easy to install. I brought both two of these from this seller and the price is better than Tivo's. The shipping was quick. I wanted this device for a long time but couldn't seems to justify paying what Tivo was charging. I was browsing amazon and seen the same exact device's price and jumped right on it. I LOVE IT!!!
1,"With Clay's over-the-top, bombastic vocal stylings and his elvish looks, the Pop Idol franchise plans to take over the world.Really people the album sucks, let's face it. And may I offer a suggestion: instead of buying 500 copies of A Ton of Crap, donate some of that money to some of Clay's favorite charities.And one more thing, if I was invisible, I'd burn every copy of A Ton of Crap and destroy all the master copies."
1,It does not work at all! Or if I used it wrong? Anyway I threw away the whole box. Waste of money.
2,After reading the four agreements this book makes it more effective and is very worthwhile. If you like the first this makes it better.
2,"This book by Peter Fiduccia is a good, basic primer for learning about deer hunting and a good buy at $16.95. I found it interesting and learned many good tips and strategies from it. Well worth reading and enjoyable."
2,"I'm an MT with 20+ years of experience and own most of the Stedman books, which are quite helpful. However, when I cannot find a term in Stedman's, this is the reference I reach for. I cannot tell you how many times this little gem has saved me from lengthy searches for a term. Grab yourself a copy, you won't regret it."
2,The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.
2,"This work is an exhaustive study of the Luftwaffe's inventory from 1931 - 1945. Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended."
1,doent cover goo at all to me very light coverage wont buy it again sorry to say good day.. bye
2,"I've been a Clay fan from the start. I can't help it, he's just got a voice that makes me go gooey. I got this cd when it came out. I can't say I love everything on it, but I like it all. ""Invisible"" is a catchy tune that gets stuck in your head, it's fun. ""The Way"" makes me fall in love with my husband all over again (see we're not all teeny boppers LOL). The music content on this cd is not something I'd be afraid to play in front of my 3 year old (who loves to repeat things!). I'd recommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear a fabulous voice, even if all the songs aren't the best."
2,I really like this movie Because it is funny. I think that this is one of the best movies ever.
2,A wonderful collection depicting Jennifer's unique talent from early on through her later years! It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Extremely glad I made this purchase!
2,"I went the store and i saw this movie on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the movie was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne.This is like the only movie i didnt see him do his fancy kicks.This movie is worth watching,but if u wanna see his kicks dont get this one."
2,"I bought a version of this cart (the 800) about 25 years ago and it had been flawless until the top handle finally broke. I did order a new handle from Remin, but decided to treat myself to a new one and give the old one to a friend. It had been all over the world, hauled lots of equipment and never let me down. I did replace the cords a couple of times over the years, but that's only because of age.I didn't use the extra set of wheels on the 800 very often and prefer the 600 is it's a lot lighter.I very highly recommend this product."
2,"Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover."
2,"It plugs into the wall, it charges the battery. What more can I say? My recommendation is keep track of the one that came with the camera so you don't have to spend the money on a second one."
2,A remake of the original with up to date techniques. A must for a begginer in the art of Classic Salmon Flies and to have for your library. It used to be the only one you could get on this subject for quiet awhile. Nice to see it back.
2,"I had great expectations of this CD. It has surpassed all expectations I could have ever imagined. I don't recall when I have ever heard a CD and absolutely LOVED EVERY SONG on it. I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken's and I knew he wouldn't let his fans down. If you don't buy another CD this year, make sure you don't miss out on this one. It is worth whatever you have to pay for it. FANTASTIC!!!!"
2,a fascinating and stimulating account that seems to put things into the proper perspective. Makes the myths all the more enjoyable.
1,Another iffy episode worth skipping. I wouldn't waste my time with this episode. All because there are some special moments for Clark and Lois doesn't make it worth 5 stars.
1,"Webster gives a lot of detail of the history of Marketing in this book. It includes all the recent develpments in Marketing and how it has affected the customer. For those interested in how Marketing focuses on the customer, this is a great way to understand the marketing of a particular product. That said, this fact packed book is about as dry as can be. If you read this book, you will see how the reader has to slog through this material. Lots of facts and theory, but little in the way of interesting the general public.One market for this book is to university students in Marketing. This book is a great summary of where Marketing will go in the future, and this could help the student. Few people would find this book interesting, other than sales people and Marketing."
2,"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!"
2,i loved it this is the best batman since batman its a movie i watched 5 times in a row and cant wait to buy it if you havent seen the new batman begins its a must see for all
2,"""Goodbye Earl"" was the single that opened my eyes for the Dixie Chicks. This single taken from their first album ""Wide Open Spaces"" is much more ""country"" than ""Earl"", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your ""troubles"" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.""Am I the Only One"" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of ""There's Your Trouble"" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is."
1,"My husband bought these by accident and I was glad to see them go. We normally use Pampers Swaddlers and Pampers Baby-Dry do not come close to comparing.While using these, my daughter had a few accidents (I will be fair and say that a couple of those could have been as a result of human error) and they do not appear to be nearly as durable.Unfortunately, I would not feel comfortable recommending these... spend the extra money and go for the Swaddlers."
1,"Okay all this book was about was random sex, the destruction of human nature, and the ending of all morales. However I must admit that Orwell had a prphetic sense when it camr to the idea of being watched constantly by the government. This book lacked a decent plot as well. THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED."
1,This CD is not the music but a Drama CD. It basically has skits from the anime on it.Karin
2,"This is a fun book. We first read it in the library and my kids loved it, so for Easter I put it in one of their easter baskets!"
1,"This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems..."
1,"I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."
2,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining."
1,"Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
2,"does not leak, lasts for a long time and prevents smell. this pack is the best value i have found. Love it!!"
2,"I would like to know if the balls can be purchased seperatly? I need to replace some of the balls that have been lost,destroyed,tossed away, or whatever. In a past review there was a recomdation to purchase extra balls, I would like to replace some, can you help me?"
2,"Cream/ Fresh Cream (DCC Gold Disk - 13 tracks): Fresh Cream is a great album. The original U.S. release, however, did not include the song ""Spoonful"", so my advice is to find a version of the album that at least includes that great song. The Gold disk has the 10 cuts from the U.S. release plus ""Spoonful"", ""Wrapping Paper"", and ""The Coffee Song"". As the Gold disk has become SO expensive recently, I would advise a different version of the CD but, as said before, make sure you get one with ""Spoonful"" (in truth, `Wrapping Paper"" and ""The Coffee Song"" are not that necessary to own)."
1,"The only song that's worth listening to on this album is ""Break in"" and it can be found on Superstar DJ Keoki's ""Transatlantic move"". Go for his album instead..."
2,I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product.
1,Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer. They will only send me a replacement but won't give me my money back. Not worth the risk. Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
1,"I read this book and OMG it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HATE IT WHEN GEORGE SHOOTS LENNIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!I would rate this book ages 12+.there are lots of cuss words like damn, hell and bitch!its too violent and inappropriate for you if you are young!(DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)(CAUTION If YOU DON'T LIKE SAD ENDINGS DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"
1,"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"
2,The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America ; and at a bargian price
1,"Worked ok on the piping i pre-assembled before getting under the house - slow but it workedThe heads like to slide and move around, which may be why heating is so uneven.Noticed that it took 60 - 120 seconds before the pipe would be hot enough.Several times it failed to heat the pipe enough to melt the solder once under the house.Waited 4 minutes before my arm fell asleep. The unit was noticeably cooler than it had been earlier in the day.Ended up with the torch by the end of the day.Great concept but cannot recommend this unit. Cost was about $10 per solder joint."
1,very easy overflow. it is not use friendly and have to clear outside very time you use it. Not good!
2,I prefer these diapers because the swaddlers had a mesh that stuck to my babies bottom. My only complaint is that they are a smaller fit. I will have to order a size 3 next time.
2,"they don't bother to make many wwi movies anymore, so i was excited to see this one. the script is admittedly not very good, and the performances were kind of lame but they did not have good dialogue to work with. despite this i still enjoyed watching the movie as the combat sequences were very very realistic and had wonderful sound. it is great to finally see combat the way it probably really happened and feel adrenalin pumping. i thought that one scene in the howard hughes movie with decaprio got this across, and this movie continues what that scene suggested. too bad whoever wrote the script was not very smart or this could have been a classic."
1,"Fast shipping, but none of the 10 discs I bought worked. I tried different speeds, burners, and ISO's. I tried to contact Amazon and also the seller but got no response. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,"This a the book everyone should have- from serious students of the stars, to consultants, to people who know nothing at all about astrology. It's brilliant, hilarious, and ORIGINAL. You won't find a lot of this information in any other astrology books and it is accurate-"
1,"God, another European power / melodic metal band !!! THis one had a good start, possessing Kai Hansen along their ranks. So I went for it !! What a deception!!! It's so repetitive, boring, dumb. If you like real metal, I can say these guy tried to do it, but failed miserably !!"
1,"When new, these were great, but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time, years in fact. Batteries this old cannot be charged up again. You're just buying a paperweight!"
2,A darker side of Amy. Probably written and recorded when her marriage was falling apart. Very insiteful.
1,This warmer doesn't even begin to keep coffee warm. Don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed given the Mr. Coffee brand...
2,"I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!Rita Southgate - Cyprus"
1,"I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies."
2,I Cant wait till christmas then i will get my advace pet i seen what it could do so i cant wait.hey does it come with a jack in cord so u could like jack in to ur computer and add stuff.If so that joint is cool right protoman (yep)!!! hheehehehe im 14 years old and i approve this toy to be the best.
2,I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!
2,Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!
2,"This album was quirky enough for me to pick up and love to listen to!How would I compare this....hmmmm....I would probably say she is more like Tracy Bonham than anything. But PowerPop? I wouldn't go that far. She is NOT Aqua (or is that quirky powerpop?) or the spice girls.This is rather laid back kind of music, good stuff. It's the kind of stuff you'd listen to in a coffee shop. Good music, and a wonderful singer. The guitars are very good in this album as well, and I am looking forward to another release.My favorite tracks on this album have to be ""You Are the One"", ""People In This World"" and ""Big Three Wheeler"". ""People in this World"" has to be one of the heavier songs, along with ""Flyer"".If you like Tracy Bonham....(if you even know who she is, she did that amazing song, ""Behind Every Good Woman""), you'll probably like this album as well."
1,"I received the package with missing main dress, belt and cloak (I received only the mask, gauntlets and shoes cover)I'm an oversea customer and it will be very costly for me to return this item as already I paid the shipment fees to get this item.I sent them an e-mail on 1/11/2013 requesting to send me the missing items , BUT, they didn't respond till now!!!"
1,"if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!"
1,"Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
1,"I am the radio communications broadcast fans, I want to reference or informations about this. If you dont pardon I want the books of reference news broadcaster Radio or TV"
1,"To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
2,"After racking my brains trying to read William Faulkner, I decided to give this short, simple, touching story a try. Steinbeck is a great author to read after Faulkner; his easiness of style cures the headache Faulkner's vortexes of plot development cause. This novel, which was written to read like a play, contains the memorable characters of George and Lennie. Lennie's phrase, ""Are we gonna have rabbits George?"" has been immortalized. This story is easy to read and enjoyable; however, one cannot help to sympathize with the loneliness of all its characters. I recommend this book, but I classify it in the ""Literature Light"" section of the books I've read."
2,This was a really great show. I hope they hurry up and release more seasons. They got better with every season and the final episode was awesome. I want to own the entire collection!!! Please release them soon.
2,"Everyone I encounter who knows who Bjork is either loves or hates her work...doesn't seem to be any middle ground. If you like only traditional pop, country or other genres and want all the songs on your albums to sound the same, stay away from Bjork.If, on the other hand, you get tired of songs that all sound the same and are looking for something fresh, you'll love Bjork. It seems she is trying something specifically unique on each track.I find 'Post' slightly more innovative and interesting than 'Debut', although both CDs are great. Of this bunch, my favs are, in order: Possibly Maybe, Isobel, Army of Me, Cover Me, Hyper Ballad and Enjoy, so the Amazon provided clips cover only half the good ones! The only track I didn't care for is It's Oh So Quiet.Get it and listen to someone who isn't afraid to experiment!"
2,I have wanted to study and understand the Old Testament more for a very long time. And a good book is hard to come by. This book brings the Old Testament to life and is great read! Studying the Old Testament now has a new meaning and dimensions.
2,"This easily qualifies for the ""Best Anime Award"" for the romantic Anime scene.Buy it and the soundtrack. You won't be disappointed.."
2,"Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!"
1,I went to see this in the theater and myself and two friends could not go the distance. We walked out before it was over. The plot is ridiculous and the acting does not make up for it.
1,"I went to hear Dr. Eby speak thirty years ago, and at the time I was quite impressed. I bought this book and quickly read it, and was deeply inspired.HOWEVER, I DO remember Dr. Eby quite confidently claim to say that Jesus told him that he would not die before Jesus returned. I remember how it struck me just like the promise that Simeon had about not dying before seeing the Messiah (which he did, when Jesus was presented in the Temple shortly after his birth.)This was not an isolated claim; he made it several times, including shortly before his death in 2002. On the basis of this FALSE claim (unless you believe that Jesus lied to him), I cannot recommend this book, no matter how ""inspiring"" it might be. Dr. Eby was a fraud, pure and simple, and a false prophet. To say otherwise is not to respect the facts."
2,"On the surface, this book offers startlingly beautiful language and heart-stopping imagery. But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art."
2,I was THRILLED to find this at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I LOVED this show growing up and now owning it and watching it again just makes me smile and brings back those memories. What a great show. We we always think of John Ritter fondly and miss him greatly.
2,"If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
1,"I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan."
2,"Lambasted on it's original release and despite significant flaws, Super Mario Bros. has maintained a longevity which has transcended it's original release, and now is a cult classic"
1,"This movie is absaloutley awful, the acting was so bad, it made me cringe in my seat. This is one example where they should have completely recasted. It was also upsetting when it decided that it wanted to be ""Lord of the Rings"" with all the screenshots and battles. I love the books, the Chronicles of Narnia are one of my favorite series, and the previous adaptation of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" I loved, but this strayed much too far from the book. The reason the four children slipped by with no acting ability in the first one was because their roles were not so serious. I mean, here they are killing other human beings without even flinching! Susan just whips out her bow and shoots trained soldiers off their horses with the nonchalance of getting out of bed! I tend to be very hard on movies. If you can sit through terrible unconvincing acting that makes Vin Diesels ""Fast and the Furious"" look like ""There Will be Blood"", than it's a mildly enjoyable time at the cinema."
1,"The pulley is plastic, not metal as pictured. I've added a photo to show the actual item that I received. The tensioner was made in Canada, according to the label on the box. The plastic pulley might be reliable, but I purchased this item based on the image showing a metal pulley."
2,"es una excelente obra , es el inicio de una saga muy interesante. a pesar de ser una novela , su sentido histrico es completo, su adaptacin al contexto tambien, de verdad la recomiendo, a todas aquellas personas que os guste leer novelas, obras y escritos entre otros, reales o ficticios relacionados del siglo XI al siglo XVI."
2,I love this product... until the price gopes up. This product costs $40.00 bought seprately at the store. Once the price goes up to $37-$38 i'm not saving anything.
1,"I couldn't warm up to the character of Tempe Brennan. Something false about her. There were too many coincidences to make the plot plausible. Connecting the murders she stumbled upon in North Carolina to the murders in Quebec was enough of a stretch, but then throwing her sister into the thick of things was one coincidence too many. The detailed forensics were interesting to an extent, but not interesting enough to make up for the story problems."
1,"I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
1,This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
1,"I bought this video while thinking to myself, ""hot chicks beating the crap out of each other, sweet"". Well, none of these things turned out to be the case. The chicks aren't hot, in fact one either used to be a man, or still is a man. The violence is limp to say the least. Imagine an episode of cops where neighbors at the trailer park are in a domestic disturbance. The problem is that the girls aren't athletes, nor do they seem to care much if they win. Stay away, this is just some dude with a camcorder attempting to get you to part with your money."
1,"Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap."
2,Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy.
2,"This was very entertaining and I enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed that more time was not spent in my own part of the country, Co. Durham."
2,"Uh oh -- I loved Cottage Style so I guess that makes me cutesy, according to the previous reviewer. I wrote one of the positive reviews earlier, because the book encouraged me to make this little place of mine the cottage I'd always dreamed of. Yes, my sofa is chintz, my walls are white-painted paneling, and lace curtains flutter at my windows, blown by the breezes off the ocean. If that's cute, than what's the problem?"
1,"It's hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. It is not kindle ready, although it is textually complete. Should be a freebie."
1,"My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. We got it for him and it was pretty frustrating. The parts kept falling off and the elevator has NEVER worked. For 2 days straight he played with it, broke every piece off practically, and came crying to mommy to every few minutes. That was 6 months ago. He pretty much hasn't played with it since. Too bad because he's such a batman freak.Maybe he was just too young for it. If you're buying it for a younger child...beware!"
1,"At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."
1,"If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or don't have good balance, don't get this! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place. You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time. I ended up using in on the carpeted floor, sitting on the couch and even then, it was difficult to file every angle of my heel. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good file on your feet."
1,"The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
1,"I want to buy this product, but I want it in Black.....Why should I allow you to choose the color when I'm paying."
2,"I don't understand why everyone else who wrote a review didn't like this book. It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good."
2,The bottom of my shoe had separated. Had heard about this product from other people. Tried it and the repair worked.
1,"I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
1,"I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money."
1,"This book is a joke! It covers different stories told supposedly by women in Exotic positions, such as strippers, prostitutes and porn stars. The stories are very well made up, at least the author has a creative mind. All it really talks about is the hundreds of lovers these women take on, nothing else."
1,"If you're interested in only buying this to listen to the interviews and comments of artists who were there, and finally getting to hear from Rosenman and Roberts, then by all means buy the DVD. But if you're buying it for the musical content you'll be very dissapointed. They edited a lot of the songs horribly and cut the life out of them."
2,"Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film."
1,"I am an avid fan of Clay, and in my opinion, this cd did not give justice to his talent. It was a big disapointment. The emotions and the magic were just not there. I hope RCA realizes that its the golden voice of Clay that gains admiration, and that they should not change Clay's style of singing, as his voice in this cd is just mediocre. I could not even believe that it was him who was singing..."
2,"I have been buying Hi-Tec for years. When I found the Altitude IV I fell in love instantly. This shoe fits great, has little break in time and still holds its sturdiness as it ages. Well recomended."
1,"I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clich-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."
1,I bought this from the same co. before christmas and was stunned that the price had doubled. On the page the price was not clear!
1,"This book is really a very simplified version of the Seth ideas written down by Jane Roberts in her many books. The Seth books are much more detailed and profound, but for our fast-food society, this book is for those who don't want to take the time to read the real thing."
2,"This is the best book I have ever read. I will read it again and again. Mrs. Speare writes so well. Read it to find out. I'm not really writing a review, just stating my opinion ;)"
2,"We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it."
2,This download is thorough in its progressive practices. You can change the practices according to ability of the players. It can be used for beginners and senior players. It all just makes sense! It encourages good touch on the ball and also game like drills.
1,"I usually like movies with war scenes but this one's just aWful, so awful it's embarrassing."
2,"This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"", which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"
2,I use this book almost every lesson for my Algebra classes.One of the best for extra practice.
2,"While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad."
1,"I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately."
1,"Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the ""Dream"" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average ""Joe"" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much ""practical"" information about ""The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop"". Definately a dream."
1,"Immortal and emperor are the only ones that should be here. Where is darkthrone? What about uh Mayhem?? Satyricon? Dimmu Borgir, please. They haven't done anything new. Other then the Immortal and emperor this is a bad list. I mean, Arcturus is good, but they have what one or two true black metal albums. Bring out the classics."
1,"Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
1,lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the book is choppy and doesn't grip you like some other books.if you have all the other everest books go ahead and get it but you'll enjoy 'high exposure by breashears and climb by anatoli b. much better
2,"This book is exceptional in its portrayal of the future. Yet, it is slow for the few chapters. If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!"
2,"This a great combo of cleaning/care products for my car. It was exactly what I was looking for. If you know what all these products are, then you will understand this is a great purchase. Everything included is really all that is needed for a perfectly clean car. The only thing missing is the bucket, water, and a good means of drying (I used one of those super absorbent towels rather than a chamois)."
1,"i strongly recommend that anyone who ever considered purchasing this cd, spend your 15 bucks at arbys, because this cd is garbage. i used to love clay aiken, i even voted for him, but his ego is too large for my liking. this cd honestly would only appeal to deaf people, merely because they wouldnt be able to hear it. i almost fell asleep listening to it, every song is the same. maybe clay should consider flipping patties."
1,"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."
2,"I recently added ""No Reason to Cry"" to my Clapton discography collection. It was the last Clapton commercial release I acquired. I can only ask myself how I let this gem slip through the cracks. I agree with most reviewers that ""461"" and ""Slowhand"" are better recordings. However, the disappointment listeners feel with this album is a testament to Clapton's brilliance. By any other artist, this recording would be getting far greater accolades. However, Clapton fans are used to over-the-top, superb recordings on a regular basis, rendering us spoiled. I submit that an ""average"" Clapton album is superior to many musician's best work. My favorite song on the album, written by EC, is ""Hello Old Friend."" Simple and beautiful."
1,"I have been taking astragalus supplements for a very long time. I dicided to give Gaia's liquid gel pill a try, hoping for better absorption. However, only after a couple of days of taking it, I developed a lot of hives all over my body. When I examed the pills, I saw that every pill was only half filled with liquid. This can be indications that the pills were very old that the liquid had been dried up and poor packaging. I stoped taking it and threw out the opened bottle. I kept the unopened one so I can send to a lab for testing later. Will NEVER buy any Gaia product again!"
1,This is not a good written book. It looks like that the information is gathered from various sources and put together without explaining the important details. It tells an overview of the struts but fails to explain how and why. Even the elements of struts-config.xml are not explained in thorough detail and how they are related to each other. I would not recommend this book.
2,"I found the information timeless. Yes, somethings sounded dated because of time. Yet it did not take away from the content."
1,"The thing is DVD is all about wide screen. Good movie, would have been MUCH better in the format is was made. This is a real bummer - stay away!!"
2,"This is the 2nd Kerouac book i've read (the first was ""Maggie Cassidy"") - and i found it enlightening and entertaining.It tells the story of a few young men and their lifestyle - that of a Dharma bum. The have very few possessions which they kepe is small shacks or in backpacks, and spend their time discovering nature and the dharma in this world.Kerouac's writing style varies - in certain parts it seems like pure fiction (describes parties, characters' interactions with family, etc.), at some points it seems very philisophical (i learned a bunch about Buddhism), and at some points it is just very descriptive (i live in NYC, and it made me miss nature.)There were a few parts that were ""wordy,"" but overall this book reads quickly and is very enjoyable."
1,"The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch."
1,"Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
2,"This is truly a very wonderful, helpful DVD. I bought it several months ago when it was still too cold to hoop outside. You do need quite a bit of space - probably a good 10x10 area would be enough. I went to a music festival with my hoop after practicing once a week or so for a couple months, and people were amazed that I had just begun hooping! Huge compliment, and a huge endorsement for this DVD.While this is an EXCELLENT way to begin hooping, I highly recommend going to a festival or a class where others are hooping - you will learn the most from watching others!"
2,"I really loved this book and the books that follow this one, but I didn't really like the way the people's feelings are. I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do. Though the parts that confused me were the mogur ceremony and the earthquakes. Because in a way it makes it seem as if all the magic is real."
1,"Recently my 2+ yr old hp printer died and I purchased the hp940c.Installing the software took approximately 1 day. After spending over 1hr (my nickel)on the phone with hp (no)support (due to system error msg's caused by the installation), I hung up and determined the cause of the error msg's. I also have a problem with paper jams due to what appears to be a design flaw. I suggest hp quit focusing on the compaq/hp merger and get back to designing reliable printers. If not, you might just call yourselves UNEMPLOYED!"
1,"After purchasing the first in this series of DVDs, I was eagerly awaiting the next one in the series. However I was disapointed in this vid. Their were less episodes on this disk than the first one and fewer extras. I will admit that the story is still excellent, although frustrating at times, and the animation is superb. ... I would rather buy the Robotech legacy DVD or even Fight Club instead of this vid.Sincerely:David C. Eberhart II"
2,it is a wonderful look at the traditions and history of goju ryu. A must for students of this art.
2,I love that I can get these older writings free for the Kindle. It makes a huge difference in our homeschooling budget.
1,"I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one"
1,Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
1,"Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read. His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point. I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter."
1,"I saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago. i said to her, this is real stupid, i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending. She said, ""we saw this movie already"" and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument, she claims WE saw it and i said, Vat ? i am getting alzheimers?Finally we figured it out. we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out.adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies. but this one really eats the bird!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1,"I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it."
1,"I am now taking calculus with this book. I don't know how people survived calculus with this book. This book is for someone who really has a grasp on calculus, not for beginners. The examples don't match the problems, so you're thoroughly confused and have nothing to look at to help you when you're doing homework. You get a headache literally just from trying to understand it. Calculus is hard enough and the authors make it harder to learn than it needs to be. I've had other calculus books that explain much better and have very thorough examples that I could understand and keep up with. This book does a very poor job."
2,"I bought this ofr my neice, but all of the kids had a great time with this from 6 to 16 years old. I knew the product and was delighted I didn't have to wait in line to purchase it, I just pushed one button, no waiting!!! Yeah!! Nothing like buying known name brands and finding them AVAILABLE and AFFORDABLE!! Thank Amazon!!!"
1,"I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right. And if you get motion sick easily...well, Taz pretty much spins a lot. Enough said!"
2,"I read books for ""escapism"" and for the pleasure of reading. I'm not a political or social scientist, so evaluating a work of fiction on that basis is meaningless to me.Simply put... It's a very good story that is both easy to read and hard to put down. I loved it."
1,"This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I don't have anything to add to the other five-star reviews apart from this: I too received this book in 1979 or 80. I recently dug it out and gave it to my six year old son and he LOVES it. Evidently the passage of time and the advent of video games and digital animation has not dimmed this title's appeal.
2,This adapter is perfect for my Series 2 DT Tivo box.Setup was effortless and now I can connect to my Tivo Box online. It's great!
2,"This MP3 player served me well for two years until (because of my clumsiness) I broke it. It worked beautifully, able to play both MP3 and WMA files with ease. Loading files onto the player was a breeze, as was initial setup of the software. The headphones that it comes with are comfortable and have a good amount of volume capability. A great MP3 player, I'm now trying to find a replacement but am finding it difficult to find another that measures up. I miss you, my iPAQ."
2,"I got this dress in red just three weeks ago to wear it at a christmas party and I got so many compliments on it. The dress is just gorgeous and the price is incredibly low. Very good quality and it fits perfectly. I ordered a size medium and it was just perfect. I took it out of the package, tried it on and fell in love with it. The red color is just stunning. I ordered it on a sunday night and it came in the mail on wednesday. Very fast delivery. I definitely recommend this dress."
2,"This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading. I have been trading for about 4yrs now. And only purchased the book because its a pre-requiste for CFT exams.I am amazed at how its has changed my prespectives towards trade managment.Again an absolute must if you want to commit funds trading in a relaxed & profitable manner.I am quite sure that the LORD, could have bestowed his Grace on Magee, and placed him in paradise because of it.GOD REST HIS SOUL."
2,"I first heard Depeche Mode when Violator came out and decided to buy previous albums. This one, by far, is one of the best! 101 is another great album. Strangelove, Little 15, I want you know are all awesome songs! I can hear any Depeche Mode song and go back to my high school years! I was totally in love with David!"
1,"Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it. ""WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS"" This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it. It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing. Basically, you can't skip the song if you wanted. Nice going Sansa, you made a piece of crap."
1,Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man...
2,"I noted the opinions of previous raters of this product and decided to give it a try.Not only was delivery fantastically quick, but the wireless card installed instantly and required no configuration by me! So nice to buy something that installs easily and works well."
1,"If you like your coffee at perfect drinking temperature -- DON'T BUY THIS. It's got a cord on it long enough to reach from one room to the next, but barely warms the cup at all. The base is also too small for most mugs."
1,"As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."
1,"hard to squeeze, hard to fill, hard to get more than a pinch of spice. there is a miniature hole to get salt and peppercorns in the units, they spill everywhere and don't hold much so you're always filling them. The handles are small and hard to hold. You have to squeeze them at least 30 times to get a decent amount of spice out."
1,"Make sure you view the sample first. Most of the characters particular to Spanish and linquistics show up as gibberish and on most pages the formatting seems to be lost. It is obvious that no one at the publisher even glanced at this to see if it worked when it was converted. Amazon can share responsibility. At the time of this review Kindle developers are still exclusively Anglo-centric. I hope they eventually see the value in adding some foreign language support (yes, Amazon, there are some people that read Spanish in the United States...)."
2,"This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!"
2,"I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. John Anderson is the real deal. This is what country sounds like without the glitter. Drawing from originals like Lefty Frizzell, Anderson's vocals are authentic; haunting on the sad songs. Great musicianship. I highly recommend it."
1,"I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that."
1,I absolutely loved the appearance of the bag. The colors are beautiful and the bag has a lot of compartments but it unfortunately has two huge problems:1. the main compartment opens on one side which makes it hard to open and close and calls for tugging at the zipper2. the material along the zipper to the main compartment tears too easilyI have had this diaper bag for no more than a month and the bag is already completely torn at the zipper. The great thing is that JJ Cole has great customer service. But I don't buy items to return them so this is an inconvenience.
1,"Our daughter is 22 months and we just got a box of Size 5 baby Dry diapers. We can't use these at nighttime and we have to check her diaper frequently. If she drinks a lot of water, the urine leaks right out of the diaper.My wife had me order another box of Huggies Snug & Dry Size 5 immediately. We'll try to use these ones up, but when we run errands or go to church, we will use the Huggies.I do not recommend these diapers at all. It's not worth the $0.03 difference per diaper from Huggies. I gave it a fair chance and learned my lesson."
2,"I did not expect much when purchasing pants online; however, Jos A Bank really delivered. The pants arrived very quickly and it was packaged very professionally. They really give care and attention to each product. The pants fit my son perfectly, and they are well worth the cost (very reasonable for the product). Jos A Bank has exceeded my expectations three-fold."
1,"Benji Franklin is a fascinating guy. He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a ""Mrs. Manners"" column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite ""truisms,"" Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher. If you're really interested in getting to know Ben Franklin, check out a scholar's biography--if anything, you get to learn all the juicy stuff about his disgustingly promiscuous sex life."
2,"I tend to order at the last minute ..... and Piper likes her food ...""right now"" .... thanks to your efforts and fast deliveries, she has not gone without. I cannot find Kitty Kaviar locally and it is her favorite thing...so that places you on her ""best friend"" list. Thanks again."
1,"Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
1,"This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film."
1,"Clay has an incredible beautiful voice, but the song selections are annoyingly boring! I found myself skipping each sound alike song until I reached the start of the CD...I want my money back. Clay, your CD sucks"
2,"In my opinion the last two foundation books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are alot better than the original three. Isaac Asimov's wrting style has improved, it is a very imersive series that I would recomend to any sci-fi lover. Too bad Isaac didn't write anymore foundation books after this and prelude and forward to the foundation."
1,"Fairly decent ""junk"" reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."
1,Was poor quality and some of the original text was not included- was not as described -should be removed from Amazon
2,"The Boston Globe 7/3/2003 ran a picture of Lauralee and a long story.Immediately I grapsed the significance of her plight and wish others would recognize her life toil for what it is: pure hardship, almost unbounded.I love this author, I would love to see more people in her situation write about their lives.We are truly enriched."
2,"The Zen vision allow to store thousands of family pictures ,Favorites MP3 songs and full disks you have,Control each user use with his own play list,and store films you can easy connect and look through your TV or personaly in the Zen Vision screen.Good control and arrange softwares came together."
1,"If you own a car that you don't care about the paint, then this bike mount is perfect for you. However, if you have a car that you would like to preserve your paint job, then invest in a trailer hitch mount. I personally like my mount but I'm giving it a 1 because it is really tough on the car's paint job. Especially where the 6 rubber tipped connectors attach to different parts of the body of the car. There is a lot of strain on the paint due to the weight of the bikes. The rubber feet on the top and bottom of the center of the device is great but it too will eventually harm your paint. Giving it a 1 because of this."
1,"I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described, more eloquently than I can, why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean, pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her."
2,"I was leery after hearing that it kept products lukewarm, but I tried it anyway. My beverages actually got hotter once put on the warmer! I have to turn it off after a while or it gets too hot!"
1,"This book would only be good for a marine biologist or a latin translator because they are the only people who can translate it. The book might say something like, ""The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius."" You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it."
1,I got one of these a year ago. The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down. That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC.
1,"This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"
1,"I dont see how any one into real brutal music (deathmetal) can enjoy such crap specialy because all the songs here sound exectly like the previous...Why kids call repetition brutality? I dont understand that and never will because? Honestly? I hate hardcore music because only winps and jocks enjoy this garbage. Hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" has nothing good or great about it and all you straight edge fa*gots need to hang yourselfes... I quess im too old for this new generation so i rather listing to my morbid angel or death or possessed collection insted of this and you realy want to listing to actual brutal music? Listing to cryptopsy,disgore, severe torture, dyingfetus, necrophagist, and, devourment. Skip this trash."
2,"Very nice! Great quality. I was surprised, however that I could actually use a bigger one. Even when I make just one latte, my espresso machine does such an awesome job at creating foam - my milk generally foams up and over the pitcher."
1,"I received my new Rhomba, and was all excited to open it and try it out. I open it and go through the quick setup guide and plug it into a USB port on my pc so it can charge up. As I am waiting for the unit to charge I start reading through the manual and come across the following message... The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them....Say What???!!!! I fired off an email to Creative asking them to provide a little more clarity on this statement with no response. Needless to say I am returning the unit."
2,It was a wicked book just very emotional it was great in the sense of friendship between too people. I would recommend the book to just about anyone.
2,"We recently moved and I found myself needing a couple of end tables but unwilling to pay a big price. I ordered two of these, not really expecting much other than to serve the intended purpose. Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be exception quality, substantial wood tables and not the pressed board stuff. Amazing value. I would buy any product this company offers."
2,Awesome movie. Loads of action. Finally find out how Wayne becomes Batman. The 4 previous movies never told you how he became Batman all you knew was he was batman and his parents were killed. In Batman Begins you find out how he becomes Batman. Well worth it. I love the way they set up for the sequel. Katie Holmes is hot.My order of the Batman movies go like this:1)Batman2)Batman Begins3)Batman Returns4)Batman Forever5)Batman and Robin witch was ok but was pretty dumbThe order of the batmans themselves goes like this:1)Micheal Keaton2)Christian bale3)Val KilmarThe worse Batman was George Clooney good actor but not a actor to play Batman sorry George.
1,"This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter ""FILE I/O"", after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."
1,"Besides having numerous errors in the examples, the book has three nasty characteristics: it consists almost solely of small code fragments and commentary; it routinely makes forward references to topics later in the book; and, it uses Struts 1.0 examples to start and makes an annoying (yet incomplete) transition to Struts 1.1. For one just starting to work with Java technologies I found use of the book detrimental to learning Struts. (I had been told it was not a bad reference.) I would have given it a lower rating had the review interface allowed it."
1,"The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."
1,"For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
2,"Note to all first time readers. This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, ""far ahead of its time."""
2,This movie is a must see for teens and parents alike. It may seem like another teen romantic comedy/drama but it is a gentle reminder of the pressures that we place on our children when they are developing impressions of themselves. Well done coming from the mother of a teen under pressure!
2,"Enjoyable, easy to read book. Great investment, tax and cost saving tips. Useful examples, both good (profits) and bad (losses) taken from experience. Lots of historical facts about stock market history. Well worth the price. I don't feel the book is the only book you'll ever need. Took about 6 to 8 hours to read."
1,"This is the first thing I've ever gotten from under armour. Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective. After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling...wishing for a refund, bad luck I guess."
1,"I too got taken in by the ""coiled"" picture. I got a curly cable, not the straight cable pictured ""in a coil."" Completely misleading, I lost my $3.99 that I paid for next day shipping from Prime as well! Total bait & switch. I didn't read the one review on it. Now there are two. This cable is actually about 2 feet long with the coil."
1,Something NOT being disproven[sic] doesn't make it true. Example: You can't prove there isn't a tooth fairy.
1,"Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself."
1,"Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly. E-mail to company went unanswered, except for auto reply. Phone numbers were always busy. Returned the unit to the store of purchase for a refund."
1,I am very disappointed in this book. When I looked at it on Amazon there were pictures. Why was it not mentioned that there were no pictures in this particular book?Shame on you for misrepresenting this book. Now I have to return it and get one with Edward Lear's imaginative art work as well.
2,"I purchased this cd the day it was released and have listened to it almost every day. I followed the idol series from the beginning and thought Clay and Ruben did an awesome job in displaying their great talent. Clay's rich and powerful voice is an asset to the music industry. He is also a very likable guy with his goals, dreams and his honesty. I am looking forward to his next release and hopefully a little better songs to play up the quality of his voice."
2,"love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product"
1,"With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Black Album"" or Cigar's ""Speed is Relative"" or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock."
2,i love michael pitt and appreciate that i found this movie here to add to my collection. disc in good conditon and delivered promptly =)
1,"I didn't like installing this printer at all. It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy, by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark. The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem, following the directions exactly, it crashed my entire system. It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors. Maybe it's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster. I also don't like the color quality. It reads color much darker than what's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint. I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark."
1,"This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
2,"Very well written. Practical applications for implementation in your own family. I did not know how i was going to effectively teach our values to our children outside of trying to lead by example. This spelled it out for me. I have seen it work, my children are embracing these values and are developing characters any mother would be proud of. Even when they do wrong, they are usually aware of it and do apologize sincerely."
2,"My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made. We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again. The movie is THAT fun. I venture to say it is a movie for all ages. Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes. This is one of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of the characters are cartoons. This is a movie where the toons truly come to life."
2,"I bought this for my great nephew - 18 months old who is already learning to count and learn his colors. I also got him a dino puzzle by Melissa & Doug. Both items are really great. They are very durable and colorful so he likes playing with them and putting the shapes back in their places. The number puzzle is fun because when you take the number out, there are pictures under each number for example - take out the three - there are three turtles (I may have the wrong animal but you get the gist!!). His 3 year old cousin that visits often also loves playing with them so they have a good age range."
2,"Remembering my school and college days. reminds the grammar lessons and explaining the rudimentary parts of speech noun, verb, pronoun, adjective, adverb"
2,"Before You Think Another Thought is short, insightful and to the point. It is easy to read and the thought process is well developed.There is no question that your circumstances are a direct result of your thought process. While this is a difficult concept for most folks to grasp, it is true and Doyle does a good job of leading the reader to this conclusion.The book is written in simple terms and has a fairly good set of exercises in the appendix.While the concepts are simple, like any process that requires you to change, they are not necessaily easy. In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new. But they are presented in a fresh and easy to understand manner and can serve as a great way to reinforce what you may have been taught by others.It is certainly worth reading."
2,"This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too. Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders!!!I never climaxed so quickly.I don't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them..boy watch out ;) I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far."
1,This DVD is a very weak release of a terrific movie. There are no bonus features -- including scenes once broadcast on network television -- and Disney went back and changed some of the animation to sanitize it. Here's a big thumbs down and I hope they re-release it with the original animation and with enough features to make the DVD worth the price.
1,This is the 2nd CD that I've purchased of rerecorded versions of Monty's 60s songs. This record label is crooked for putting a 60s photo of Monty on a CD that was clearly recorded in the 80s or 90s. Abysmal. Shameful. Vile. Criminal. An Abomination.
1,"For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound. I don't know if it's just a technical glitch because I'm using the Kindle software on my Mac or there is something else going on. Doesn't seem to be much point in having a book with parts of the story missing."
2,"I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well, I found it! ""Cocktails for Three"" by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.""Cocktails"" goes beyond your basic ""friends forever"" novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine."
1,"Wow, I know that I can be a fool, but I was definately robbed of $16.00, even after reading the front and back of this very deceiving book! I mean, I know that I need help with anger, but this book just seemed to make me ANGRIER! I spent $16.00 on a wanna-be Bible (Something I could have gotten for free at my FORMER Church) and the contents only seemed to anger me more! Not only did half of their text not make sense, their descriptions of anger and recognizing anger only seemed to categorize the entirety of this country! The verbage used and perspective in which this ~story~ is told borderlines an autobiography of a man named ""Tom"". If you like a good bedtime story, like to waste time and money, and do not need real anger management help, then by all means buy this ""novel"". My opinion~ Dont waste your time or money, you already wasted enough reading my review! Kyle...."
2,"This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
2,"1st one sent out was missing a drip tray. I contacted Amazon and waited for a replacement. The new one works great. However, The picture is a tad deceiving. It can fit 8 hotdogs true enough if you use the cheaper hot dogs but, if you use the all beef larger type or longer hot dogs you will have a little problem because there is no way 8 hot dogs will fit on the rollers. the rollers themselves are exactly 10 inches long. Anyway it is a good product."
2,"Truly is the Scorpions at their most power DVD concert performance..twice better than Live in Vienna and 3 times better than the Crazy World tour DVD.. 26 songs covered here from their classic era until the unbreakable album and the best thing is also perform together with former members Uli Jon Roth, Herman Rarebell and Michael Schenker! Wonder why former bassist Francis Bulcholz is not there...anyhow Live At Wacken 2006 DVD is a must for Scorpions fans and Classic Metal fans alike...."
2,i am completely satisfied in the manner my order was delivered.the shoes are just as awesome as the advertisement showed them to be.
1,The other reviewers owe me the price of this book. They are either very gullible or relatives of the author.Thoughts have frequencies and travel faster than light.Need I say more?
1,The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
1,"I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G."
2,"After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read."
1,"Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder, but quality is unacceptably poor. The zoom lever is hard to operate, and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise, really making you nervous. LCD screen is a little flaky, deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter. I think I wasted my money, and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job."
1,"Nicely photographed. That's the end of the good news. Absolutely dreadful script. The main characters stumble around in a stupor and mumble... scene after scene, after scene. After an hour or so it really gets old. Before buying this film I looked over the customer reviews and saw some people loved it an some people hated it. I had to see for myself. I quickly sided with the people who hated it. Maybe you need to see for yourself and decide."
2,"Childhood and Society guides its readers far deep into children's mind and its pychological intricacies. Using study of cases carefully chosen and great psychoanalytical knowlege, Erikson, with his long experience, enlight us, making easy to undertand some of the most complicated concepts in Freud's theory.It's sure a worth reading work."
2,"This novel grabbed by interest from the very beginning and held it to the last word. Gods and Kings is a beautifully written action packed story. I recommend it to anyone interested in history, religion, action.... its a great read!"
1,"I can't share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers.In my opinion, this is a book for advanced fishermen, who already know about fisheries ethics, or don't care about it. The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved."
2,"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better."
1,"I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?"
2,"This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times. It is a fiction for both sexes, as both my son and daughter loved reading and listening to the audio cd's."
1,"Public speaking in narrative form. Lots of stories and examples from Lincoln to businessmen in 1969. Interesting to read. No index, not user-friendly as a resource."
1,"Anne Gwynne was one of those Hollywood supporting players who appeared in a lot of movies, but was seldom recognized. She normally ended up playing romantic leads in B-movies - often a weak person, but with a feisty streak in her that made her too hot to handle for her insipid male co-stars. Made later on in her career, TEENAGE MONSTER has very little to recommend it, except as a poor imitation of I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN. Gwynne tries her best as a parent, but has little to work with."
2,"This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way"" also loved ""Touch"" (sounds like Marc Antony),and ""Perfect Day"" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked ""When You say You Loved Me"", very catchy."
2,"JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad."
1,"I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
1,"This is a great movie - I have it on VHS and I saw it on Broadway. The DVD version is shovelware! No bonus material at all. No subtitles - no alternate languages - no bios - nothing! It is listed as the widescreen version, but it is presented in standard format with the picture and credits running off the side of the screen. To add insult to injury, you have to turn the disc over midway though the movie. Wait for somebody to bring out a better pressing."
1,"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
1,"A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model."
1,"Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for.One punch through soft 26ga copper sheet and the edges of the punch bent & in some areas, flaked off. The second disk I cut did it in completely. I had to file all of the edges and it probably would have been easier to cut the sheet with shears.So, not for metals.However, I can see it would be great for leather, paper & plastics.To me it was worth the money spent on the chance that it would actually cut metal disks."
1,"I starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my 11th grade English GT class's summer homework. I read and read, and I just started hearing names of people who, didn't make sense. I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is, or that other guy they talk about, I just went a long skimming the book, not able to feel any plot whatesoever! I was completely bored with this book. I didn't need a dictionary whatsoever either, but I will probably need Cliff Notes, so I could understand what the story is about, if anyone can help, please do."
2,"I purchase this head collar on advice from a friend. I have been using it for my great dane mix who is a puller. She didn't like the collar at first, but I am sticking with it and she is adjusting. It is well made and working out great. It also comes with some training tips that are helpful. I would definitely recommend this collar."
1,"I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!"
2,I must say I was very impressed with this item. I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship. They were very comfortable; they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price. Another hit! I don't know how these folks do it; but Intimo's prices are amazing! I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants.
2,"what i mean by this batman movie was better than the other twos batman batman 3&4 i think this batman movie is better that following the comics than the 4 batman movies that before it i think as far (micheal keaton,s verison of batman he,s nail ) bale verison not as doesn,t follows the comics and ra,s al Ghul has a pit that makes him young ."
1,"In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere."
1,"This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of ""Dark and Stormy Night."" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized! Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word ""Execrable,"" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."
1,"I kept getting the following error on Windows 2000""monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close"" when launching Disney/Pixar's Mike's Monstrous Adventure (Windows 2000)All my drivers are the latest. Do see what the problem was and the Disney website is of no help. I may have to return the product if I dont get this working"
1,"Note to Norman Jewison: Re-release this wonderful movie in letterbox format, as intended to be shown. TCM shows the widescreen, why can't the public own it?"
1,"This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. I don't know who wrote the questions on this program, but they clearly were not familiar with usmle format or usmle content. In agreement with the other reviews, the questions were totally random and kind of off the wall. If they have the audacity to charge 59.00, they should at least live up to the price tag. You are better off using the practice CD that USMLE gives you for free."
1,"This movie is poor. Very poor. It seems like some art student got ahold of the idea to do a movie about Kurt, and ""went to town"" with the idea. This movie has NO dialog. I kid you not, NO dialog. I understand what they are trying to do... show all the ""strife"" and ""pain"" Kurt went through with his drug addiction, but this movie draws it out for hours... with no plot. And to any Kurt Cobain novice will have no idea what the hell is going with this movie."
1,Just ask questions and give answers. If you don't already know the subject matter asking questions does not tutor you.
2,"My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house."
1,"Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
2,"This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie."
1,This item did not work very long. I made a call and it was replaced but that one did not work either. Just quit with it. Wish someone could design a shuffler that would WORK! It's a great idea.
1,"The faces in the close ups are cut halfway so you basically only see their eyes and you miss a lot of stuff happening in the scenes. I love the show. This is a rating on the quality of the video playback, Not the show."
2,I bought this movie after hearing how creepy it was. I was very surprised how good this movie really was. I really liked the parts with the children calling Elanore to help save them. I am very happy with this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the hottest actor I've ever seen star in a horror movie! This DVD is well worth your movie!:)
2,"I was introduced to this book by a movie on TCM with the same name. The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!"
2,I purchased the paperback version instead of the Kindle version because it was $5 less from Amazon. That is the reason for removing one star. I have just started reading the book and appears to be worth the read hence the 4 stars.
2,"This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!"
2,"Works great, keeps my coffee warm while I'm at my computer. Great price and great results. I would highly recommend buying this product."
2,"If you watch this movie not expecting too much, especially a movie which does not really 100% emulate the game iteself, then you will be thrilled. The special effects are fantastic, especially since they were done in 1993. And the best part...........it's a good a comedy as anyone has ever done. Hoskins and Leguzimo are perfect together!"
2,"When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!"
1,"It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
2,"It's been a few years since a book stuck with me as much as this one. The author has combined an incredible story with detailed facts about the whaling industry of the 1800's. Well researched and a clinic on the human spirit.Also recommended:Guns, Germs, and Steel , Fast Food Nation"
1,"this song is ok nothing special. vocally ain't much to Cassie,but the Lyrics&overall vibe make this song work."
1,I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
1,"Bruce Wayne trained as a ninja? He could single-handedly defeat all the other ninjas, including his mentors? He got all his weapons and gadgets from an inventor in his late father's company? Where did he park his batmobile when he was fighting thugs and rescuing his girlfriend? How did he drive the batmobile there without being noticed in the first place? The ninjas were going to kill him, but when the giant beam fell on him, they just left him alone, to be rescued by the butler???They tried to fit all the pieces in, but ended up leaving too many holes."
1,"""Frustrating"" is what another review said and that really hits the nail on the head. The only suspense in the whole book is waiting to see what the third secret is which takes until the very end to find out. Only to find that: 1. Suicide is O.K. 2. Priests can marry. 3. Homosexuality is O.K. 4. Abortion is O.K. So much more could have been done with this book. How many people were disturbed by the fact that the Virgin Mary actually told the pope to kill himself?"
1,"This is the worst DVD - total waste of money! I agree the only way you would give a 5 is if you were here friend and felt obligated. I have never written a review but couldn't stand it this time. There is very little workout time and mostly rest periods with a blank screen while mortuary music is playing in the background. I think she definitely knows what she is doing, just a shame she made it so boring. F"
2,I used these in the hospital when my baby was born and they are great!Now I have them in my baby bag along with the formula bottles and I always have a clean nipple when we are out. I recommend them.
1,"This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do."
2,"More accessible than some of his others, this book nevertheless exhibits the same pyrotechnic, questing intelligence that makes everything from his hand a delight to read. Excellent translation maintains a high order language as thrilling as it is conceptually sophisticated. The argument is not an academic one; rather, this is speculative writing at its most adventurous. A title for those who consider the brain their favorite organ."
1,"Diapers don't absorb wetness at all, everything goes through clothes! Super thin too! Don't buy it! Waste of money for sure!"
2,"I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
2,"I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!"
2,"Healing From Heaven is a to-the-point book on the subject of God's power to heal our bodies from all types of sickness, today. The author, Lilian B. Yeomans, an MD, is both encouraging and persuasive and helps her readers come to their own undoubting conclusion that God is both willing and able to heal them and make them whole in every way.This little 134 page book is a powerful tool for those who need physical and/or mental healing and for those seeking it for others."
2,"Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying."
1,"I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac's (ridiculously priced)$80 charger. At first it worked pretty good, but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should. i think there is some kind of warranty, so i should try and exchange it...but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second, then stop for one second, charge for one second, stop for one second, etc. It still manages to charge the computer, but im not sure if all this on\off stuff is necessarily good for my computer..."
2,"The book was in great condition and it is a great story, but the seller neglected to include that their was a personal note inside the cover."
2,"Installed these on my 2001 F-150 WOW a Big difference even in big city lights night driving, these bulbs really perform well."
2,"This is a beautiful, healing book with the kind of message, warmth and humor that our fractured world needs so badly. The strength and spirit of this book captured my attention and my imagination. As an author and an avid reader, I tend to look at most books with a critical eye. I found it impossible, however, to assess this book with my eyes or my mind, because it spoke directly to my heart. If you want to tap into and bring forward the highest and best within yourself, this is absolutely the book for you."
2,"I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!"
1,"Bought this seat at Home Depot about 6 months ago. Love the style but unfortunately the seat became chipped. Tried to ""paint"" the chips, but to no avail. It looked horrible. After purchasing a few wood toilet seats by Bemis and having them each chip easily -- I'll now try a plastic seat."
1,"I had to buy this book for a class. It is the most BORING book ever. If you don't have to buy this, please save yourself the misery of having to read it and don't!"
2,"My 3 year-old niece loves to dress up, so we got her this costume for Christmas. She loved it and spent the rest of Christmas vacation wearing it."
1,"I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."
1,Not all that great! The first section was informative while the rest was a wASTE OF TIME UNLESS YOUR A VEGITARIAN
2,"This book is very nice, I do not have the ""Can't put it down"" syndrome but I often find myself thinking about the Characters and where I think the story is going so I like it because it is not making me stay up ridiculously late to finish it but I do keep thinking about it so I'm happy!"
2,"Books don't come much better than this. Elizabeth George Speare does a great job of making history come alive, and Kit Tyler is a fascinating heroine- imperfect yet trying to keep her spirits alive in a strange, unpleasant, and foreign world. Young teenagers may not grasp the complexities of Kit Tyler and her newfound family, but anyone who has felt like they don't fit in will appreciate this great book."
2,"On the whole, the film is quite good. It features excellent action, well choreographed battle sequences, and solid CGI work. The storyline is believable for the most part. The only major complaint from my sister is the ""octopus"" kiss at the end. I agree that it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the film. Other than that, I encourage you to see Prince Caspian."
1,I purchased this wireless camera for use in a medium size model helicopter. Unfortunately the range and quality of the video is quite weak. Even the smallest movement of the camera causes the video to destabilize and lose all detail. Might be good in a fixed location.
2,This movie was soo well done!! The movie inspired and enlightened me. I was motivated and encouraged to want to read more accounts regarding this saintly man. Even if some of the facts ARE an assortment of facts and fiction- it really doesn't matter. The movie truly was indicative of what could be experienced when there is so much goodness in a soul.
1,"Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating."
2,"I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often. However, I loved it as a movie, not necessarily as an adaptation of The Odyssey, which is one of my favorite books."
2,I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.
1,"Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot."
2,"I feel compelled to write about this book. I have lost 38 lbs in 8 weeks using this wonderful cookbook (OK so the first 12 lbs were water and yes I have been exercising). The receipes are tasty and that makes a big difference. You learn a new way to cook without using butters, oils, high fat and high colesterol ingredients. Many items are complete meals without needing side dishes. I particularly like the baked french bread, stuffed peppers, baked fish, and Southwestern stuffed squash. Dieting is not my favorite activity. Food is good. My doctor's advice was to loose weight. This book has made the process worth while. I recommend this book highly. It works."
1,"I thought a book about the early days of SNL would be great fun. WRONG! The most boring book I ever read, next to ""Chemical Analysis of Lithium Dioxide"". Save your money. Its a waste of paper."
1,"Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
2,"This product is good to your muscles after a long hard day. Do wash it before first use, because it has a rubbery smell."
1,"The information indicated that it was a new book for $8. But, when I received, it was an old book and had a sticker in the back of the shown it was $5.60. I can not believe it. I wish I can give it zero rating. But, I can not. It is really bad."
2,"The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process."
2,"This book was hilarious, and the concept was so true. I could see my friends in some of the characters.It seems that Shaw just couldn't resist showing us how crazy the human condition really is by his works that always include funny yet absolutely true twists on things, and his twist on the Don Juan tale is one of his best ones yet.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant."
2,"I have always loved pampers because they are so soft and thin that they seem more comfortable on my baby than any other brand. I have an 18 month old in a size 3, and so far she has had no rashes or night leakage in these. I have used pampers for all 3 of my kids, and now that we are expecting twins I have already stocked up on more pampers swaddlers for a month! Thanks amazon for the amazing prices on diapers!"
2,"I bought these shoes for my daughter a few months ago because we could not find them at the store. It was well worth the risk of buying them the wrong size because they are exactly what she was looking for. They don't look cheap, they're not noticeably dirty even when they are, and for a girl mostly importantly, is that they match just about any outfit. We can't find anything negative to say about these shoes."
1,"I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions."
2,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She used to wear it but no stores around us carry it anymore. Thank-you Amazon for having it for us.
2,I started coaching my son's soccer team for the first time this year. I found this video very helpful for setting up and running my practices. Coach Janaway has great tips including ways to organize the practice field and a variety of well thought out drills addressing various necessary skills. These drills have kept my young players moving and motivated in practice. I have seen these skills later reflected in their game play. I highly recommend this video.
1,"My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches."
2,"This soundtrack is just like playing the video game in a short period of time! If you love this game, you'll love this cd!"
1,"This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!"
2,"These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. Some people criticize that, but I'm quirky...so maybe that's why I like it. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. I'm very much of the mindset that ""if I need meds, I'll scream for them."" From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes. But really, even my husband LOVES watching this DVD!"
2,"We have been giving this to our two golden retriever puppies (started at 6 1/2 mos old) for almost two months now at the recommendation of our homeopathic vet. WOW - what a great product! Their coats are like satin - among all the other benefits it provides (joints, organs, skin, etc!) and they love it! The pump is great and makes it really east to add to each meal; really good price too."
2,I am a native Trini and I was thrilled to see this book in print. The writer covers just about everything and the stories are fun to read. Made me homesick. Would reccomend to anyone seeking island flavor.
2,"Most of these remixes have been available in various places for a while, especially on Perfect Remixes 4, but it's good to have them gathered on one CD. Fans (and detractors), will know the formula by now; dubbed-up, loungey and/or eastern-tinged beats. All good stuff and the album flows very smoothly. A common criticism of Thievery Corp. is that that their original compositions, mix CDs and remixes are all a bit samey but I think that's why many people like them. They provide a cool, unobtrusive soundtrack to people's everyday lives.What do reviewers usually write in such a situation; will please existing fans but won't win many new converts? That's spot on"
1,"I find it extremely funny that the LDS Church doesn't publish books about how to refute the mainstream Christian churches, yet the mainstream Christian churches find it necessary to continually attack us. That's part of what made it clear to me who truly followed Christ, and who doesn't in this case. Christ didn't attack people; neither do we."
2,"I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly. Great service! The look is fun and sexy -- these are cut REALLY low. They will probably reveal a bit of butt cleavage, but my girlfriend and I really like the different look and feel of these quality panties. I knocked off one star because they run a bit small; order a size up if in doubt."
1,I waited many months for this album to drop and when I finally bought it whenit came out I was very dissapointed! I give it 2 stars to stand for the only 2 songs worth a second listen. What we do here is a decent song . Everytime you Go Away is an amazing song but doesn't keep this album from sinking.
2,"I had hopes for this one and it delivered. I liked how I was never sure what to expect, even though some elements were typical of suspenseful/horror movies. It was gory enough to make me cringe, and creative in that it isn't an unbeatable super-monster based tale. I like the ending, and would like to see the alternate, as well. Really good stuff!"
1,"this dictionary is not very good, it is not well written. you ca not find anything on it at all"
1,"I order this on April 5, 2011 and return it to Taylor Gifts on April 11, 2011 they received it and I requested a credit to my account on MasterCard as of May 12th 2011 I have not received a credit. I DID NOT Like this product it was not sturdy enough. Please help me.Mary Lane28 Bonaire DriveHampton,VA 23669Mlane27716@aol.com"
1,"I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart, I would not recommend them to anyone"
2,We are using the activities from this book at our 4-H Club meetings. The age range is from 9 - 18 and I have had not problems finding activites that work for everyone.
2,"My husband was told after his fourth heart attack that nothing more could be done for him, so our family doctor told him to try a vegetarian diet. With the help of this wonderful cookbook he has lost 30 pounds and loves the food I prepare for him from the receipes I get from this wonderful cookbook.The appetizing pictures helps me to choose the menus. I just love everything about this book."
1,"Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies . I will keep the first Transformers movie and forget about the others that followed."
2,"the sound of this record is very particular, may be a little precarius, but you can see right there the talent and the sign of the band.this album is very enjoyable!"
1,"OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."
2,"Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. Why she didn't sing and stretch like these years ago is beyond me, but she soars along with the hot group of musicians and singers with her. I have been playing this CD for months since I got it and I can't seem to get enough. I would have loved to see her tour with this ensemble of musicians with her, but I think she only played in Nashville last January.Here's to hoping she records more bluegrass, but until then I'll give The Grass is Blue another spin."
2,"Bought as a present but everyone had to play with this. Good fun for all, even the adults. Amusing to come back to but can be a bit boring after a while. A good value item with education linked to a toy."
2,"After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
1,"After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this."
2,"I have tried many different ways to store my very large array of shoes and this product is the best. It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations! I definitely recommend this product- get a few!"
2,"I've used pampers for my son. This second time around I've found that I'm still usin pampers but just a different make. They keep my kids dry day and night. Baby dry diapers can really hold a full diaper, especially when your on the go. My daughter has a bit of a waist and these diapers really stretch with her, yet protect against leaks."
1,"We have ordered this DVD set 2 times and we have had to send it back each time. We also bought a set a SAMS CLUB today and it doesn't work either. Yes, we tried to play all 3 discs and in every DVD player in the house. We LOVE the movies and wanted to share the fun with our son who is now so disappointed. Save your receipt!"
1,"Excellent grating surface. Plastic frame and handle came loose within a few months, then the plastic frame just came apart within a year.I'll be going pro."
2,"I saw Bjork in the swimming pool in Laugardalur, Reykjavik this summer. She was oh so friendly to her fellow swimmers and sunbathers. Her charm, hyper-normalcy and magnetic personality all shine through in her music. Post is a rare treat for the soul. In a way her melodic innovation here is as starlingly beautiful as that of the beloved Beatles."
1,"does not fit the new 15"" june macbooks or 17"". the F-Keys are in the wrong place, it fits a Tibook g4 BUT NOT THE NEW MACBOOKS BE WARNED. I sent back and had no problems getting my refund and they responded they DO NOT HAVE THE MACBOOK CORRECT SIZE. you have been warned. I give 2 stars for their customer service. understanding no questions asked."
1,"Aiken initially surprised me with his voice on the American Idol show. I listened to Ruben Studdard's ""Soulful"" Album as well as Aiken's effort. After listening to both, I purchased Ruben's Album and was extremely satisfied. While both artists have great voices, Aiken's album was full of boring tunes suited for Hotel elevators. I wouldn't recommend this album. Hopefully, his next CD will consist of stronger material."
1,I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.
1,"Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."
1,The author is attempting to justify her own choices by putting down working mothers. Do yourself a favor and don't order this book!!
2,"This is the best kids' desk you will find for the money. I can almost guarantee that! It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly. The wood is solid, not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores."
2,"I borrowed this book from my local library for my 4 yr. old who is in love with ""piggies""! She loved it, as did my 8 yr. old, who giggled and asked me to read it again. We liked it so much, we decided to purchase our own. The rhymes are funny and the illustrations are wonderfully drawn and entertaining. I must admit, I enjoyed it as much as they did."
1,This stuff is easily the most trite and cliche collection of prose on love and romance that I've ever read. I was expecting a good deal more. The writing seems to come from the mindset of an intellectually arrested suburban kid who hasn't experienced much of life or the world beyond his college campus and his few so-called love affairs.
1,"I've had this printer for a while now, and i rarely can get it to work properly. When it is not taking 2 pieces of paper at a time, it is printing in some strange code. The quality of the picture is alright, but nothing special. I would highly recommend not to buy this printer"
1,"I, too, grew up Catholic. I, too, have hilarious stories of my experiences. How lucky I feel, though, to have been raised to honor and respect my faith. Yes, my old friends and I still chuckle over certain eccentric nuns, over chapel veils and pagan baby collections, but mostly we feel lucky and richer for this experience. Since my patent leather shoe days, I've been widowed (young), lost my father (young), raised six children...no heartache or challenge has been too great, as I have been comforted and strengthened by this two thousand year old faith Gina Cascone so glibly dismisses. Had she remained true to her faith, some of what she says could be taken as good natured fun. She has instead turned her back on Catholicism and puts herself above sacraments and revered practices and beliefs. Her humor smacks of arrogance and ignorance. How sad."
2,"After going through 2 OEM Apple adaptors, and deciding that I can't justify my budget for power adaptors going through the roof, I decided to try this adaptor.After a month of use, I have to say I am well pleased. This is a great price for a simple product. (Really, how complicated can a power adaptor be?)PRO: It is solid white (although the picture makes it seem not to be) just most like apple products and it does the simple task of powering my PowerBook.CON: It does not have the LED lighting at the base like the OEM does, but this is only a small loss.This is a great value minded replacement. I really can't say you would have any different experience with a Apple adaptor for over twice as much..."
2,"This album is great; I just got a signed copy (available thru Tower.com) in the mail today. If you like the band's song ""Free"" on the Empire Records soundtrack, this is more of the same. However, Joey Santiago (Pixies) does get to venture into more sonically inclined territory. (For a preview, check out ""Flyer,"" the album's invigorating opener. If the Pixies are to return to the studio together, we're all in for good times!)"
2,"I don't see anything wrong with this album. It has everything that I want from a Gordon Lightfoot album: love, nature, longing, and beautiful music. Listen to it again!"
2,I could watch this movie over and over and over again. The graphics were totally awesome. A must see for all.
2,This toy was a big hit at my son's birthday party and my son still loves to play with these tents as well.
1,"Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
2,"Charlotte Gainsbourg 5:55 borrows more from ""Air"" than from her father Serge, and is a complete departure from her previous works. I had hoped that she would've stuck to French, but being the daughter of British singer/actress Jane Birkin (after whom the famous French luxury goods maker Herms named one of its lines), her English is impeccable and sounds quite sexy. This is a good, solid performance, albeit not one that will keep you awake."
1,"Listening to this album is just like putting on the thickest sweatsuit you can find and going for a really long run in africa. Dehydrated and dying rapidly. Nelly helps with this dehydration of hip hop by constantly creating infantile BS songs. I am sick of this monotonous, commercial, ignorant so called ""hip hop"". When will the zombies and sheep get tired of hearing the same song over and over and over again? Avoid this rehash of Sweat and suit as if it is a newly found strand of AIDS. Shakespeare?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! WTF!!!!!!!!! LOL......if shakespeare wrote his plays like nelly writes his lyrics, the masses would've first stoned him to the point of death and then burned him at the stake."
1,"I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them. It has alot of plot & story, and it can be difficult to keep track of at times. Its not a BAD read, its just... very busy, with many many many characters. It was an OK read, but not what I expected."
2,"Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors. I loved this follow up to The Secret, however I too was disappointed that Ramsey and Brigid did not have their own story. I am looking forward to Ms. Garwood's next book and sincerely hope it is a follow up to The Wedding. It is so much fun to go back and ""visit"" with favorite charecters."
2,Descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are accurate and beautiful. The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever. What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort? What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted against great odds? Doig helps to answer these questions. This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest.
1,"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
1,"Better than the previous one (""Body in the Basement"")--Faith is just more interesting than Pix--but Page went back to the whole Faith and Tom don't seem to like their kids and shouldn't be parents thing, which is annoying. Faith is also a bit snobby.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
1,"I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer."
2,"Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
1,"This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone."
1,"I wanted to use this as my desk chairNopeIt was too small and was like I was sitting in the floor.Also, the pump they provide is horrible...pleas to be pumping for another 20 min just to inflate."
1,"Neck harness is a great addition to the gym equipment, however, this specific one is less than comfortable. This harness is the first one I tried so I am not sure how it compares with others on the market."
1,"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
2,"This is one of the best purchases I've made in recent memory. I don't know if it will last a long time but it sure makes it nicer to reach over and take a sip from my beverage and find that it's still nice and warm, no matter when I last filled it. I can get pretty focused at work and my drink turning cold is not a welcome indicator of time passing."
2,"I am a great fan of Jane Kurtz.The Feverbirds Claw was a very good book.It tought you things like,You can make friends with someone who is different,don't judge them for how they look, to be a good friend no matter what,and that you can face you fears on matter how scarey,how hard they look and seem. This is a good book that I think a lot of young readers will really like"
2,With only four stars on the average review for this I had to add a review of my own! I give this five! I would give more but thats as high as we can get here at ama-zone eh>? This book is in many ways better than the book he's referring to by writing it! This is a good gift. Enjoy! PS: try the audio book format of the Four Agreements;theman has a beautiful soothing voice. But get this one in book format to sit under trees this summer and wonder...
2,"Sanctuary is the best and very imaginative in it story lines. I love Amanda Tapping and the whole cast, they are so talented. The bonus features were great too, I liked hearing what they had to say about an episode or anything else. I love Sanctuary, I can not wait for season 3.Big Fan,Christine Martin"
1,"Reading this book, though it was very short, was an incredibly large waste of time! It was confusing, badly written and pointless. Reading a book where the plot is hidden in choppy sentences and weird Russian words contributed to my dislike of this book. Take my advice, if you are going to read this book dont read it before bed or you will most definatly fall asleep!"
1,They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.
1,This product did not work at all on my son's warts. I was not satisfied with it at all. I would not recommend it.
2,"Tre Hardson (of the Pharcyde), is without a doubt one talented individual...this album is incredible and should be owned by everyone interested in hip-hop and quality music...The only artist I can compare him to is K-os from Vancouver, BC...flows, lyrics, some singing...this is dope...and I listen to artists like Killah Priest, Billy Woods, Mr. Lif and Reef the lost Cauze. Peace"
1,"Jim the Boy is perhaps the worst book I have ever read, excepting The Man in the High Castle. When I unfortunately and forcedly (I had to read it for school) partook in reading this horrible novel, I was at first puzzled. Is this supposed to be making fun of bad books?...Jim the Boy portrays the depression-era South in an idealistic manner: the protagonist (or antagonist) Jim faces little hardship at all. There is even less action, and even less plot than the vicissitudes that Jim endures..."
2,"I am a Christian, and I found this book to be very helpful. It touches some personal areas that I wasn't aware of, and it has helped me enormously. I feel like I have a handle on my anger (with God help of course...)now. I recommend this to any Christian who needs it, and I'm sorry if this book offended those of you who aren't Christians. I think it has great basics covered, so even if you aren't a Christian I think it would help."
2,"Dynamic and uncomplicated story that keeps unraveling with the speed of an avalanche.Set in an unexpected surroundings (a hospital), the story evolves around the investigationand subsequent discovery of the true reason behind the murders of the Two Princes in 1483.The writing style is engaging, full of interesting fact and witty comedic nuances that make one oblivious to the time it takes to finish the book. The author gets to the heart of matter without painting unnecessary surroundings. It's a well-written, entertaining book and I recommend it if you have an afternoon to kill.by Simon Cleveland"
1,"While this movie touches on some of the truths regarding Manfred ""the Red Baron"" von Richthofen and Roy Brown, the man who supposedly shot him down, it makes up 90% of it's material from popular tripe and the sensationalistic journalism of the era. If you have any interest in Manfred von Richthofen, or the truth, rent The Red Baron (1988 Queststar) instead."
2,"If there is one book that you read in high school that you should read again later in life, this is it. In fact, I'm inclined to think that it shouldn't be taught until at least college because there is simply no way that any child in high school can truely appreciate this amazing novel. Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always."
1,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. For the first time in my life, I was part of a theater full of people who began screaming comments at the screen as the movie went on, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style, with not one patron becoming upset.That's how bad this POS is. I did enjoy it, because some of the people in the crowd were really funny and it made this awful waste of time palateable. To this day, my friends and I use ""Constantine"" as a punch line.Run, screaming from this ""film."""
2,You cant go wrong with this classic. I beleive most people know what they are in for when they are buying a classic like this..
2,"I streamed this show online, so I could gauge whether or not I would like the series. I did at that time, just as I do now. The show seems to show a great importance in some parts, if not all of it. I could feel great emotion towards the scenes at the end of the story. It was that engaging.The only thing that I do not get is the complaint of a missing episode. After having read about it, I searched for it on You Tube and all I can say is that it would have made me lower my rating to a 4 out of 5 stars. We already get one episode that is kind of like a recap. Why should the audience have to suffer through seeing another recap?Overall, it has a great story and nothing seems to ruin it."
1,I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
2,really work as they said it would instant control. nice walking a dog that doesn't pull you off your feet the moment you go out the door. longer walks more at ease
2,"i expected this movie to be terrible, but might as well see it. I was proved wrong. My favorite part has to be the scene at goofy goober's.FINAL THOUGHT - buy, see, rent, steal,or borrow this movie"
1,"I tried these because I used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers in the past and liked them (before switching to 7th Generation diapers temporarily because of concerns over my baby's skin sensitivity). The price enticed me to buy these, and I was really disappointed. They felt cheap and the performance was poor. LOTS of leaking, in my opinion. Her sheets and clothes all smelled like urine continuously. I couldn't wait to get rid of them. I bought Cruisers in the same size to replace them, and they were a lot bigger. Just an opinion, but to me I'd rather pay more for diapers that work better."
2,Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea. It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.
1,"The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."

2,I liked the book but it wasn't one of my favorite reads. It ended up being a good book overall.
2,"We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade."
1,"continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good."
2,This is the best movie since Monsturds no wait this movie is better than Monsturds even. You will not find a much better than this film. The first film wasn't even close to as good as this 5 stars way up for an excellent come back!!!
2,"As an avid reader of history, I found this to be a very good start for Mr. Patton. He brings to life a real american hero focusing on both the positive and the negatives of his life. Colt Terry was definitely a hero, serving his country in multiple wars and spending five years under fire. His story needed telling and if you enjoy and learn from history, you will enjoy learning about him.Mr. Patton does a great job helping the reader understand life in the Korean conflict as well as Vietnam. My only critique is that i would have enjoyed more detail and this book should probably have been a bit longer as a result.In conclusion, if you have enjoyed Ambrose then this book should also be sitting on your shelves."
1,"The Paid clergy are ""witnessing"" to their flocks to beware of the scarry Mormons!! If the truth be know, the paid clergy and evangelical hypocrites are more intersted in maintianing there meal tickets and car payments. haven forbid that there is a TRUE CHURCH of the Lord that doesn't pay its clergy, and young 19 year old men and women go on missions at their own expense. Gosh, those sound like christ like traits w, wonder why... ALL, PLEASE IGNORE your paid clergy and Evangelical Witnesser's, they are wrong and blinded by money. Seek out and LET THE MORMONS IN. YOU WILL JOIN THE countless MILLIONS who have found TRUE HAPPINESS and TRUE knowledge of CHrist and become a TRUE CHRISTIAN, a MORMON."
1,"I find this books to be incredibly disrespectful of it's own contents. The information is at best laughable and at worst horrifyingly stupid.Others have mentioned the concept of the 'new' triple Deities(as everyone knows that you can create deities just by reading about them in a book and wanting them to exist *real* hard). I also found the concept that these deities would be thrilled with offerings of trash and garbage particularly 'interesting'(by which I mean nonsensical and silly.)This book is garbage of the lowest common denominator. A sheer money grab by a person who lives in a self created commune in a rural area. If I could chose one book to permanently remove from all bookstores and shelves this would be seriously in the running for that spot. Dare I say it - worse then SWR if only because everyone knows she writes garbage whereas people, for some reason, think this is the best stuff ever."
2,"After reading A Princess of Mars, I realized that it is the model for science-fiction/fantasy. The story is still fresh, and Burroughs captured the ideas of inventing alien or fantasy cultures. Some authors have taken the concept further (e.g. Flash Gordon, Star Wars) and others have made a mockery of the model (e.g. Chronicles of Gor). The sensuousness and adventure of this book cannot be denied. It is one of those stories that must be read, as no motion picture or other medium could quite do it justice."
1,"The rollator might have been en excellent one, and was keenly waited for.However, 2 days past it's expected latest arrival time, it had not arrived. The company that was supposed to send it admitted that they had printed the shipping label, notified Amazon and us that it had been shipped, but had not done so.They offered a pink one which was absolutely not suitable for the male user, so I demanded the money back, which they promptly did. I was underwhelmed by the professionalism of that company, and notified Amazon.com about it."
1,"This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features."
1,"The guy Tyler Foster is telling the truth I went and bought the triple pack of feast unrated I matched the UPC # 883476028965, and when I opened it each disc said unrated on it,the guy was not lying I picked my copy up at Frys electronics for 8 bucks it was worth it"
2,This is one of the easiest to follow books on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.
1,"I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was."
1,"I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."
1,"Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight."
1,"I being a big Michele Yeoh fan ordered this Dvd because I couldn't find it to rent anywhere.I hoped that It would be good because I fugured, hey, If she's in it it can't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! The plot is weak and the story is bizarre. If you know whats good for you rent it first if can, if you can't don't buy this dvd."
2,"I received this book from my ex-wife just after our divorce. At first I thought it was a crule joke. But after reading the life 101 book I realized that she could have given me A great gift.. Like the book states, Not all parts will pertain to you at this time, but it is a wonderful refference for later... I have purchased at least 15 of these books. and given them all away.. I usually buy one for myself and start rereading it when someone will say something that relates to a chapter in the book and I point it out to them and the next thing you know there goes another book... at this price it is easy to give them away... MR BILL"
1,"I have had my case for 2 weeks and the leather is peeling off the binding center part. Also, the magnets don't line up right and I have to give it an adjustment to put the iPad to sleep. And last but not least, when I try to fold the cover back so it can stand, it always unfolds itself. If u want a smart cover, I would get the real thing."
1,I received one of these carafes for fathers day last year. After filling every first time you push the button to pour coffee..it pops and blows coffee all over. I have found I have to hold a paper towel over the top to keep everything dry! I have had bad luck with other Oggi coffee carafes too.
2,Great book. Learned of Ben's true character & not the sugar coated stories. Easy read. Read on HTC EVO 3G.
1,I wanted to like it. The amp sounds good but it popped horribly every time it was turned on. It would also pop anytime anything else on the same circuit was powered on. Ended up returning it before it had the chance to blow my speakers.
1,I thought I was going to break by hands trying to get this on. There are like a MILLION little bra like hooks all the way down this thing and it takes FOREVER to get them hooked and it hurts my hands like crazy! BUT my fianc did say that once I had it on he could see the difference it was making but by the time I got it on I was too fed up with it I just wanted it off! Go get some spanx!!!
1,"A faint excuse for hard rock, in any case, would surpass System of a Down's awful music, and their CD ""Toxicity"" is no exception. The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion."
2,This bed worked great for when I had company over. I needed something that was easy and compact so I can store it when it's not needed. I like having the pump built in because there's no chasing the thing around when you need to use the bed again.
1,"this may the only way you can do it. My netgear card would connect but couldn't meet all the security imposed on it...had to buy this expen$ive little darling. Worked fine but I really dislike being held captive to one vendor to use a network. But it IS CISCO so why am I surprised? regardless, performs well and is a bargain at half the price."
1,"I bought one of these for me, one for my wife. Neither kept the coffee warm-hot; more like lukewarm-tepid. Worse than that, they both cracked, after about 4 months. I've always thrown one of them away. I'm not impressed :(We're looking for new ones."
1,"I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!"
1,"I bought this a couple of years ago as a mate was going on about them. Big mistake! There's only one really decent song on it - Chop Suey!, which is actually very good, but makes you wonder how a band capable of this is able to fill the rest of the CD with utter tripe.The lyrics to most of these songs are utterly dreadful, a child could write more meaningfully. They seem to be popular with the 10 to 15 age group, and really is you're older than that stay well clear.One star may seem harsh, but I really cannot bring myself to give it two stars, even though there is one song which impresses me. One good song on an album just isnt good enough; buy the Chop Suey single if there is one, and save some cash and disappointment."
2,"I never owned a fixed blade knife. Love the fixed blade. Small, blade is very secure and won't wobble or come out.However, I can not say the same for the retractable knife. I've had the blade pop out several times due to side torque on the blade. There is a ""feature"" of the knife that allows the blade to be changed without opening the tool. This feature also allows the blade to come loose without opening the tool.I recommend the set simply because of the price/value combination. There are much better retractable blade knives, but not many that match the value of this set. Can not give 5 stars because of design flaw of retractable knife."
2,This earlier work of Jennifer Crusie's is a fun quick read. The characters are witty and entertaining. Dog lovers will also get a chuckle from Ms. Crusie's descriptions of pets. The story is predictable which allows the reader to relish in the delightful dialogue.
2,"This backgammon set is beautiful and if you like backgammon, then it is a great addition to your game repitoire and worth the value."
2,"This bed is great, compact and comfortable. We've had guests who use it ask us where we got it because they want to buy it too."
1,"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The ""story"" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."
2,"This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a ""classic to read over the summer"". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your ""things to read to remain well-rounded"" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"
1,"Maybe this movie is okay for the art-house crowd, or those interested in mental illness, but for me, it was just plain boring. Didn't do a thing for me. Unwatchable. I've seen worse, but wish I'd known what type of ""comedy"" this really was before we paid for the rental.Not recommended."
2,A Must for any Wireless Network User. Hook up is very simple and takes less than 5 min. per Tivo in your home.
2,"I am so happy with this product. My drawers stay neat, clean and most umpotantly organized - I can find everything quickly."
2,"Love this product, makes my skin look and feel great! It's easy to use, no mess no fuss. I don't use it everyday because I like to save it for the weekends because it makes my skin feel so good."
2,"I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well."
1,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
1,"Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker."
1,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
1,"When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase."
2,Had trouble with another wireless adapter so I bought the TIVO branded adapter. It works great and has been downloading all mh TIVO content with no problems.
1,"The DVD is not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes, then the picture becomes stopping and going and keeps that way."
2,this is a beautiful book. the one i had for years got compromised by the mold damage we had in our old home so had to be thrown out. since this was one of my favourite books -- of course i had to get another one.
2,"Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like ""Stupid Girl"" ""Queer"" or ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is ""Temptation Waits."" ""Hammering in my Head"" is great, too. The most popular ones, ""Push It"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."
1,"Shoddy seams and construction all around. First use we got rained on and the tent flooded...The ONLY good thing about the style of this tent was all of the windows and the super thin fabric-great for summer camping, and if there's a chance of showers, the tent will even come equipped with its own pool.We used this tent for one weekend and ended up tossing it in the trash pile on our way out of the park. What a waste."
2,"This is a wonderful read. It makes a great bedtime story and it is also beautiful (the wood carvings) and inspiring. This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!"
2,"This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended."
1,"I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
1,"I put this cd on and my dog started howling. As if there was a full moon. This CD is horrible. American Idol is stupid. If any of these clowns had an iota of talent, they would have signed to a label already ( See Kelly and Justin movie- that movie made about half a million at the box office!). I looked at the notes on the CD. He didnt write one song? So basically someone picked all of these songs for him. This CD makes me wretch. Also, dude is kinda ugly for a teen idol. In fact all of the winners and runner up are horrible looking. WTF?"
1,"Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
2,"This is a book about a high spirited girl named Kit Tyler. She is from warm, sunny, Barbados and is forced to move to cold, snowy, Connecticut to live with her Uncle Matthew and Aunt Rachel. Kit Tyler, with her fancy dresses,tries to fit in but she gets caught with the Witch of Blackbird Pond. The Witch's name is Hannah Tupper. Will Hannah Tupper be a witch? Will Kit make it? Find out now and read The Witch of Blackbird Pond."
1,"Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
2,"If you want to have a succesfull business on the Internet you just need to have this book. I don't understand the negative reviews here. I learned not only a lot of usefull tricks but got a new mindset on Internet business thanx to Corey Rudl.As of yet I applied only 10-20% of the course and grown my Internet business from scratch . Not only did I manage to quit my regular job, but also I now have 3 employees myself.Want to have a succesfull Internet business? Get this book!!!Robert Heessels, Belgium."
1,"Mad Max and Escape From New York are two titles I would consider essential to have in my BD collection, but I will not be buying them in their present state. Why, you ask? Let us do some simple science and maths:Science in the sense of positing a fact: I watch all my discs on a 50"" plasma television, and listen to them with a receiver that decodes 7.1 channel lossless soundtracks via the HDMI ports.Hence, Blu-ray + DVD = NOT GETTING MY MONEY.It really is that simple, MGM and anyone else who is contemplating force-feeding consumers what I now refer to as a holdback format. I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD. So when the UK Amazon offers Mad Max and Escape From New York without force-fed DVDs, guess who is getting my money?DVD is dead. Face up to it. It died the day that BD spoke up and offered us the experience of progressive television."
2,"Bonnie Prince Billy combines soft and fragile melodies with atonal voices. He shows the beauty of error (Note the background voices in ""Just to see my Holly Home"") and the crushing power of tenderness.Like almost everything that is ""REALLY"" good, you have to learn to appreciate this album. With every listening session there is something new that strikes you and slowly reveals the full beauty of this music.This is a true jewel, in desperate need to be treasured."
2,"I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."
2,"I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."
2,"This is the thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld--a flat world, supported on the back of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle, anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.Brutha is a novice in the temple of Om, and he thought that things were very settled. And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (""Psst!"") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"
2,I bought this book because I wanted to try VSCROG. I found the book to have great info on VSCROG and SOG. I also found the book offered other great info in a format that was easily understood. It is a great book for any cannabis growers library.
2,"We love the flatware, due to the design. Attractive and dishwasher safe, but not too sturdy."
1,"Like so many others, hard to believe this ever made itthrough HP QA - I end up hand feeding many, failure over75% of the time!!! Find another machine."
1,"The packaging is so deceiving! I had to have this set. Glad i only paid 10 bucks with ship. i'll be very happy to sell it, break even and get somebody else peeved off at me for selling them JUNK!Usually I read comments/reviews section. this time i failed to do so and i got burned. Caveat emptor! boys and girls. Read the reviews before you buy."
1,"The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for."
2,"In the second half of Season Six we continue to slip away from the early film noir feeling of this series, and more into a sixties flavor. The acting and writing are not at their peak. But Perry Mason is a great show no matter what. Here are the episodes:1. The Case of the Prankish Professor2. The Case of Constant Doyle - Bette Davis filling in for an absent Raymond Burr (who makes a short appearance on the phone, in his bathrobe)3. The Case of the Libelous Locked - Michael Rennie filling in for Raymond Burr4. The Case of the Two-Faces Turn-a-bout - Hugh O'Brien filling in5. The Case of the Surplus Suitor - Walter Pidgeon filling in6. The Case of the Golden Oranges - Perry is back!7. The Case of the Lawful Lazarus8. The Case of the Velvet Claws9.

1,This oil feels like baby oil but more watery and oily. Total waste of money and did not sooth or heal my skin. I have never written a review but I really needed something to heal my skin and am so dissaponted I waited for such a poor product with awful quality and results. Do not buy!
1,"I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up. In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light. It gets very annoying. There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie."
2,"I feel that this, and Morning Glory (the CD that Oasis put out before this one) are the best CDs for those new to Oasis.Why? This is the last CD Oasis made with the core of the original band.Also, Noel is writing very long dreamy heavy rock songs and rock ballads that are well-crafted, yet that go nowhere and in circles but just enjoy doing that, cause that's what it's all about anyway, ehs? Noel's guitarwork is all over the sonic screen, and Liam sounds great, too.A great, long album not unlike all the double-LP rock albums of the Seventies that had vague concepts and heavy chording.Get it."
1,"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
2,"I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star."
1,"I just tried listening to the cd again and still could not find myself liking anything in it. they all soumd alike and boring, the arrangements are so horrible and mediocre and for anyone used to good music this just doesn't make sense.In fairness to Clay who has an awesome and powerful voice, you do not deserve this crap of songs and i hope that he would look into these seriously. please realize that the fans are a varied bunch from the teenyboppers to the older ones with very discriminating tastes. i happen to be one of them, and though i loved all of the AI2 performances i was really expecting something that would be appealing and enjoyable. sadly i find nothing here that makes me want to listen to it again and again.I hope the second cd will be of better quality w/ good vocal and musical arrangement, better songs that would showcase Clay's singing talent."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.
2,I had to reduce my weight but had no idea how to go about it. I had tried several times before but the food I prepared was bland and tasteless. This cookbook has numerous low calorie solutions that are very tasty and satisfying. I am able to stay on the weight loss program and have plenty of recipes!
1,"This book should be titled ""How to Bend Aluminum"". It is poorly written and even worse when it comes to the useless illustrations. It has no business being advertised as a vinyl siding book, and if you should buy it, I'm sure you will find it a waste of your money as did I."
2,Just got back from a 9 mile hike in the Smoky Mountains. These boots did great. Very comfortable and held up well on the terrain. Highly recommended.
1,I gave this item as a gift. I don't have answers to your questions. I thought the doll was very expensive. Diane
1,This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
1,Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open. Anyway I will return what is essentially a pointless product now. Very disappointed.Seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem
1,"I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem."
1,"Here are the problems with using this in the classroom:1. The lines are not numbered, so students will have to number the lines as homework for every scene, or else you'll waste a lot of class time doing this.2. The paper quality is terrible for annotating: Mechanical pencil lead gets caught on the fibers, and any ink but ballpoint pens spreads out.3. Very few terms are annotated in the book, so you'll need to keep your own glossary inside the front cover because there's very little space to annotate.4. Prestwick House has an annotated copy with line numbers, plenty of space in the margins, high-quality paper, scene-by-scene glossary in the back, reader's tips for reading Shakespeare, and extra textbook-type help. Guess how much: 99 cents!"
1,"I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies."
2,"Jennifer Love Hewitt did a not-too-bad job in portraying Audrey Hepburn although she was not able to grasp everything about Audrey. Speaking the truth, playing Audrey Hepburn is a gambling, a risky task in every sense. I don't think that there r more than very few ppl who can really carry the mission, and we can't expect that we are going to see a facsimile of the best actress in the Hollywood history. So, at least, we should give Jennifer some applauses for her courage to take the role."
2,"We already knew that Cornershop represented a unique brew of styles. This single goes two steps further. ""Sleep"" is remixed in a 1983 New Wave style sure to evoke memories of Thomas Dolby and Falco. Norman Cook's incomparable mix of ""Asha"" is already world-famous, own it for 10 bucks less than the import."
1,this is an evil movie two of the actors died of cancer not long after the movie came out sidney blackmer and marurice evans and john cassavetes died also he not that old at the time he died you see the devil in this movie and you see the baby of the devil im no bible pounder but this movie i think they called on somthing evil when they made it roman polanski is evil him self ira levin too in short do not buy this movie!they even had a book of witch craft and devil worship in the movie.
2,"With toxicity, system of a down has really progressed their sound. Better than their first cd, almost as good as Steal this album, But hey i am not complaining, i absolutely love this cd. Not quite a perfected like on steal this album though, ... if a was that crazy. JUST GO BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT AT ALL."
2,I love Pampers diapers. The diapers never leak even at nighttime or long road trips with our babies.
1,"As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."
1,"I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a ""0"". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."
2,"There isn't anything I could say that hasn't already been said in the last sixty years. It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world."
1,"I use the recommended paper for this machine and after a couple of weeks began noticing a problem with the printing. Everytime I print a page, the machine fails to feed the paper through. I have to manually hold the paper in until the machine can grab it and pull it through to print. It's a waste of time and a waste of money."
1,"Worst Diapers ever!! I've been using these diapers for three days and they have been nothing but stress to me. These diapers truly leak even if they are not full. The material that they are made of tear very easily if I even carry my 22 month old daughter the wrong way. I was completely dissatified when I used them when she was a size 3, and I'm upset that I allowed myself to buy these again. They were only a few cents cheaper than the Huggies Snug and Dry which don't leak at all. I used to have great respect for Pampers but I refuse to waste my time with the company to call and complain. I am embarassed to give these to someone, and will end up just donating them."
1,"Caveat emptor -- this DVD release contains a censored version of the movie, different from the previous Laserdisc and VHS releases. It was apparently altered without the director's approval."
1,MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
2,"I love this rice cooker. I mean it. My wife and I are doing really well but if this rice cooker decided to come alive I would totally drop everything else just to be with it. It plays music when you set the timer and again when the rice is done. Even kung fu ninjas would bow in respect to this awesome rice cooking machine. Oh and did I mention that it can keep your rice warm and edible for DAYS at a time?!! And it seriously cooks all kinds of rice. I bet it could even cook magic space rice from the planet Nublargorwidspritezensploog. It's about time I get going. My tasty, warm, day old rice is waiting for me.... mmmmm rice"
2,"Clay's voice is effortless, true, and glides through each song like silk. He is being true to himself, and honoring his fans. Randy Jackson said it best; it's THAT VOICE. That's all you need to know."
2,"When in doubt my daughter will aways eat sweet potatoes. These are good. Sweet potatoes and water. However, they are a little runny. I think they thin it out more than they should. But it is ok. Ella's is my favorite. They have a nice thick baby food. Earths best is my second favorite followed by Gerber."
2,"THIS ALBUM HAS ONE OF THE BEST SINGLES OUT THERE TODAY.I GIVE R.KELLY ALOT OF CREDIT IN THIS ALBUM ""ALOT OF CREDIT."" BUY THIS ALBUM NOW.YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
1,"The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."
1,"Everything that needs to be said was said in ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb."""
2,It's a stylus for a PDA. It's black and round and about four inches long.. Has a fitting on one end to clip in properly. It fits. There is really not a lot that can go wrong with this item.It arrived in a very timely manor. In other words perfect what more can I say.
1,"I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego."
2,"Being a huge Aspects of Love fan, I was extremely excited to find another cast recording. I was sceptical however, after reading reviews for this recording. After listening to it, all of my fears were put aside. This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director. I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung. Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent. A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees!"
1,"The weakest link of the Transformer trilogy; The first two were decent films, how did this one end up so bad? I barely made it through the theatrical viewing, I couldnt imagine buying it and watching it again."
1,"This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. BEWARE! Very cheap material! The sizes are different from what it reads online, and the pieces of the costume are different sizes. For example: the skirt is waaaay too small but the pullover ""boots"" fit just fine. As all the other reviews claim, the outfits ""color/graphics"" peeled off because it was stuck to the plastic package. I do not recommend this unless they are only using it for dress up."
1,"During the first chapter of the book. It hooks you right away. From the moment the characters arrive at the barn it declines. If you have ever seen ""Pinky and the Brain"" these are the characters. Except Lennie is more stupid than Pinky! My two year old cousin has more common sense than Lennie. The book is highly illogical."
1,"When I first heard this song, I laughed. I thought to myself: Who gave her a record deal, she's just plain bad. Than I read a Teen People Article about how she's been around since the 80's, just not in the U.S. But, it didn't change my opinion. Teen People claimed she's bigger than Madonna in the U.K., why? She can hardly sing, her song is bad, I mean, she's not even pretty.Kylie Minogue, is an insult to pop music and a waste of air time on the radio, and that's all."
1,"Seriously, I am quite the fantasy reader. However, this piece of dribble should not have ever been published. It is one of the WORST books I have ever read- in any genre. No plot or charecter development, nothing. If you want good fantasy, go read one of the DRAGONLANCE titles."
1,"Bought the 2005 program in the spring. I've been using this program for about 4 months, now the program prompts me to renew my subcription. I can't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription. Other programs give you one year of use before renewing. I'm not certain if this product is working correctly. I'm going to use a different product instead."
2,"Though a scholarly biography, the book reveals much more about life in a small mid-west America town at the turn of the century than many other biographies or novels. Well worth reading for an insight into ""news"" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon."
2,It's the perfect size for a single serve. It was also very cheap and I recommend this to people who only make 1 or maybe 2 lattes at a time.
1,"I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits ""those notes"", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song ""This is The Night,"" other then that, I would not have rated it."
2,"I though this cd wasn't bad for a first one. I would too like to hear more of his voice, but it seems that no matter what songs he sings, it can melt you heart. I don't have any kids of my own, but this is the type of cd that anyone at any age can listen to without having to worry about the ratings. Good job. He will just get better and better with more experience.Oh and for those of you who are looking forward to Ruben's cd, I heard rumors about it that I'm not sure are true, but many of you might be dissapointed in that one too. I heard it was going to be alot of hip hop type songs and not the soul songs that everyone is expecting. I hope this is not true, but if the cd is anything like the song he sang at the concert, it will definately be more hip hop."
1,"This movie was so awful, I felt compelled to warn others NOT to rent it & certainly not to buy it. Sorry, but this was a stinker. The battle sequences were OK, but they weren't enough to overcome the shallow & predictable ""plot""--there were these incredibly long, boring stretches where the cardboard characters kind of looked at each other and muttered horribly cliche, stale dialogue. It didn't try to be realistic; I found myself going ""Oh yeah, right"" countless times. This really is a waste of time & money. save yourself!!!Or dont say that I didnt tell you."
1,"Michener's books are always interesting quality historical novels. This was is goodhistory but not easy reading. To anyone who was not in the military, his characters mayseem unreal, but believe me, they aren't!!"
2,I bought this movie cause I love all the old movies. This DVD was in good shape and all in all I loved it.
1,"This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
1,"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
1,"I am very disapointed that my teacher chose this book for my class to read. I feel it was very dull and boring, with nothing to keep the reader attentive. Throughout the entire book, there were no exciting scenes (there was one situation where the author could have made an exciting moment, but instead decided to turn it into a section of tasteless humor) and many of the chapters were about relationships between characters which were not explained enough to be interesting, or the various chores and jobs that the main character, Kit, did.I know there are many readers who enjoyed this book, but I personally do not like books who just tell the lives of someone unless there are some exciting events. Too many of the chapters of this book were wasted on petty happenings such as washing clothes or teaching someone to read. If you are looking for a book with excitement or adventure (which is what the title implies), I do not recommend this."
1,"I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
1,"I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews. This product is not a tutor. It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer, if you click on 'Explanation'. This product offers no tutoring at all."
1,For this kind of movie your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. But that's what happened.Only 1 person could act. Most of the women where max 5s. The best part of the movie is the front cover.
1,"I read the reviews on this site and noticed that some said they received the wrong product. After looking at mine i noticed i too had been slipped the Inspire adapter, not the Macally that i ordered (which is far superior to the cheap knock off). I have been trying to contact Clear AV but they are never available..am off to contact Amazon next."
2,"I heard Milk Rock and Spin Spider Spin on internet radio but I fell in love with Tiger. If she were to make a greatest hits CD I would vote for Tiger to be on it. It has a great flow to it like all of her music. On this CD I also liked Gently Waves and Soft Grafitti which are both quietly beautiful. I don't think the length of the song should dictate how much you like it, and that's certainly true of Gently Waves."
2,"Of Mice and Men was an excellent book. It tells the story of two men traveling and working together. Beginning in nature, it gives a sense of peacefulness. As the story goes on you learn about how one man causes trouble for the other. It tells of their big dreams for the future, but with a surprise, twisted ending, you learn there dreams will never come true. It is a very easy read while still giving a good story."
2,This is a very interesting book describing KI and how anyone can use it for various applications in life. Anyone would be happy with this book.
1,"This book was one I read in sixth grade and it was dull and slow. Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England. Sorry Elizabeth George Speare but get your history right!"
1,"Well, what can be said that hasn't been said in 327 other reviews. In short, I found this book to be too shallow and ""bland."" Just lost my interest. This is the first book I have ever given up on. I feel a great shame in not finishing but I just can't subject myself to it no longer! I thought it would be moving and inspiring, instead it was ""blah."" With regards, Max"
2,"The author did a great job. It is a Very high reading in my opinion. Little complex storyline, but very great story!"
1,"I searched Amazon for ""shower curtain rod, nickel"" and this product is returned in the results. From the image, it looks just like other shower curtain rods sold on Amazon; however, this rod is only about 1/2 inch in diameter and will not work as a shower curtain rod. Don't be fooled like I was."
2,"The TiVo wireless adapter is easy to install: plug it into the back of your TiVo and you're ready to go. My only difficulty was in getting it to agree with myLinksys WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point + Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch, which seems like a common configuration. It was a frustrating half an hour before I was able to get everything to play nicely together. (The detection process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be in this plug and play era.) You definitely need to know how your network is set up and be prepared to play with your wireless network configuration application.That said, once I got everything working correctly, the thing has been extremely easy to use: in fact, I haven't had to do anything to it since we put it in. The additional TiVo features that come with always-on access may appeal to some; for us, knowing that we can remotely program a show in a short time frame and still catch it is pretty cool."
1,"I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
2,"I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read."
1,I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing
2,"What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
1,"Ok, just where to begin. First this digital download version is a joke. Someone did not format correctly. Each line is either double or triple spaced, even if you change font. Why stop there? Why not put a word per page?I would like to return the digital download, but can not find a phone number to speak with someone. Or a mechanism to return it.1984 is a good read. Content is good, presentation, not so much."
2,"My friend had a PET except it was blue. It is unbelievable!!! The only bad thing about it is that u have to shake it 15 minutes to even fight a virus! I want red which is the ""#2"" PET. U should get it. My friend said that he made up a chip called the ""sinqule chip."" He made this ""dementional area"" to do this special power. It's called ""down fusion."" He says that it wastes all off your energy, but in one shot... it defeats the guy your versing! He says only one guy has it. HIM!!!!!! I think he's lieing. But remember... get it!"
1,"The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it."
2,Ignore the people who say that he should have sung more adult songs. These are ADULT songs. I appreciate the tone of the album. I'm glad that the CD is filled with new material. IT'S GREAT!!! I think the album has the ability to appeal to all ages if you have an open mind. It's not bubblegum music. IT'S THE REAL DEAL!THIS CD SHOWCASES CLAY'S VOICE IN WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. His voice is so flexible and it's evident with the song selection.Don't listen to the people who complain and whine about the song selection. It's terrific.BUY CLAY'S CD. YOU'LL LOVE IT.
2,This is my second pair. First pair I wore until the soles were paper thin. Still use them about the yard. Second pair was deliverd quick. Fantastic waterproof feature and comfortable. I occasionally spray shoes to keep them in top notch condition. I high recommend these boots. They are perfect also for hikes as I have wore mine on the AT everytime I visit.
1,"Effects isn't the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes. We are having issues with all of them. Photoshop which doesn't normally import huge files is now crashing our Mac G4. I'm running Sony's Vegas Video at home which has quite a few ""effects"" add-ons available from other vendors. If Adobe doesn't straighten this out maybe Sony will take up the slack."
2,"Watched this movie on a whim and turned out better than what I thought. It is a dark, light-hearted comedy with a happy ending."
2,"(I'm speaking as a mom with all boys..) I purchased IZ for my son of 7 who absolutely loves it! IZ's movements and noises are very comical but can drive a parent batty after a while. But in a kids view this is Great. My son can listen to his music on it by linking his CD walkman to it. (also works with MP3 or IPod)Or just listen to IZ's personal music making abilities, which your child can mix up and manipulate by making faster slower or different sounds etc. It is like a personal speaker and a fun friend. My two year old also enjoys IZ and that where the durability comes in. IZ is very surprisingly durable. I was even considering getting him one. Now as for the older set like age 13 (Forget it!!). My 13 year old thinks its ridiculous and the IDog was the way to go there. IDog is the bomb, cool, rad, or whatever these older kids say now a days.....lol Other than that IZ is awesome for the younger set!"
1,"My bundle of joy is 4.5 mo old and none of the other diapers leaked until I started using this one. I tried other brands, Huggies, Luv and also Pampers Swaddlers and they all work fine except this one."
1,To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.
1,"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected. I liked ""Defender of the Jews"" but not the main novella, ""Goodbye Columbus."""
1,"I was so disappointed in the quality of these pencils. I couldn't wait to get them, and when I sharpened them, the points kept breaking! I tried different sharpeners, and lost half of my pencils before giving up. I will return them and continue buying the brand that I've always purchased."
2,"Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading ""the book"" is rather boring and takes a while to read. Overall I would suggest reading it as soon as you can."
2,"I read this book because it was a requirement in my college lit class. Why? because my teacher Dr.Mines (Jeanette Mines) wrote it. Before I read it I figured it would be bad if she is making us read it, but once I started I had to finish it, I couldnt put it down. 14 year old Jeannie falls in love with 16 year old misunderstood bad boy Sam. Despite all the warnings she dates him. It seems from the moment she met him her life has changed and together they are spinning out of control. Will he take her down with him or can she save him from himself? I dont want to ruin the end so Ill stop here."
1,"This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off. If you enjoy being bored,and having your ears and eyes assulted by this low grade quality picture this movie is for you. Reviewed by Paul Phillips"
1,"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."
2,"John Carter, Warlord of Mars, is one of the best known characters of early Science Fiction.The world of Mars, as described is lush, violent and beautiful. It's not logical, but who cares?This is a review of the free Kindle edition, and if you like fantasy or science fiction, you owe it to yourself to try this."
1,"Real boring, that is! (You see how I did that, right, using the ""keeps it real"" phrase to hook you into reading the next line and then BAM just like Emeril Lagasse). An absolutely irredeemable mess from start to finish, and a movie that made me suspect that Mr. Van Sant got lucky with Drugstore Cowboy despite his lack of talent. But that isn't really fair, since he also directed To Die For and Milk, both of which were outstanding. So maybe this was a fluke; maybe he was hung over the day he made this, since it couldn't have taken more than a day to cobble this mess together, right? It was much easier to make than it was to watch, I'll tell you that much."
1,"Fait sur commande et ennuyant a mourir, cette album est tout a fait parfait pour s'endormir...nul!"
2,"This book is great. Mr. Douglas is obviously a very credible researcher and he is also a very good author. From Jack The Ripper to The Zodiac Killer, from Lizzie Borden to the Boston Strangler this book is covering all the great unsolved cases of the last century.I'm giving this book 4 stars because of two things: The very controversial chapter about JonBenet Ramsey, and I thought Mr. Douglas should've shared a little more of his wisdom about the Black Dahlia murder, this part of the book was way too short.But overall this book is a must own for all True Crimes investigators/fans. :)"
2,"the book talks about passion, war, defeat and glory, family dramas and political upheaval. the book is touching and a good reading for understanding latin america and its people. praise for garcia marquez for such a landmark novel."

1,"I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500. I tried it by taking a couple of pictures. Suddenly, the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error. :( That was only 10 minutes of using it. Then I tried it with a Canon G2...still did not work...had to return it..."
1,"Many of the reviews on here praise this movie for it's visual prowess. Personally I think that is like praising a brain dead super model. Yeah, it looks good and the action sequences are crazy. However, it has NO semblence of a plot. The movie as a whole is incoherent, disjointed, and just generally stupid. Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible. I don't know what the director was smoking when he inflicted this peice of shit on the world, but if you have half a brain you will find it as insufferable as I did. Don't waste your time."
2,"I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided."
1,I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring...
2,"If you've ever thought about working in the porn industry, even as someone behind the video camera, photo lens or website, this book gives you a good idea of what you are in for. Take a curious, brave and intelligent woman and thow her together with a very industrious former stripper with excellent business sense and you'll see the sparks fly between this odd couple in this surprisingly suspenseful non-fiction story."
2,"Because of its extensive bibliography and excellent index, this biography of William Procter, Jr., serves well as an introduction to the origins of professional pharmacy in the USA.For more information about the book and its topic, contact the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy (AIHP)."
1,"I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
2,Bought this for my mother. She loves to read and this book was great as she could connect with it..
2,"This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens."
1,This story has way too much profanity. It is difficult to get past the use of the words to realize the meaning of the book.
1,There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form.
2,"It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."
2,This is a must read for every Man. It is spiritually up lifting and you don't have to be a preacher to get it. I could not put it down once I started. This is going in my Library and I will revisit it often.
1,"How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made. Get the original 1963 version or read the classic novel--BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE!"
2,This book is thoroughly enjoyable. Although it is only a short novel. You will fall in love with the characters and the story.
2,This is an interesting series for someone who likes watching medical dramas and it has a great cast as well.
2,"I picked up this album without knowing what was really in it. I liked Xenogears, I liked music by Mitsuda. But this album combined the Xenogears songs and the magnitude of Mitsuda's work into a rather lively, fluid, and beautifully rendered celtic-themed album. All the songs from first track to last is filled with celtic-style renditions of the game's songs at their best. And all the low-quality midi voices you heard in the game has been turned into a glorious vocal performance on this album. Every tune seemed to have a life of its own, making this album have a unique personality. The only flaw I found was a rather repetitious feel of every song and that there weren't enough tracks on this album. But this album is certainly worth picking up."
1,"The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also."
1,"You will hate yourself in the morning if you buy this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. IT LEAKS - HORRIBLY!One full cup of water runs out of the base of the coffeemaker onto your counter top and down the front of the cabinet. I purchased two of these coffeemakers, one for my son and one for me. They both leaked. I threw mine in the trash and replaced it with a Cuisinart. Save yourself some grief - don't buy this coffeemaker."
2,"Five greats with William Powell and Myrna Loy. First, is Manhattan Melodrama which is a drama, duh, starring Clark Gable and a few other people you may recognize. Then the mystery thriller, Evelyn Prentice, which is sure to please those of you who love courtroom movies. The next three are all romantic comedies. Double Wedding is one I can watch again and again and is one of the first films I saw with both Powell and Loy in it. I also enjoyed both I Love You Again and Love Crazy. Each film comes with a cartoon, a vintage short and one disc even has a Radio Show. Great classical movies, some OK for the family too!Get it, watch it, enjoy it!"
2,I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. This is my favorite show. You must buy this TV show this is the best ever. I have been watching this show since i was little. I just love John Ritter shows and movies he is so funny. I'm going to miss him. Rest in peace John.
1,"This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
2,"This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
2,"It's nice to read a book like this. There is a very light tone through the book. And it's a short book, incidentally. You will finish it in about 2 sessions.I was happy to see that I'm not the only person annoyed at the way graphs are shown, with the bottom cut off to dramatize changes. This is only one example out of several. You woul be able to figure out some of these yourself, but not all of them. One was a bit deep and I had to read it a second time to understand what the falsity was.I recommend this book because it imparts valuable information in a readable fashion. Statistics are everywhere, and you absolutely must know how to separate the chaff."
1,"A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."
1,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
2,"A Love Supreme might be one of the most recognized jazz recordings. You have to read the liner notes as it describes what Coltrane was going through at the time and his devotion to God. This is Coltrane's attempt to honor and praise God. It is an album of devotion with Coltrane at his best. McCoy Tyner plays piano, Jimmy Garrison, bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Haunting, powerful music."
2,Thsi book is the greatest. I really covers everything baby would want to know when she gets older. My warning is that you better start writing the minute you get it or you can miss important days as you get so busy when baby is born. Try to get this item before baby is born so that you can acquaint yourself with the information you will need to enter. GET IT!!! My only regret is that one day after I bought it my sister bought me one so I could have saved that cash. My sister returned it.
2,"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."
2,"This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully ""out"". Living people (referred to as ""warm"") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."
2,"It's a literary masterpiece, realistic as it can be, Goodbye Columbus makes you feel as if you were 19 again. Neil's way of looking at life makes him a very interesting protagonist. For example the way he relates to the little black kid of the library. Roth really scored a hundred with this book, he makes the reader relates to the selfish feeling of a typical College student, like Brenda. It makes you laugh going into two different mentalities such as Neil's and Brenda's. What makes it the best is that at the end the reader can make his own conclusions about what happened in the story and why it is name like that."
1,"Other actor: No way!KR: Way! He was, like...a bunch of BUGS-n-stuff. But I kicked his ass.OA: NO WAY!!KR: WAY! Got a smoke?OA: Does the Pope wear a funny..oh, sorry dude. No offense.KR: Just give me the damn cigarette.Fade to white then to breathtaking shot of Rachel Weisz or Tilda Swinton."

2,"Works fine on the PowerBook G4. Doesn't have an LED to tell you it's on and, of course, doesn't have a smart plug to show charging status."
2,"A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable."

I take the charger out of the bag, not box, and plug it in only to find that it does not work - it's not charging at all. No light, no power when I put the battery back in my camera. Will ship it back very soon for a replacement or refund!"
1,"I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half."

2,"The Dogg-Father Hoodie is made of quality materials and is very well constructed. Our boxer puppy, Sancho, looked so cute (and he is from the LBC...); it would have kept him warm on colder evenings.Unfortunately, we needed an XL and I haven't been able to find that size anywhere.Comparable hoodies in pet stores are not nearly as high quality. If your dog is about 30-40 pounds - and not too chesty, Snoop's Dogg-Father hoodie is perfect!"
2,"This band is great. I loved it since I first listened to it. You just need to listen to the first 2 minutes of the first song on the CD, and you will fall in love. Some LA rythm mixed with afro-tribal-punky-jazzy metropolitan atmospheres. Great, there are also birds singing in the background. A true bible of love and peace, only that it is written in notes, and nice words too in the lyrics! Peace :-)"

1,Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
2,"After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"

I do a lot of video transfers from my computer to my TiVo using Vuze, and I am able to begin watching a show as soon as a transfer has been initiated; the transfers have also been error-free.I was concerned about the adapter's ability to connect with my computer, as my laptop computer often has issues getting a strong signal in the room where the TiVo is located, but it doesn't seem to be the case.The price on Amazon was considerably lower than I found anywhere else, especially when combined with the free shipping offer.Overall, I can't recommend this highly enough!"

1,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
1,"The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
1,"Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.Its quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.Its obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins...."
2,"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."
1,"This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment"
2,"!Heather's teenage son!All right, all right. What's so bad about this movie? Really. Sure, it's got some crude bits but to me those are some of the funnies parts. And there is nothing wrong with Sandy having one line. She's not that important of a character, anyway. Do you see her often in the show? I do agree that Squidward needed a bit more screentime. I think he's quite funny. I love the TV show, and I loved this movie when I viewed it in the theater on opening night. The ending is most definately the funniest part of this little flick.And for those who think he is homosexual...You've got to be kidding me. He's supposed to be childlike, not homosexual. And what's so bad about homosexuality anyway? I have friends who are homosexuals. So, all of you overly obsessive Christians can go shove it. I'm a Christian, too but it's not right to bash homosexuality or the people that practice it. Sorry for the rant, but things like that do make me a bit mad.PS...Patrick rocks.4 out of 5."
2,"This book is not only one of the best Sci-Fi/ fantasy books, but a work which compares well with those considered contemporary classics. It is as if Terry Gilliam and Kurt Vonnegut got together to combine the story of Buddha and the rise of organized religion at the same time. If you enjoyed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" by Vonnegut, I think you will really enjoy this."
2,"I love every song on this CD. It's an exceptional change from the nasty, derogatory music being churned out by the cookie cutter pop stars. Clay Aiken breaks the mold and amazes the mold maker. He delivers to the heart. Each song touches you on a very human level. True to himself, this is Clay."
2,"With More Action and Violence in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian I would say this is one of the best Narnia Movies I have seen. I do wish it had more of adventure like the first movie.About 85% of the movie was one big battle. It doesn't beat The ""Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy in action, but it does have more creatures. As a movie critic for Prince Caspian, I give this 4 out of a possible 5 stars."
2,"I ordered this dress and recieved it the next day. It's a gorgeous dress made from a good quality material. The only problem for me was the sizing. it was way too big! When I ordered, I ordered a large based on my hip measurement needing to be that big. I should have went with the medium (which was the right size for my chest/waist measurements). Luckily, the dress fit one of the other bridesmaids perfectly so i didnt have to send it back. I reordered a medium and it's perfect!!Thanks to pacificplex for making it possible to get beautiful bridesmaid dresses that are inexpensive, and arrive quickly (the wedding is in 2 weeks!!!)"
2,"This book made a huge impression on me in college in 1980, and I have kept my copy to this day. I quote from it all the time when people use numbers in a gullible fashion. In this day and age, when the numbers just keep getting bigger, not being cowed by statistics and mathematics seems a very worthwhile skill."
1,"I have two girls and a boy, when my daughters were in diapers I always used huggies, but when my son was born they did not keep him dry through the night so I switched to Pampers Baby Dry because that was the type of diaper that claimed to be best for boys, but it is not, my son leaks through all over his clothes and the person holding him and the diaper itself is nearly dry. It is as though the diaper can not absorb the pee fast enough. I would not recomend this product."
1,"My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile."
2,"I love horror/thriller movies but rarely ever get frightened from them. This movie was great. I was genuinely scared. I think that this movie has the best ""monsters"" in a long time. Definitely getting it for my dvd collection."
2,"I love the second it was great and a good movie for the children to set and watch. Ti was alot more fight sceens in the movie,i think the best ones yet. This movie all together made me want to go and buy the bboks."
2,"This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent."
1,The title pretty much expresses my feelings about this book. It was incredibly boring. I purchased it because my professor required me to read it. It was literally hours of my life that I will never get back.Totally Lame.
1,"I got this toy for easter. From the comercials I thought the toy would be an action game like a pokemon where it would be in color and I would meet other animals and play with them. But it seemed to be just like those Giga-pets and Tomaguchies. You would get to costomize your pet like what the personality is, but that is the only difference between that and a Giga-pet. The game is completely black and white. One of the things in the game that I didn't like was that you needed to feed your neo pet at certain times of the day and if you feed your neo pet later than that certain time it dies. I would suggest buying it over summer vacation becasue if you don't you'll have to feed it during school."
1,"I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her)."
1,"First time I tried the extractor, it busted off inside the bolt. Very hard metal, but so hard that it is quite brittle. Very little amount of free play, and doesn't let you put any torque on the bolt at all, so if it is rusted in there, forget about this set! Seems like a cheap knock off of the ever so popular ""easy out"" set.Now I have to figure a way out how to get the stupid thing out of my bolt so I can drill a new hole and tap some new threads in. Can't drill it out because the metal is so hard, it is chewing up my drill bits."
1,"The book is so painfully simplistic, it looks as though it was made in one sitting. How could we possibly insult our children by making them think they're THIS ignorant?One child was swift to point out, ""Does Larry have a last name, too? Or is he sharing the last name of Lilly? As in 'Harry and Lily Potter' do?And I had no choice but to confirm that yes, there is indeed a reason why these books are so.. uh... disturbing. They're related. And happily dating.Btw, the first book, ""Larry Potter and his best friend Lilly..."" you can clearly see in the book cover that Lilly, for a best friend, is a little too snug on the ""personal space"" touching. Even Ron wouldn't be caught in that pose with Harry and they're REAL best friends! So does that cover count as a spoiler? Cause for some strange reason ""More than just friends"" was more of a joke than a surprise. .Glad it was borrowed and not bought.And grats on little Kathrine smart enough to figure out the mystery behind the nonsense! <3"
1,"I find this book is in poor taste, notwithstanding the attempt to put a nice cover on it. Not authorship, but cut and paste out of the Bible. I did the same thing as a kid in CCD. But, make a book out of it? Ugh! An absolutely awful example of using the Bible to sell books. Don't support this kind of thing."
2,"Having heard most of the Bonzos' catalog (or catalogue, if you're in the UK), off of assorted collections and the Cornology boxed set, I leaped at the chance to own the original CD's (and this was the last one I purchased), because of the bonus tracks. As always, Neil Innes provides sharp and witty banter recounting the history of how the Bonzo tracks came into existence, and the music never fails to delight, especially 'The Craig Torso Show' where I would have nearly fell about laughing if I wouldn't have been in the car ('Craig Torso smells wonderfuuuuuuul'). Minus one star for again mis-labelling Sidney Nicholls (aka Big Sid, the guy playing banjo in the numbered group shot) as Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell."
1,"According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices."
2,"A set of wonderful stories about REAL people that rose to the challange of Nazi Germany and with our allies eventually defeated that threat.I do have one small observation. All my life people of my grandparents generation ""The Greatest Generation"" have been telling that if there was ever another crisis like World War 2 we couldn't handle it. Well we did a preety good job after September 11th didn't we?"
1,"It is obsolete piece and requires paid subscription - the little thing I have overlooked. For just a little more you can get DVR with free OTA (Over the air) everything - for free. This one will go directly to a landfill. Without the activation it even can't be used as a ""VCR"". Piece of junk."
1,"Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John."
1,"I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"
1,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
1,"So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con. He did not know much about it, but heard some people talking about it in the food court. I thought it sounded awesome, like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader. So I order what I thought was the graphic novel, turns out it is more ""novel"" and less ""graphic"". It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think ""BANG!"" ""POW!"" or ""ZORT!"" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name. His physiognomy is dead on as well, like in all comics, it let's us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all. Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars."
2,"this is just a great movie, nothin needs to be saidjust watch the movie and you'll know whyo yeah, did i mention, its an awesome movie!"
2,"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this CD. But my 2 year old is a huge fan of the show, so I took a gamble and that CD doesn't owe me a nickel. It is just as clever as the TV show with the same format. The new songs are entertaining for both of us and the old stand bys are there so he can sing along. It is terrific. The only problem is there is only one ""episode"" on the market. Please hurry and make another one!! I think we know this one by heart!!!"
1,"They are OK diapers. We have always bought Huggies, and after using these diapers, are firmly believe in Huggies. These get full too quickly and then becomes very very hard to deal with. Our duaghter wasn't comfortable in these either, and constantly complained."
2,"I bought this book after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that book. From this one I have made the teddy, the cloud pillow and am about 70% of the way through the kaleidoscope blanket (I decided that knitting 49 squares was too much like hard work and so adapted the pattern to be knit all in one go on a circular needle- its going well but maybe the squares would have been easier!). My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows. I plan to knit the star and moon blanket and the kitty cat jumper next. This is a lovely book with plenty of fabulous patterns."
2,I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.
1,At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
2,"""Fahrenheit 451"" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give ""Fahrenheit 451"" five big stars."
1,"I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store. I ended up throwing them out and going to the store. Don't waste your money. The top part of the head rotates, but the bottom half does nothing. The ""real"" ones, both parts of the head rotate. I don't know why this even says CREST on it."
1,"This stick is extremely dangerous. I tried it to remove a small wart from the top of my foot, and it created a major chemical burn on the skin surrounding the wart. It is incredibly painful and now I'll probably need to have the wart surgically removed, which I was trying to avoid. I'd rate it NO stars if I could."
2,"This was a different kind of story...I like different, so it was good. It's not your typical comedy, but it's not a real drama either. Obviously taking place in a psych ward of a hospital, it's got both humor and serious moments that were well done by the actors."
1,"As with the other reviewers, this printer worked fine for a short while, then I started to get the ""out of paper"" and ""paper jam"" errors. I contacted HP, and was told that I couldn't connect the power cord to my surge protector and had to go directly into a wall outlet. When that didn't work, I was told to unplug the printer, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in, then repeat 3 times. At this point I decided to just return the printer."
1,"I suspect if you're a Garwood fan you will enjoy this novel. To me, her novels are all too similar. With Ransom, she takes the reader yet again into the highlands with a bit of mystery, adventure, clan-loyalty, and romance. Actually, the romance aspect is debatable b/c attraction is NOT romance as far as I'm concerned.Garwood's characters are all the same, she merely changes their names in each of her books. I'm not saying they are dislikable, just redundant. Other reviewers boast this is Garwood's best highlander romance; if this is true, I am not interested in reading any others. It wasn't awful, it was just the same old stuff."
1,This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies but this is so far beneath him I can't imagine why he would even do it.
2,I love this book. It is some cool. I always look words up whenever I am stumped in music theory or just in my practice. It is a very good buy!! I recommend it to anybody who is into music. :)
2,God and Kings was a book I simply could not put down. It was both exciting and saddening to understand the plight of King Ahaz and the impact it had on the life of Hezakiah! I would highly reccomend this read to anyone who longs for a taste of Old Testament history.
2,"I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve ""the Party"" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."
1,"I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series."
2,"After reading these reviews I bought one for each of two nephews and one for my husband, which he doesn't know about. After receiving them, I took one out and we played with it and couldn't stop it was so much fun! After that night, I hid them so we couldn't play with them anymore and now I can't wait until Christmas so that we can play with my husband's!"
1,"Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."
2,Thanks for the great price and movie. It was really good. But of course I love the 1st one the best.
2,"I have to say that I have been a little less enthused about music in the past 5 years. However, for the first time in years I am just blown away by the EXTREME talent of Clay Aiken. I have never heard anything quite so beautiful, than his voice, in all of my life. I love EVERY song on this CD. I got this CD when it first came out and I can not stop listening to it. From the second I get in my car until I get out, that CD is blasting in my car!! The enthusiasm that I have for this talented man's music is indescribable. I feel like a teenager again because his music makes me scream with absolute joy. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone because the intensity and electricity that exudes from his voice is miraculous!!"
1,"A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. The idea is enticing, but the quartet's execution is awful. Truly terrible. Dull. Choppy. Uninteresting. Same. I'd say boring, but I can't stand to listen to it long enough to get bored. It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just ""The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M."" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too. Sorry to say it, but this CD is truly awful!"
1,"Lousy,couldn't be worse. Isn't worth the small amount of money.Wasn't worth the wait for delivery.Makes me more careful in the future about cheap products."
2,"I've read few dating books from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Author will show you the most common mistakes guys do when dating with women. It really makes dating simple and fun. Thanks Corey!"
1,"I saw the tour of this ""album"" as a GI stationed at Lindsey AS Germany in 1982. They played two songs from this CD; first they played ""Under Pressure"" which the crowd went nuts for. Then they played ""Body Language"" and I swear the crowd went stone quiet. Needless to say, the band didn't play another song from this album. I only give this review two stars because ""Under Pressure"" is when of the best songs they have ever written. Other then that, like my German friends in 1982, I find this to be awful. The worst in their glorious career."
1,"This book is the most boring book that I ever read. I mean, all we see is this guy who has a broken leg, and who's trying to solve a mystery that occurs decades ago. What's the point?"
2,I bought the Black and the White ones of these. The BLACK is much nicer looking. Is not too bulky and allows you access to all the functions. Can't beat this!
1,This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.
1,"One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story."
1,"Like everyone else, I had the paper feed problem. However, what's really awful is the customer support. I service rep in India took the call, and while I knew exactly what the problem was, it was like talking to a robot. All the rep could do was follow exactly what his script said, then he transferred me to someone else who asked the same exact questions all over again.HP was so gung-ho about offshoring all of their customer service. Well, since I can no longer GET any competent service I certainly won't be an HP customer again."
2,"When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary."
1,After all the good reviews I read of this book I thought I would love it. Usually I enjoy biographies. I found that this book is written in a style that makes the story a bit difficult to follow. I gave it my best shot but I did not enjoy it at all.
2,"Released in March of 1980, DREAM STREET ROSE had all the makings of a classic Lightfoot recording. Every track shines on its' own. The opening track ""Sea of Tranquility"" is mesmerizing with its' blend of steel, electric guitar and keyboards. This should have been the first single from the album. ""Sea.."" is definately one of the highlights as is the title track, ""On the High Seas"", ""Whisper My Name"" and ""If You Need Me"". This is definately the BEST record that Lightfoot has created."
2,"On a number of occasions, it had been suggested that I read this book, and I must say I'm very glad I did. I got very involved, as the writing was so wonderfully descriptive. Having said this, I don't think it was arduous to read all that detail, which sometimes makes reading a book feel a bit of a chore. I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,I love every song on this album and think Clay will produce even better in the years to come. Go Clay!!
1,"Right from the beginning, with track #1 (""New Life""), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on ""sweetness"". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on ""Speak and Spell"" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (""Puppets""), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (""Just Can't Get Enough""), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two ""pretty boy"" songs: #4 (""Boys Say Go!"") and #6 (""What's Your Name?""). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it."
2,"She's ""got the beats to make ya burn"" - This is the future of Hip Hop. These 10 songs (plus a ""hidden"" bonus track) are fascinating and fun. The ""extra"" re-release track ""U.R.A.Q.T."" samples the theme of TV's ""Sanford & Son"". My favorite tracks are ""Hombre"", ""10 Dollar"", and the steel-drum laden ""Bingo""."
1,"Book describes a situation so unlikely that that this should be categorized as science fiction. The writer badly misjudges trained soldiers and abused children. Although (mysteriously) this book appears year after year as a must-read for school kids, I think it should be relegated to the fluff fiction ranks of Sweet Valley High and The Hardy Boys. Characters are only developed in terms of their reactions to each other. No depth to father (just plain evil for no reason); no evident psychological damage to abused child (except hatred for father); soldier appears to be the least-trained soldier in the German army. It's just a badly composed story."
2,"Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German."
2,"High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
2,This is the most informative series on Goju Ryu in print. Absolutely a must for all goju-ryu karate-ka.
1,"Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you."
1,I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste.
2,"Seen it 40 times. This movie is perfect. It is astonishing that it was made so long ago.The entire movie is a buildup to the final sequence where she accepts the child. Though shocking, we realize it's not the least bit of a surprise - given her devotion to what she carried for so many months.Best line: ""He has his father's eyes"""
2,"The book basically is a story about how even a single person can make a big difference in the world. If you want to make the world a better place, you can start with onself. Although the odds may seem overwelming, persistance and patience prevail. It proves that brilliance is necessary to explain complex issues simply.The video is also excellent for children below the reading level. It is a kind of stop animation done with pastells, I really like how the artist makes a beautiful simplistic video explain an issue that could be construed as complex."
2,"I loved this book the first time I read it, and when I first picked it up I had trouble putting it down. I was fourteen when I first read it, so I would recomend it to people in that age group. However, there isn't much deeper meaning to the book. If you're looking for a fun, easy, dramtic book, this is perfect."
2,"I received this perfume for my birthday years ago and kind of forgot about using it. Then when I re-discovered it, I absolutely loved the fragrance. My husband kept saying ""What's that fragrance you have on? What are you wearing?"" It was always So De La Renta. Then I ran out!! Getting it for Christmas was super. And using Amazon is so convenient since we live in a small town where department stores are non existent."
1,We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
1,"One of the legs broke in two, the bike flew off the rack on a highway at 70mph, damaged beyond repair. Don't get this plastic piece of crap. Look at the image, its hollow inside, there is no reinforcement of any kind."
1,"I consider it an amazing feat of strength that I managed to sit through this entire movie. Within the first 20 minutes you understand what's going on, so then you expect something to be done about it, but NOTHING HAPPENS! You try to convince yourself that the movie must be building up to a great ending sequence but it just isn't there. Without question this is only worth seeing if you want to find out how bad films can actually be."
1,"I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,"I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
1,"I usually love Pampers, but the Baby Dry Pampers really irritated my little boy's skin. He didn't have any leaks but the angry red marks on his skin negated the leak free aspect. If your baby's skin isn't super sensitive, these would be great but if your little one has sensitive skin, skip these and go for the Swaddlers."
1,"I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
1,Unless you have soemone at home to press it one hour before meal. Otherwise it takes at least 40 minutes to make rice ready. It is not good for both those couples without enough time for cooking. It take 1 hour and 30 minutes for stick rice. which is crazy for me....
1,"Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so."
1,I wanted something a little more specific to the African American child in terms of race and self esteem considering the prejudice that my child will have to come to terms with.This book only offered one chapter on that and not a very insightful one.
1,"I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing."
2,The book was in great condition I just didn't realize it wasn't the book with the foot notes....But service was great!
1,"I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!"
1,"If you are looking for the Audrey Hepburn Story, then this is most definately not the place. While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more capable of telling the story. The title role was horribly miscast, and while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to conquer such a role. I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten seconds of the film). While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the ""real"" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere."
2,Good story line for a hockey movie. Fun for the kids to watch and always a good one to bring up when you are around high school hockey players. A movie that all kids have seen in their lives if they enjoy watching hockey.
1,I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
2,"Choosers of the Slain is a decent book and a slightly new departure for the Paladin of Shadows series, as Mike takes to tracking a stolen womam through the western European white slave trade with the aid of a squad of his Keldara retrainers. The core store is sound and like the second book, it is a single story rather then three short stories the way the first book was. As with the other two books in the series, there are some fairly graphic sex scenes - a bit too much for my personal tastes as it happens - and lots of guns, violence, and women. Overall I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I do have to say that it wasn't as good as either the first or second book of the series."
1,Product was small to size. Return policy sucks so I kept it. Perhaps I can pass it on to someone else......
1,We bought this baby dry I think this is great mistake done by me. Its getting wet so soon. Before we were using cruisers but we thought why don't we try this once. Never ever buy this pampers baby dry.
1,"This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
1,He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
1,I have been using Pampers Swaddlers size 3 but because of the outrageous price increase I switched to Pampers Dry economy pack......my child's linen is now wet in the mornings and blowouts have been horrible. And now I am stuck with 2 boxes of unusable diapers. How could Pampers sell such an inferior product. I am switching to another brand and another source (such as Costco) from now on.
1,"This book is far too basic, with information easily found by a quick internet search. Scarce on facts and high on opinion, this book was clearly written with someone unfamiliar with medicine but with marketing savvy."
2,The shoes are great-looking and even though they don't look very comfortable they actually are pretty comfortable after breaking them in.
2,"This Is Family Viewing That SAD To Say Is Almost Forgotten & NEVER REPLICATED NO MORE!!! A POIGNANT STORY., & a VERY GOODE VIDEO for a Family Library or For Those Who WANT Something GREAT to View/Share With ""SPECIAL PEOPLE @ SPECIAL TYMES!!!!!!!""I ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND., ""To SIR With LOVE!!!!""If Hollywood Kould Do It Like THIS AGAIN.,The WORLD WOULD Be a BETTER PLACE!!!!!!!Thank You!"
2,"Another great puzzle by Sunsout. This is the more traditional squarish design rather than the nice widescreen-sized puzzles, of which I am becoming quite fond. That is the only reason I made this a four-star review rather than a five-star. The pieces on this one, while nice with a superb amount of variety in them, are average in size, making this puzzle fragile like typical puzzles once put together.The many different blues in this puzzle are incredible and really make this a very beautiful item. There was just the right amount of difference in the shades that it was not too hard to put together. The mix of gold shades in the wisemen and the camels stand out just enough in contrast to the blues.Very good puzzle!"
1,"This song stinks! Trust me. Try your luck with the import single, maybe those remixes are actually worth listening to."
2,"I love this machine. It makes perfect rice. I've tried long grain white, short grain brown, mixed, and steel cut oats too. Always perfect!"
2,"I got this HD-DVD from this website for like 13 bucks and watch the Batman Begins on my add-on 360 HD-DVD drive, the picture are amazing on my Optoma HD70 on my 25 ft wall, amazing detail and so ALIVE! The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed. Yes, I mean Batman Return and Batman Begins... they're both amaziong and well-made movie. I can't wait to get the rest of the other batman movies on HD-DVD!"
1,"I got nothing out of this book. I've read many self-help books, and this is among the worst. McWilliams provided worn-out cliches, and the book reads slowly. If you want good selp-help books, check out Denis Waitley and Anthony Robbins."
1,"I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey."
2,"The strengths of this production lie in the detailed instructions for the preparation of various types of tea, mainly Chinese, and the bits and pieces of tea lore imparted in the interviews (although individuals familiar with the world of tea aren't going to learn much new from them--but it does bill itself as an ""introduction"" so no surprise there). The videography is artful and the selection of tea vessels used during the preparation of the various teas is a visual delight. My only real complaint is that the amount of footage of the processing is much less than I expected from reading the promotional blurb. Personally I would have liked to have more material on the processing."
1,"I had this game for almost a week before I sold it to EB Games (when they were still buying used PC games). If you're looking for more of Rome: Total War just get the expansion pack, not this. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so limited that I felt like I was watching someone else play. The units were way too small and the controls weren't very fluid. Having never been a fan of stragedy games before, I went on the prowl for some after Medieval: Total War but found that Total War games are the only ones I like. Some others like the technical aspects of campaigning in other games, but I'm more of a battle map player. So if you loved Total War, stick with it. Stay away from similiar games."
2,"This is Roger Zelazny's masterpiece; a highly imaginative thing of beauty, Lord of Light tells its story at break-neck pace which will appease even the most easily bored reader. The language is fluid, often times poetic, and ultimately a feast for the senses. The story spans many years and depicts the epic struggle of one man who could have been god, against all those who now rule the world with an intolerant fist. Technology is precious, and hidden from the general populace who are forced to live in a sort of perpetual Dark Age so that the gods they worship may continue the turpitude that is their tyranny. The Hindu religion is used to exploit its followers and the pinnacle of its precepts--Reincarnation--degenerates into nothing more than a bargaining chip to further accentuate the gap in power. Roger Zelazny is an innovator without equal and one of the most important science fiction writers to date."
1,"This was an incredibly bad product. Yes, it has a chamber for water... why I do not know, because it NEVER produced steam! If you want something to curl your hair with steam, I suggest a Caruso Professional SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter."
1,"I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."
2,ok its a good book with a plot that a 3rd grader can understand i know this because i read it in second grade so a 3rd grader should have an easier time. and as far as the word that someone complained about you need to read context clue plus they are not that hard. this is a good book and show the predictions that Verne made. like scuba diving and nuclear power in the 1860's. and btw thats scuba diving with tanks of oxygen and thin wet suits to keep you warm truely he was a genious. i would buy this book read the whole book 3 times during the year but only when i am boged down or i have trouble with my studies.
1,"k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song ""Invisible""- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room"". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."
1,"Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
2,"Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
2,"I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed ""WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist""...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."
2,"My daughter eagerly anticipated the release of Clays CD, and I must admit I'm hooked as well--How refreshing it is to have a young pop star that [doesn't use] vulgar lyrics,condone violence, drugs, etc... or has sold out! Unlike most of todays CD's, this work contains several songs that are excellent, and could become big hits-In fact, I like ALL of the songs! Several of the songs give me chills, even though i have listened to the CD a dozen times...the songs grow on you..and that voice~~~its just something special! Clay, thank you for helping me believe there are good, decent people among our youth~!This young man is a great talent, and role model for my kids.Today's singers could learn alot from this kid.I will buy his work anyday.Hurray for Clay! *****!"
1,"After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala.This muffler is only 15"" long and does not compensate in any way for the factory 16"" muffler.I ended up with a total redneck rig installation. WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."
1,Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me .
1,"Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book. End of story."
1,Grrr! Grrr! Yo tis is wat hommies who bought the full 2 albums feel ya. So cheated ya. 4 new songs.... an' we hav' 2 buy the new album for only 4 songs! Yo I wanna scream!
1,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
2,This is a very effective toy. After rolling a few 7's or 11's it becomes obvious that even a cursory examination will expose cheating methodology.
2,"From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric"
2,Excellent book. This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend.
2,"Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
2,"Flyboys has been severely critisized for being historically inaccurate. However, for all other reasons this is a great film. The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film. So if you don't worry about the historical inaccuracy, this is a film you will enjoy. Join me next time for my reveiw on the 2004 film National Treasure."
2,"Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self. We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more. The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television. Brilliant show just keeps getting better!"
2,"this movies is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. i watched it 3 nights in a row once. some times when i didnt have the best day i watch this because it always makes me laugh. this movie is funny, yet it can touch your heart. its about a girl who lost her short term memory in a car accident and a guy who makes her fall in love with him every day. you gotta see this!"
2,"I love this book!! It is an easy read and provides problem-solving approaches and communication techniques that improve the behavior of children, teens, and adults. It further identifies social issues resulting in the breakdowns of our moral intelligence with reminders on how to improve."
1,"This exercise video is not fun--none of us like it. The moves are not hip or fun, and they become monotonous and boring, like you're waiting for it to end. It seems really old or outdated. The instructor is friendly and happy, but her face is really sweaty during the video. The sound quality is not the best. There must be a better kids' exercise video out there--we need some fun, hip, new moves with a great beat and really good music and alot more energy! This dvd is not worth it-invest in something else, like a huge exercise ball--we all love that!"
1,I didn't care for this one very much. The zombies weren't very scary and the whole thing just kind of fell into a rut.
1,"this clock looks pretty cool but the quality needs to be improved. it's absolutely not worth of $$.i bought one with an AC adapter last year which cost me $$ more. i like the LCD to constantly show the time at night so i didn't care the extra $$.it took a long time to receive the radio signal from Coloroda. but it was pretty easy setting the calendar, date, day, time and alarm. i was very happy about it until this February. the LCD suddenly went partially blank. i wouldn't even guess what time it was showing. i thought the batteries ran out so i replaced with a new pair. yet it still couldn't display the time properly and the LCD turned totally blank in a day."
1,"This rack is a piece of junk. Within 1,000 miles, a part has fallen off, the pin bent, the frame sagged, and has rubbed my $2,000 mountain bike frame down to the aluminum. DO NOT BUY THIS RACK.For the initial journey, I put only three bikes on it for a long trip. The weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed. After my first leg, I pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly. So much so, I removed all bikes to ensure the rack was not failing. I found the pin bent only after 400 miles! As my trip went on, the rack continued to disintegrate. The rubber frame protector holding the frame to my bike fell off (don't ask me how as it was snuggly fitted to my oversized mountain bike frame). The metal to metal rubbing destroyed my paint and rubbed through my hydraulic brake line. My kids' bikes were also rubbed, dented, and scratched.Buy any other rack but this one. I personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes."
2,"This has got to be one of the best films i have been priveleged to see in a long time. The realism is just insane coming from such young actors. they just didn't play the part, they were it. There's moments in this masterpiece that you flat out forget you're watching a screen. a must see for anyone who likes good cinema."
1,"I only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places.I would say that the ball's tension would fall under the ""easy"" category.I'd recommend the Power Web over this product."
2,"Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: ""Push It,"" ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,"" ""Temptation Waits,"" ""Special"" Rating: 8/10"
2,"Chances are if yer not Australian yer not gonna understand TISM... from the band that brought you ""Defecate on my Face"" and ""There'll Never Be An Ole Man (River)"" comes their lastest. Tackling the hard issues... ""I might have screwed yer sister but I never screwed yer mum... I might have gone to uni but at least I know I'm dumb""... Yes.. they can rhyme with the best of 'em... but in the end its just good ole fashioned TISM! R U A YOB? nuh... yer a wanker... I'd actually say this was one of the best things out this year."
2,"Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's.It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography.Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise.I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes."
2,Great to deal with. Very quick delivery. Very highly recommended. Thank you.
1,"Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card."
2,I found this book as well as Vaultreports very helpful for anyone hoping to succeed at shifting jobs or careers.
1,"I bought the AudioSource Amp 100 to replace a 30-year-old Harmam-Kardon that had died - I used it to make cassette copies of old phonograph records. The Amp100 does accept the signal from my turntable and pre-amp and puts the sound on the speakers, proving that there was nothing wrong with my system but the dead stereo amplifier. However, although the Amp 100 clearly has stereo output jacks, the signal there will not provide anything useful to the cassette deck. Way down in the fine print of the instructions I discovered that this ""output"" is referred to as a ""pass-through"", which apparently means it is unamplified. Phooey!"
1,"well, it's kind of hippy, hoppy, someone learned to play the slide, and i suppose there are some beats on it, but man, it sure is a great big disappointment--this music is not challenging or interesting or even all that different. if you just want something that will go in the background or maybe while you're chemically enhanced, this will do as well as a doors record or something else, but it is not worth any hype at all. it's like low rent version of Arnold or maybe Gomez. they obviously think that they are very cool though. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... hubris......"
1,I bought this shoes from your site.. and only wore them once.. to find out that the sole of the shoes is starting to peel off and the strap in front of the shoes just came off !
1,"Constantine is a horrible movie. The first hour of it is just unexplained occurrences. In a movie, it is good for things to be unexplained at the beginning and gradually explain themselves as the movie goes on, but when it goes on for an hour, you get bored and stop caring about the characters. Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up. Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade. None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring. It would be a form of torture if someone made me sit through this movie again."
2,Looks and fits great! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform. He loves them....
2,This is a great pot.. I used to microwave my frozen vegetables but now I steam them and they come out looking lively bright colors. I also use the other part of the pot for other things also and cleans wonderfully.
1,"I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there."
2,"I've just finished reading this and must say I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect the story to be such a clear picture of a woman's psychological maturation. The story's protagonist moves from self-pity through a life of concealed pain, and ends with her final triumph. It holds up a mirror to the way we live our lives, firmly stuck in ourselves - and when all of those prejudices and ego-tricks fall away, we get to see reality from a wider perspective. We are changed forever.The book is classic Lewis - moving, funny and entirely compelling."
1,"This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps..."
2,"I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5'er. The came on time, were well packaged, and work exactly as they should work. I had a tiny leak in one of the originals, and so replaced the pair. Very happy with the results."
1,there is no words to describe this movie! all i can say this movie sucks and it was awful!
1,"As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
1,"I only have one word to say about it...""NOT RECOMMENDED""...but still you can go ahead & waste your $ 10 to find out...Good Luck"
2,"I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!"
2,"I have never been a fan of american idol but heard the song ""Invisible"" on the radio and loved both the song and the voice of Clay Aiken. I went out and bought the cd and it is full of amazing songs. I think people are putting too much emphasis on where he has come from and need to listen to the music's lyrics and hear what he is trying to tell you. I thought each song was beautifuly sung and appreciate the message and work from the artist."
1,"Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most partwith a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in themain role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot hasbeen said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this moviehas to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she doesmake you care about what is going on with the movie while you aretrying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is beingtold. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movielike this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essencethere is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiececompared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at thevery best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star.If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in the negative numbers"
2,"I have read bad reviews of this product and I think the expectations weren't reasonable!What this warmer does is give me back the bottom inch of my coffee, which I've never finished because I can't stand lukewarm coffee. The top half is always piping hot, but I suck that down right away anyway. This warmer keeps the bottom of my mug ready to drink when I get to it.I got jewelry for Christmas and I love it, but this is the best gift that will truly keep on giving.If you want your full drink to stay piping hot for any time, I suggest don't pour it til you're ready to drink! If you want a place to set your coffee that will keep you sipping hot coffee to the bottom, this is your product!!!!!"
1,this is the worst band i have everheard in my life. I would rather listen to debbie gibson all day long.their politics are lame and their chord changes are boring and uncreative.more like the worst cd of 2001.
1,"While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try ""Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry."
1,"If I wanted a map of Texas I would have purchased an atlas instead of this boring book. The author had a good idea, but despite that, the only reason I even finished the book was because I had 100 pages to go and I was too damn OCD to just leave it at that."
2,A number of reviewer have reported what HP's support site reports - that the LaserJet 1020 does not work on Windows Vista. Just use the original driver CD that comes with the printer and run the installation on Vista. The installer automatically detects the printer and installs the driver. This printer works perfectly with these drivers on Windows Vista Home Premium edition.
1,"There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute."
1,"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. ""Nuclear"" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"
2,"This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."
1,"First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now."
2,"I still think Arms Around the World is, to date, their all-time best. Blaze is creative and fun, and even though it is ""praise and worship"" it is still plenty original. And they have at least gone back to their original sound, which is where they sound best. Still yet, none of their stuff impresses me quite as much as Arms Around the World."
2,"This is one of the best video concerts ever. The sound, visuals and performances are top notch. It is a real joy. I have owned it a week and watched it 3 times already. Every performance is good. There are no dead spots during this concert and you get quite a number of them. A keeper. Memorable."
1,"Terrible book. I'm not into classics, so if you're like me, don't buy it. If you like them, buy it."
2,"The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, ""I could not put it down."" This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."
2,As a Birth Doula I purchased this ball to test it out before I reccommended it to my clients to use as a birth ball. It was easy to blow up with the hand pump provided; it only took about 20 minutes (following the overnight directions) your arms get a bit of a workout! I have had friends and family using it and not being exactly gentle! It has held up well. I reccommend following the height guidelines when you purchase your ball. I have all three sizes and they really are for the heights they reccommend. I think this is a good product if your looking for an exercise ball or a birth ball.
2,"This book should occupy a prominent place in your collection. Yes its ok to own more than one book on sartorial correctness. Take this book for its strenghts (i.e.,the correct way to buy fine clothes) and don't worry about its drawbacks. This is an excellent source for learning about the theory and practice of dressing like a proper man. Much has been made about the outdated addresses of some of the stores in the second half of the book. Well my response is..get over it. Fine mens stores change addresses, its a fact of life. The important thing is the name and description of the store. With that said, sit back and enjoy the text and pictures and take responsibility for being a well heeled gentleman...if you dare."
2,I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn't get them to stay in. these made it work!
1,"I've had horrible reception with this antenna. I've tried all the tricks to get it to tune in to local stations and it only received maybe 2 of them. I decided to try something else and bought a Terk HDTVa antenna (also off amazon) instead, and I have to say it is amazing. night and day difference."
1,"Never received item, vendor not very responsive or helpful via feedback - did not reply for days. Ended up cancelling order due to long delay between order date and vendor never providing proof of delivery. Ordered on 1/5 and cancelled 1/27/09. I still have not received confirmation nor acknowledgement from vendor of the cancellation - I ended up disputing the charge. I will not order from this supplier again."
1,"It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only."
1,"Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."
2,A very nice surprise and excellent music. This album shows off the many vocal talents of Clay.Great Stuff!
2,"I bought this for my 3-year old's birthday. The main reason I bought it was that it included Bob and Wendy. For $15 I knew the set didn't include that many pieces. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, we've managed to recreate all the houses pictured in the brochure. No, they're not the most sturdy things, but my 18 month old can even make a tower with the magnetic pieces. And I've noticed no pieces that can come apart as a choking hazard.As far as the Thomas the train sets, yeah, they're better quality if you want to go ahead and blow hundreds of dollars on that stuff. A set this size in Thomas land would cost $50 at least. This is a $15 plastic set. What do you expect?"
1,"This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing."
2,A HUGE FAN OF JOHN COLTRANE AND ALL HIS WORKS. MY ONLY PET PEEVE IS THIS ALBUM ISN'T AS LENGHTY AS I WANTED IT TO BE.
1,"Super Stupid horror movie that has really only one good performance in the entire film and that belogs to Rachel Weisz, who really does do much for this crap heap while Keanu makes a fool out of himself and the rest of the actors make Keanu look like an proffestional actor.The one star goes to Rachel Weisz only."
1,"The quality of the materials was very disappointing, also parts of the orignal book were deleted. This was especially bad because it was for a gift. Further, I will not ever have any item gift wrapped. It was pretty cheesy."
1,"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
2,U ARE ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS AND IN THIS SONG THE TWO OF U SOUND ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. WHEN ARE U COMING TO INDIA
2,"This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!"
2,Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.
1,"I did not like the texture/material. The fitting was also loose for me. Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts, these shirts were disappointment."
2,What a fast read...well researched and edge of your seat...a great combination for the voracious reader.
1,"If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. Cristina is great but this cd is obviously taken from vinyl and sounds horrible. You can actually hear the record static and the high hats will hurt your ears. I'm going to return mine."
2,"This is just flat out the best rock cd ive ever heard. The best drummer ever, he even enspired me to play the drums. Really good guatarits. This gruop is really heavy and there drummer rocks, for example listen to the begining of needles. Don't double think about buying it, just do it. you wont be sorry trust me"
2,"I bought this tape to get the Juice Newton video ""Can't Wait All Night."" Back in the 80s, country videos were scarce, only a handful of songs got the distinction to have an accompanying music video, as it was a relatively new medium. This VHS has 7 classic videos from RCA recording artists. You hardly see these anymore on TV. Alabama's ""There's No Way"" is one of their all-time classics, as is Ronnie Milsap's ""Lost in the 50s Tonight."" The aforementioned Juice Newton song ""Can't Wait All Night"" is awesome, I first saw it on [...]. We also get the Judds' ""Love Is Alive,"" Waylon Jennings' ""America,"" Kenny Rogers' ""morning Desire,"" and Earl Thomas Conley's ""Crowd Around the Corner."" 7 great videos from 7 great country superstars! Let's hope this sees its release on DVD someday--soon!"
2,"Purchased this book knowing full well it was outdated, but for a beginner in PDF forms this was and is and excellent purchase. Came through quickly and in Excellent condition. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting out creating and making forms more user friendly. Great Job, can't wait till the next book gets released... please put it on Kindle, Nook and iPad versions as well as Print."
2,"This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well."
1,"This album is a big disappointment. Their self titled album caught me by surprise- i liked ""Sugar"" and was really shocked to hear that the rest of the album was just as good and better in some places. They had catchy guitar work,crunchy rythms and those intense vocals. Now the lyrics are just annoying with simple phrases screamed over and over. There's no melody in these songs, and the guitar is nowhere near where it was on the last album. The last album was so much more creative. Toxicity sounds like what you'd get if you asked some teenage SOAD tribute band to make some new songs. What happened?"
2,"Elton John returns with 11 very seductive tracks on this release. The melodies are strong and he sounds great! Particular stand-outs include ""Someday Out Of The Blue,"" which is the first single, ""Trust Me,"" ""My Heart Dances,"" and ""Friends Never Say Goodbye."" A few more EJ tracks would have been better than the instrumentals included at the end of the album. Overall this is a fine body of work. The first single is probably the catchiest of the songs on this release, and a good follow-up single to this one would be ""Trust Me."""
2,I went to a Hilton and slept on the most comfortable pillow and then bought it. I love the softness of the down with the firmness of the foam that also keeps the quills from poking me in the head.
1,"This movie was screwed up all kind of ways.It wasn t even like the video game or even the cartoon.For example,King Kopa didn t look like how he supposed to be and the storyline seem like it was written by a 4 year old.I wonder if the director was on drugs while he was making this so called movie.To all the people that didnt see this movie,you don t need to because you will regret it.Its so bad that it will be perfect to be shown on MST3K."
2,The proofs are well structured and easy to follow. The techniques used in the proofs lend themselves for use in other situations. A lot of information is embeded in the exercises which keep the students alert and focused and at the same time saves time and space. A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis.
1,"I bought this for my daugher on her birthday she liked the doll, but she did not love it. She said, ""it was fun she enjoyed doing her hair,but it was not hat fun."""
2,"A number of books about substance abuse have come out since ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,"" but it still should be on the bookshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Gordon's straightforward description of the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms endured by a recovering addict has a powerful universality. It helps all of us understand the complex and excruciating process of recovery. - Ann Seymour, author of ""I've Always Loved You"""
1,"Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,"I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed."
1,"I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."
2,"This is one of the best things I've seen on television- ever. The story, the acting, the action, the filming- all first rate. I have to admit that I thought the end was a little contrived, but when I gave it more than a moment's thought, I realized that a man could be ""a woman scorned"" and end up shooting himself in the foot while trying to get revenge for the wrong done to him by others."
1,"Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
2,I am not into reading books much but I had to purchase this for a project for school. As i started reading I had gotten into it more each page that I read. I like this book and the price was right. If you are looking to get it don't hesitate buy it. This is coming from a guy that doesn't enjoy reading books.
2,"Having been a horse trainer and riding instructor for the past 20 years, this is the best book I have found to use for both new horse owners and riders. it should be a ""have to"" for all horse people."
1,"Nothing is more irritating than seeing the message: ""this movie has been altered from its orignal theatrical presentation. It has been reformatted to fit your screen"" when your watching it on a WIDESCREEN TV and you END UP WITH BLACK BARS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT! How arrogent of them to assume that ""your screen"" will always be an old-fashioned 4:3 format TV!!This may be the only DVD I can think of that isn't available in widescreen. Save your money and spend it on a product produced by people with more regard for their customers."
1,"I'm clueless as to what happened with Jazzinho's second album. I loved their first album. I waited months for this second album. I felt the songs were uninspired, and the arrangements odd.I hate writing this review, but this album was not my favorite. I didn't even like ""The Lagoon Monster"" which was one of the singles they released from this album. Very disappointed."
1,"He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep."
2,"This is different from the ""Asian Saga"" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way."
1,"I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. ""A Light in August"" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated."
2,"It is simply amazing how, for a book written so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age...It does make you wonder...and makes you more aware of your own behaviors."
2,This book is simple to understand even amidst all the details it provides. The explanations are clear and concise while explaining all the jargon and convention. The Vollhardt text also gives a really good background to why reactions occur rather than plopping reactions on the page.
1,"poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
1,"This diaper is OK during the day. It is very thin, flimsy, feels really cheap, but it is sufficient to hold a medium-size mess during the day. However, it leaked all over every single night no matter what we tried. I would actually test different diapers every night, and this one would always have the most leaks all over. Cruisers did a bit better, Huggies did as well (actually as bad) as Cruisers...but, still there were leaks every night! If you are used to Swaddlers, be ready for a huge disappointment! This diaper cannot be used overnight. Our boy is 13 months and 24 lbs,and is long. Even tried a size bigger as it was suggested. Had to go back to Swaddlers...size 4 (sensitive-the only type of Swaddlers in 4) and no more leaks! There are never any leaks with Swaddlers!!! Pampers Baby Dry is the worst Pampers diaper I have ever used!!"
1,"Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. This story I found to be much to long and tedious. The concept of a ""bondage vacation "" was much to comical and contrived. If erotica is what you want to read pick up an Anais Nin book. Anybody that can read her work without starting to get a rapid heartbeat is gotta be senseless!!"
2,"I just love my Multimedia Player. I can play songs, listen to books and store pictures to carry around with me. The screen is big and sharp so you can see pictures very well. I have not tried to play videos on it yet and I have not had any problems so I don't have any complaints."
1,This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!
2,"This was a very enjoyable read. The passion, attraction and love between Clint and Mattie could be felt through the entire book."
1,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer and ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev with G. Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to ""Facing the Extreme"" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."
2,"Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads."
2,"the wax smells good. The quick detail fluid does great job. If the price goes back to ~19, I'd like to buy another set."
1,"I bought this book hoping it could help me understand shakespeare's words better, but it didnt. Instead I had to look up every other word in a dictionary or sometimes even online. Soon it just got so hectic that i just threw the book out and bought a better more reliable source."
1,"This video was a huge disappointment. Bought if for my small kids, and it failed to keep their interest. Not only was it slow, but the acting was poor. Rascal the racoon gets little screen time for a movie in which he is the title character. If you're looking for a good animal movie, Charlie the Cougar is a huge hit with my kids, and their friends. It's classic 1970's Sunday night Disney - a treat for parents as well."
1,"Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
1,"I was disappointed in the book because too much was relied upon letters written to her. I would have liked more of her own imput. Maybe I just didn't understand it, I don't know."
2,"This CD is a must buy.It has awesome mixture of pop and R&B.Stacie Orrico has a beautiful, powerful voice.This CD is for anyone who likes Britney or Christina but hates their lyrics.My favorite songs are, ""Don't Look at Me"",""Stay True"",and Genuine""."
2,"After the new TAs known as Fakes arrive on the scene, a batle starts and ends in a sand storm. That fight is continued later in the episode as the team of TAs walk right into the Fakes' trap. The battle concludes leaving the TAs with a sample of the Fakes. The second episode is even more intense as the JSSDF scuries to get the TAs out of Belgistan, but then Yushiro runs off again to see Miharu. Miharu and Yushiro become targets of Symbol, but get rescued by a man named Phantom. Phantom gives them a place to stay and Yushiro gets picked up. The crew of the JSSDF takes off back to Japan and are then forced to take on Armekistan aircrafts with a TA latched to a steel teather. Seeing Captain Ataka trying to talk in English was a very funny part of the subtitled version. There is a lot of funny stuff on this tape that you can only get in the subtitled version. If you can afford it, get it. Its worth it. Action, intrique and little bits of humor. The perfect show."
2,"This book is a fascinating historical account of the atmosphere of America during Reconstruction. The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters. Add to this his endearing stories of the white and black races, and you have yourself an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable read."
2,"This movie was good, and the second one was even better. The third one was a piece of poop though"
2,I like being able to read these books since I don't own an Xbox and am not good at playing video games. It's enjoyable to have the story unfold without restarting.
2,"This is a fun movie for anyone, but especially for the kids. Let them watch this movie and be amazed how excited they are to watch the adventure of Mario and Luigi over and over again. It works as a kids' movie, but even as an adult or parent you'll find things to enjoy. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed."
1,"This is a rewrite of my 'Batman Begins' review, which i just wanted to make shorter and more to the point-****Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).but i would skip this one.peace out & cheers!-CrowTurtle"
2,"I just returned from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, and I found this book extremely useful for Cambodia. Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap. The Vietnam portion was helpful as well, but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country. I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition, which is *really* outdated."
2,"As other reviewers have righly asked, how was this not a big seller upon its release? So many good songs, sung so well. I never tire of listening to this one."
2,"Get this movie!! If you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this incredible ride of a film. Cage is nothing less than brilliant."
2,I play this with my grandchildren. It teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all. You sometimes miss the most obvious. Lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist!
1,"Although Poul Anderson is not a typically a particularly bad writer, most of the prose in his portion of the book ""Pele"" is so bad as to be laughable. ""Tyra had more and more enjoyed her voyage, until near the end."" and ""The last weekly dance of the trip became an especially gleeful occasion."" I didn't even have to look very hard to come up with these gems. ""Memory stabbed her again."" Ha!It's almost as if it English was the author's second language.If you like authors that torture the English language you'll love this book."
1,"The book is definately a disappointing follow-up from Mail Order Bride. Its so hard to like Annie, who is out for herself and very immature. Usually in historical romances a 20 year old is a little more mature. So it makes it difficult to root for her and Colin, when all you want to do is smack her in the head.I love Maureen McKade's books, and I would tell you to read this, just to get closure from the whole Trevelyan tale. But man oh man, Kate and Trev raised a brat!!!!!! I expected way better. Sorry, Ms. Mckade..."
2,"Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
1,"It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
2,"Timeless, sublime, beautiful, otherworldly. Forget most of today's derivitive, mixing hip hop, copy cat, [stuff]. This is the real thing. Hassell was there on Terry Riley's original ""In C"" recording that changed music for all time. He's the first trumpeter with a new sound since Miles. He's deep into it, micro rhythms, polyphony, microtones, electronics everything. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE HIM. And this is arguably one of the best. Those who think Eno and his ilk invented alternative music should do a little more research, and find out who the real progenitors are."
1,"Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums. But haven't you all noticed you can play Wonderwall and Live Forever directly over all of these tracks? I give'em 2 for being consistent."
2,"I had never considered reading a vampire novel until I stumbled across ""Blood Games"" while searching for novels on ancient Rome. St. Germain's dangerous yet compellingly compassionate character completely drew me into the story and I've since been reading my way through the rest of his history. Ancient Rome's excesses and casual disregard for human life is sharply contrasted with the vampire's compassion and loyalty to the people around him. His essential ""humanity"" is shown most in his relationship to Olivia, the horrifically abused wife of the villian, who becomes one of the enduring loves of his life. If you've never before considered reading a vampire novel you'll change your mind once you've met St. Germain."
2,bought the book for my lil sister but couldnt help looking inside its got some pretty cool stuff
1,"I speak Chinese and naturally want to share that with my children. There were not many items out there when I began looking for DVDs, and this was featured (three or so years ago). This was a waste of money. It is not kid-friendly and doesn't even teach Chinese. Look for something else. This is as good as no DVD at all."
1,"This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
1,"I got the black stockings in size A/B. They are way off too short. Almost 1"" above my knees. I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs. Make sure you order at least one size up.I am also disappointed with the customer service. Shipping took exactly 2 weeks. I do not think I would like to order another thing from Essential Apparel."
2,"This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who ""just don't get it"" I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!"
1,"I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4. It lasted me about a year and a half. I opted for this Macally charger, for two reasons, 1. the price 2. the great reviews on Amazon. I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional. Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger, but it really comes out to the same price, considering that an apple charger costs about $90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $30 and lasts six months."
1,I purchased this tivo from amazon. After hooking everything up I plugged it in and it did not work. No lights or sounds at all. I called tivo's customer service line and they said it would need to be exchanged. I will now have to pay $20-25 for shipping plus packaging materials to send it back and then wait a few weeks for a new one.
2,"These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
1,Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
1,"The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting).[...]They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C. The caps don't fit perfectly (the original are 8mm diameter versus 12.5mm that I put in) so insulate the leads and let them float above the circuit board.DLC-810e, CLC-110e, DLC810e, CLC110e, Lukwerks Outdoor Camera, 961-00290, Wilife Outdoor Camera, Logitech Outdoor Camera"
2,"I just love the smallville series. Season 9 is so exciting. Zod,Lois's look into the future,Justice Society, new villians and heros. I couldn't stop watching and looking forward to season 10. Wish Smallville would go on forever."
2,I lost my original charger and bought this to replace it and it works just like the original. Very happy about this purchase!
2,For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America.
1,The picture quality sub VHS standard. I'm a fan of Terence Hill films but this was by far the worst I've seen. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"""Charles Manson in Nuell Emmons's Words"" anyone who's seen or heard Manson interviewed, knows his lingo and knows those aren't his words."
2,I don't know want the book is about yet Hahaha so can I read now? Thank you ? This is I don't know
1,Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.
2,"This is the second TiVo DVR I've owned. I really like the dual tuner feature. I prefer using the TiVo DVR to the DVRs my local cable company rents. One of my favorite features is that when you fast forward or rewind, this DVR compensates for that split second it takes from the time you recognize the end of a commercial and the time you release the fast forward feature. TiVo builds in a slight ""jump back"" feature, which the Comcast's DVRs don't have. I also like the TiVo Desktop software which I've installed onto my home computer. With my home network, I can transfer shows from the DVR to my computer's hard drive."
2,"I had no end of trouble getting it installed on my Vista computer. Tech Support was useless, apparently not admitting to the problem. I finally tried the forums and found a workaround. Finally working, the player is great for music and my Audiobooks, small, easy to use, generally just what I wanted."
2,"Great in-your-face hardcore here. Kind of a mix of old and new school. Two singers, two guitars, and the beats that wont let up. A lot of tempo changes. I WANT MOOOOOOORE!!!! keep the faith brothas."
1,"The price was nice but the performance is lacking. Our son can soak one of these full in a few hours and has more leaks with these. We don't dare use these overnight and just use them during the day (We use Huggies Snug & Dry Size 3 at night). Even during daytime use, he still will leak once in a while with these. It might be partly a sizing issue since these are larger than the equivalent 3 in the Huggies. We won't be getting these again after this pack runs out."
1,"I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources. And frankly, I think there's just nothing new here."
1,"but the seller (greenman19) took my money and I never received the item. Thus, I'm sure the movie is great, but I've still not seen it."
2,"Everyone could go round and round whether Clay Aiken's CD is worthy or not but it all comes down to ONE thing...we all have our own opinions on music and the types of music we choose to listen to. As for radio stations denying playing any of his songs....well, just one little tidbit to think about...there are some songs on the radio now that I could care less about hearing but they still have the chance to be aired on radio. So why shouldn't Clay's song? Little hint: If you don't like the song playing on the radio at the moment--flip it to something else. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Play fair!"
2,"I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I'd care to admit, but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time. It is startling how good these recordings are, and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings...the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them. In addition, these EMI recordings are an astonishing value. Buy and listen for yourself. I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making."
1,This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
2,"after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!"
1,"The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. I think this is kind of strange, considering one of the characters is going deaf."
2,"These jeans are comfortable to wear yet they are sturdy thick denim. I wear size 38 inch waist jeans and these ""Relaxed Fit"" fit well; but I would think the regular size 38 inch would be too small for me. These jeans feel good to wear. The fabric is broken in evenly; though still have new denim qualities. They are not loose or baggy on me; but fit well. They cover my knee caps in length. They feel well made. They have nice uniform stone wash hues."
2,"I gave this CD five stars because of Clays incredible voice. I will concede the fact that the production and the song choices could have been better. Nevertheless, Clays voice is so AMAZING that any shortfalls in the production and material is easily offset with Clays musical prowess. There are however, some excellent songs on this CD, such as The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man and Shine.DONT LISTEN TO THE CLAY HATERS THAT COME HERE ON AMAZON AND GIVE THIS CD ONLY ONE STAR! Those people are just haters of good music and they are trying to persuade you not to buy this CD. Also, granted some of the five star reviews may be from ""Claymates"" but that does not negate the fact that this CD is really good.BUY THIS CD! It is entertaining and fun. Isn't that why we all buy CD's, to be entertained?"
1,the movie was bad the kid ruined it yellign and being angry the whole time. And it was the same as the last 2 movies nothing out very boring ending was ok.
2,Outstanding history from Robert E. Lee's most important aide. Tremendously insightful into Lee and the ANVA
2,"This coffee warmer is great. It does what it should. Keeps my coffee or tea at a great drinking temp, although it can tend to be too hot for me as I drink it slowly and with the beverage sitting on the warmer so long it will get hotter. I still love it as I enjoy having warm to hot beverage beside me when watching TV or reading."
2,"I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
1,"This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself."
2,"We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand."
2,"Not since Johnathan Livingston Seagull have we had a book that speaks to the power and beauty of a small bird. Iridescent Soul's main character is the hummingbird, but its message is for the human soul.It is beautiful, light, transcendent, and hopeful. A great gift!"
2,"The guy who said this isn't HDTV is very, VERY wrong. This is an HDTV, but it doesn't have the tuner built inside of it. It supports HDTV, but you need a tuner in order to get it. This is an excellent piece of equipment for playing the xbox 360 on, although it definately has backlight leaking on the top and bottom. As said before, VERY bright screen and I also run it at 50%. Besides the backlight leak, it is an excellent HDTV/monitor and plays games well with NO ghosting. BUY IT!!"
2,I read this back in the mid-70s when I was 12 or 13 and it had just come out in paperback. I thoroughly enjoyed it then and again a bazillion years after I first read it.
2,"Besides being a very talented vocalist, Clay Aiken shows he is versatile and in-tune with today's music. This easy-on-the-ears music will make you get up and dance or reminisce with a smile on your face. I can honestly say there isn't a song I do not like, and this artist will be around for a long time to come."
1,"The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad. Pretty costumes, pretty direction, a nifty techno soundtrack, and Robert Carlyle make watching Plunkett & McLeane worthwhile only if you're in the mood for a ninety-minute music video. Brainless fun."
2,"Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely ""The Descent 2,"" will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!"
2,"Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out."
2,"These are only meant for use as temporary or guest bedding, but I've been in a situation where I am using this item daily as my bed for over a month now. I am a large person. It has held up beautifully. I add air maybe once every 7-10 days. The flocked top is great, holding sheets in place. It is so comfortable, my back and general body pain has improved dramatically since using it! I suspect that when my permanent bed arrives, this little bed will serve long and well as guest bedding."
1,"Oasis dogged it on this album.... Be Here Now and Dya Know What I Mean are the only 2 songs on here that don't drive you mad. It's still a fun album to own for like a month, but after that it will collect dust. I don't know what it is about Oasis, but their songs just tire very easily, unlike the songs of say, U2. Anyway I'm sure the next album will be great again. Yeah Yeah Yeah."
1,purchased two of these. one unit worked good for about an hour the static electricity made it go up in flames. the second unit will only produce sound from the left or right channel at different levels. it will not balance out even with the balance nob.
2,"This book is a wonderfully written true tale of the disaster of the whaleship Essex. This crew of Nantucketers and off-islanders endured the most horrible adventure at sea. An enourmous Sperm Whale rams the boat and sends these men into a 90-day whirlwind of starvation, dehydration, delusion, despair, insanity, death, and eventual recovery. The way Nathaniel Philbrick depicts every aspect of their hellish journey puts you at the helm. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know what REALLY happened to the crew of the whaleship Essex back in the early 19th century, and how Melville was inspired to write his famous novel ""Moby Dick""."
1,"This Tivo series2 Dual Tuner has limited surround sound capabilities. If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box, chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device.I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo, with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor, similar to my VCR and TV. My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound. The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal.I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround. However, on TiVo's own website in the customer forum, I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround.This appears to be a design flaw."
1,This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
1,I enjoyed this book mainly because it is a Historical fiction novel. I think this book would be a good reading source for anyone between the ages of 11-13 because it has alot to teach about life in the 1800's while letting you read a facinating story about a girl and the troubles she goes through after she moves away from her home in Barbados to her uncles home in New England. I think the auther needs some more detail in her writting as to create a more vivid picture of the senery. I think that it would be wonderful if this story could have a sequel to it because like all books it cuts of into ablivion.
2,"I originally bout a netgear adapter because it was a little cheaper than the Tivo adapter. I had nothing but problems with the netgear. Poor signal strength (33% or less) and frequent lost connections (a few times per week on avg). I put up with it for about a year or so before deciding to try the Tivo adapter. I read some good reviews, but was still skeptical. Not any more. It worked great right out of the box, much stronger signal (90%) and after nearly one month, it hasn't lost it's network connection even once! This was definitely the way to go."
2,This shoe tree holds enough shoes to get the shoes off of the floor and on to a convenient carousel. The construction is sturdy & was easy to assemble.
1,"I generally like Nick Cage even in his bad movies. This bad movie leaves very little to like about Nick or Herzog. Poor plot development is left to be interpreted by the visual arts and the script is even worse. Say whatever the other reviewers want, but I hated this movie."
1,"Decided to try these as a cheaper alternative to Earths Best diapers. Since I read they don't have Drymax, I thought it would be okay to use. Within the first day of use, my child started getting a reddish rash. It went away as soon as we stopped using these. My feeling is that it is due to the blue colored absorbent material and/or the scent. I did not realize the diapers had a scent, since I was used to the EB diapers."
1,"My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We ""looked inside this book"" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great effects, very good plot line... well worth the money and a good change from the previous Batman titles (which, I thought were very good -- hey, it's from a COMIC BOOK)!"
1,"The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. The only problem I've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo. If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management. The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it wouldn't happen again. Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try. I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue."
2,"Now I can see her today and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
2,This was a pretty effective exercise video. The routines on this video are realistic to follow.
1,"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."
2,I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical.
1,Little Disapointed seems to be old material from all his other videos Just an older Billy on stage
1,"If I have to rate this book, I would rate it below 1 star. This is complte waste of money and I would suggest DON'T waste your money on this. If you really want to buy book on Struts, go for the one which O'Reilley has. Apart from numberous errors, this book doesn't cover anything new other then just basic and that too is not worth reading it."
2,recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color. could be little cheaper
2,"This is one of the few Christmas specials that is still aired every year and is one that drove my mom crazy when I was young because she found Charlie Brown to be annoying. After forty-seven-years since it debuted, it still receives millions of viewers. It is one of the few cartoons that gives kids the real meaning of Christmas."
1,This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.
2,"The author paints a story of two unlikely friends, Lenny who is very much like a child but huge and as strong as a bare and often runs into trouble with out knowing it. Bad tempered but somewhat kind George has to get Lenny out of trouble sometimes losing his job. They both share a dream together of having their own farm and just when it seems close to coming true things go absolutely wrong. I read this book and it left me breathless at the end and touched me deeply because of how it reflected the harsh times then and now and of how society deals with different minded people. The writing is beautiful filled with heavy metaphors. I think if you've read John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" you should read this too, or if you are interested in something heavy and thought provoking or if you want to read a good book that's bin banned before :)"
2,"This is a very nice looking case. The PDA fits snugly and doesnt slide around. The latch on my case seems very secure and takes some effort to open. As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases. I dont rely on them.The main thing I dislike about this case is that it opens to the left, not the right like other cases Im used to. A minor thing that I can get used to."
1,"The case looks really nice and seems well made. But I never used it because the case seems backward for my TX. While the TX fits well into it, I can't access the stylus or the ports for synching and charging. If I put it in backwards the stylus and ports are accessible but I can't see the screen when I open it."
2,I needed this wireless adaptor because I don't have two cable outlets close enough together to reach an ethernet cable from my wireless router to my TV and cable splitters ruin my Internet connection. It did not disappoint. Once I hooked it up to my new Tivo I began running through the setup screens. The adapter easily found my network SID. The screen to enter the security key was simple to use. It quickly connected to my network with the WPA2 security after I entered my key. I was impressed how quickly it was able to download the settings and initial programming to make the Tivo and my TV usable. This is a great product and well worth the price!
1,"I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."
1,"Please let it be known that this is a 1973 recording. The CD is so hard to hear that our 2009 CD players are even left confused. The recording is poor compared to today's standards and IT'S ONLY ABOUT 20 MINUTES LONG.Sure, the information is great but I want to know more. When the CD was over I felt cheated. Almost like I got an advertising piece that gives you a teaser of what the book is about so you can buy it.Please understand, this has nothing to do with the option method which sounds great and I wish to know more about. The review is for the CD itself which is a complete waste of money."
1,"I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years."
2,"A great little product at a friendly price. I got this as a gift and couldn't be more pleased. Only draws 17 watts, about the same as a medium-sized CFL lamp. One caution: the warming surface gets hot -- as it's supposed to -- so keep it away from small children and be careful yourself. This product should not be used with plastic or double-walled insulated cups or mugs. Works fine with any ceramic cup -- anything ceramic or glass that's microwave safe is OK.Update a month later: One of the three units we purchased failed and has been returned to Amazon for replacement. Stay tuned and I'll update this review further if we have any more problems."
2,Amazon makes it easy to find obscure releases from lesser known artists. The one-click shopping is easy to use. The item was shipped and received very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.
2,"At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like ""doublethink"" and ""newspeak"". And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."
2,This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd's that are not english. All of the songs on it are great. I am not new to this form of music anymore so if you are new to this form of music and are a Sailor Moon fan like me. This would be a very good buy. ;}
1,"this book expects you to be an expert at drawing, painting, photoshop.It gives some advice but is really only good for inspiration for someone experiencedI was actually trying to learn how to paint(had some basics down), and this was no use for me.The artist did most of the work in photoshop, and didn't really do a good job explaining how to get the results.Now that I have faster internet, I youtube whenever I want to learn something new. (Painting, Guitar, Fixing anything)"
2,"This is an all-new edition, following the 2002 hbk, but Fantagraphics don't flaunt the fact. Why not? The hbk's long sold out and they could sell this all over again to nerds like me. Seriously (OK, I was serious), the hbk's heaven (snap 'em up, fellas, while you can) and this is bliss, apart from the curious (and curiously irritating) typography chosen for the headwords. Trina Robbins went, or was pushed, down the same route when A Century of.. morphed into The Great Women Cartoonists - the Women and the Comics original I've not seen - but we're not talking wacky here, fellas, this is serious art! Well, OK, fun art. Thanks a million, Gary (Groth)"
2,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is about a girl, named Francie Nolan growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 1900's. Her family, which consists of her younger brother Neeley, her father Johnny, and her mother Katie, struggles to make ends meat. Katie ends up being responsible for keeping the family running because Johnny, is an alcoholic and they can't depend on him for survival. The Nolan's are faced with many problems and hardships, but they are strong and always manage to get through them. Life starts to look up for the Nolan's just as they thought all of their dreams would never come true. This is an easy book to get into because it is very discriptive. You feel as if you're a part of the book and that you're living with Francie in the slums of Brooklyn about ninety years ago. This book is a great experience for all who read it."
1,The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying. I would look else where for a piano DVD.
1,"mayne how can yawll listen to diz man? nelly is one of da weakest/wackest nikkaz in da game period. i'm not gone lie grillz was str8 only because paul wall and big gipp was in it but otha than that nelly is a ""TRL"" rapper and needs to retire"
1,this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner
2,"You must buy this film, It is one of the best horror films that Ive seen in the last couple of years...Stanley & Simon are brothers & well they like to hunt & kill ......"
1,"The whole point in ordering a genuine retail packaged Canon battery is to avoid cheap Chinese knockoffs. Unfortunately, I ordered two of this product and received just that. Make sure what you receive is a genuine Canon product in retail packaging with hologram. Even then, it's possible that the packaging + hologram has been spoofed.Needed these batteries for a trip to Africa, leaving tomorrow. Beware seller Savings 365"
1,"Well I can't say that this was the best book I read. It was definately a fine book. Fine being Ok not good but not horrible. It was an easy read with nothing to miss seeing as Gibbons pushes everything down your throat. Not much thinking needed for this one. I would have liked to see more of what a child sees in a mother. Not what a commercial says one should be. If the book had gone into more depth and actualy painted the characters with lives outside of Hattie's I might have found it more interesting. For a mediocre read about woman who goes from insane woman with passions to a Stepford Wife whom Jesse Helms himself would be proud of, pick this book up. If it doesn't sound good your money is better put to laundry or a good CD."
1,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone."
1,"After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking."
2,"This tale is a bit far-fetched, but I enjoyed it very much. Suzanne Enoch writes with much humor and charm!"
1,"It is an intersting concept, however, when you play your iPod through the toy, when you play relatively quiet music, it will burp and fart, implying it is ""bored"".This is a drawback for parents needing to teach their children polite behavior.I found it obnoxious."
2,"I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
1,"Much too long, excruciatingly boring and all Shia LaBeouf does is scream for over 2 hours. I made the horrible mistake of actually BUYING this movie."
2,"This one was the first Veggie Tales video I ever saw, and I think it's still my favorite! The Jurassic Park allusion is hilarious. Intelligent, funny, witty, not just for kids but adults too."
1,"After watching this video, I fell on Beginners trails. I also almost died getting on and off the lift. I should sue the producer."
2,"Good quality and does its job. Unlike some others, my ball doesn't seem to leak air. I have had it for almost a year and the amount of air inside it is relatively the same as I put in. Its also a little better quality than the stability balls in my gym. All in all, a good product."
2,"I bought the book for college and it has served it's purpose. It is a good book. There is quite a bit of writing in it and some of the pages are bent and wrinkly, but it was a good buy."
1,"Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third. Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen. Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree."
2,"Maggie Smiths is phenomenal! Her portrayal of the lonely spinster Judith Hearne is impeccable. The scene where she drinks alone is really heartbreaking. Bob Hoskins is equally good as James Madden who broke her heart due to mutual misunderstanding. In fact, there is no bad acting in this movie. I, however, have conflicting feelings about the concluding scenes (Madden visiting Hearne at the hospital) which are not in the novel. These might be the only scenes showing clearly Madden's lonliness and really draw a balance between the two main characters. But the character of Madden is made a little too desperate for money here and somewhat contradictory to how he behaves in the rest of the movie."
1,This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing.
2,Even though not an original book(it is a photocopy) of the book. It is readable and am glas I could still find it.
2,"When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon."
1,"I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it."
1,I emailed the company 3 times requesting permission to return unused item and they never got back to me. I am stuck with a product I do not want that I bought by mistake. Bad business.
1,"This is ridiculously preachy stuff. I can tolerate a bit of leftiness in my folk, I find the sincerity touching, but this is too over the top to listen to all the way through more than once."
1,"Oh woe, here we go with xenophobia. Evil, satantic Japanese baddies seek to take over Robocop's home city with the help of some rather melodramatic and frankly tedious robotic ninjas.The first Robocop was an excellent and moving film. By now the series has lost all its magic and vitality and is no more than people fighting. Somebody seems to have had the idea of making this one for younger viewers, so it's all very tame compared to its predecessors and relies heavily on flashbacks to the first (and superior) film.Uninspiring, dull and overblown. Don't bother with this film. You'll only encourage them to make a Part 4 and drag the character of Robocop down to even greater depths."
2,"I got this album long ago and have never regretted it. It IS my Christmas album (vinyl) that I use throughout the season. The perfect, blended harmonies of the Mills Brothers, the retro arrangements, the classic Christmas tunes, done with such mellow aplomb always amplify my Christmas mood. It oozes class. I would recommend it to anyone wishing a good, Christmas album, but especially to those audiophiles who appreciate the feel for going back a little in time, to our younger years and reminiscing about Christmases past and the good ol' days."
2,"We just got this for our 2 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 year old. They love it. The 2 year old is a little scared but he will play sometimes and he really likes to watch. The 4 year old loves it, especially if you make your reaction to the gater bites dramatic."
2,"We are about half way through and a majority of members have expressed they like the book. We are using this in conjunction with the study guide. We choose a few key study guide questions to discuss each week.The content is great, the use of scripture to support is pretty good, and the message is clear and pertinent."
2,"Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
1,I bought many times pampers but this product seems to me particular bad. The pad in the middle is so thin that doesn't hold much urine. Stay away from this one!
2,"I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don't say ""wherefore"" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read."
1,"I was vastly disappointed with this novel. I had read and admired ""Ellen Foster"" and was optimistic when ""Charms"" was selected by my book club. Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely ""human"" qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."
2,"Just purchased this product and was totally amazed!!! I have tried so many differect concealer products and was disappointed each time with their efficacy. The first time I used ColorBlend, I knew I'd finally found what I have been searching for. It conceals so well, and looks so natural. Thank you ColorBlend."
1,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
1,"I can`t tell you how disappointed i was when i bought this album back in 1982. Since then the musical landscape has changed a bit but it`s still pretty bad in my opinion . Worst tunes are Staying power, action this day, Body language. Some songs are quite agreeable like Back Chat (sounds a bit like Diana Ross`s ""upside down"")""Las Palabras"" is a nice ballad Under Pressure is still a great number which was originally written for the Greatest Hits album(1981) and therefore it sounds like a stranger on this record."
2,"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life, is very interesting and informative. It was definitely worth the time and the effort reading and working on it. Audiences of all backrounds should benefit from the information, including those of who lived during that time period. Many younger generation kids are oblivious to what actually happened during the Vietnam War, and should be educated about the historical importance of the war. The book itself helped the audience, especially those of who are of Vietnamese decent, understand how their ancestors survived and what they went through during the course of the war."
1,"I need nutrients as well as calories, protein, carbs, sodium, fiber, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and %fat calories. This book does not cover nutrients."
1,"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."
1,"We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
2,"Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
2,i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all..
1,this CD blows. tubthumbing was cool at first and then it got old real fast. the rest of the songs blow. I am so sick of this CD if anyone wants to buy it from me... wait I'll pay you to take it. I think they need to have a 0 rating instead of 1. don't buy this CD
2,Finally this thing has been enhanced for surround. It is about GD time!!! Lacks one star because Road Warrior takes it one step to the next level of high intensity. Interceptor motor kicks butt on the old surround sound rear channels too!
2,"I THOUGHT SHE STARTED OUT KIND OF SLOW. HOWEVER, CAMIKA DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING YOUR MIND TURNING AS YOU READ THE NOVEL. YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND YOU KEEP READING TO TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN. I WAS ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I WAS STILL SURPRISED AT THE END. THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS WILL MAKE YOU SPEED READ IT'S SO GOOD. SHE DID A GOOD JOB OF TOUCHING ON AN ISSUE MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IS OUT THERE. I'LL DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT NOVEL."
2,"This was similar to the first volume. Now however, the TA's have fought in real battle and there has been more action than the first volume- slowly things are coming together. Volume 3 is when you'll decide if you like the series or not though- There is a lot more action and more character development than the first 2 volumes. Although Volumes 1 and 2 seem slow, it is important for a basis for the rest of the series so bear through it! Again, I recommend you rent the first 3 volumes before buying them to decided whether or not you'll like the series. I really enjoyed this series and it took the first 3 volumes to figure that out."
1,"I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and ""gotta be there"". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again."
1,"Nowhere near the intrigue and plot of the original Foundation Trilogy. Foundation & Earth was an irritating series of hypothetical debates that amounted (usually) to nothing, and a series of trite, rather meaningless visits to far off planets. The ending (I won't spoil it) was hard to believe, to put it mildly. I give Asimov credit for some of the greatest sci-fi around, but he should have retired from the game after the 1950's."
2,My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)
2,This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
1,"They are sold out but made a loooooong album..... Has anybody listened to the full CD without pulling the ""stop""buttom of your CD player???"
2,Once of the best appliances we have ever owned. The rice comes out perfect every time!
2,This book was very interesting. The way Steinbeck portrays Lennie and George just sets the mood. Giving Lennie his tremendous size and childish brain and having George as a tiny man with big ideas makes every situation they get into a bigger challenge. Their slured speech and stupidness is a key to this thilling novella. I feel this book is however for an older audience because of the foul language and the way George treats Lennie who has a mental problem.
1,"After the baby mulilations I couldn't read any more. I am still haunted by the images from that, as the mother of three young sons it was too disturbing for me. Definitely will not purchase any more books from this author. I couldn't donate this one to our libary's book sale fast enough!"
2,"I could easily have made this tool, but I'm getting lazy in my old age. It beats using a pair of channel locks, and much neater."
1,"This video is fine if you are looking for help with form and stretching exercises. I was hoping for more about the ""chi"" of running, and ""chi"" in general. I love the bits I have read about Chi Running, but I wish this was a video of the material in the book. Then maybe I wouldn't feel guilty when I see the book on my shelf (mostly) unread. I'm hoping there will be an audio version in the future."
1,"I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
2,"This book was written in 1923, and I have an original copy I bought online from some book site.It is worth the read, and it has some history to it. (Names, old addresses, etc.) but because of it being in the early 20th century, the information might be outdated.A good classical read on the subject none of the less."
1,"I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains."
1,"Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (""2001"" or ""2010"") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."
1,"I was quite unhappy to know that this wasn't a ""Collection"" of shows, but more of a ""The making of"" series. There were only a few episodes on it, and the rest of it was a disappointment by a long shot! If you are looking for watching actual Three Stooges, DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,"Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition ""Technical Analysis 98"", this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1,"has some scratches , the box looks good , but a bad feed back , It doesnt play in the DVD"
2,"If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases."
1,"C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about ""cutting off"" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."
2,People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think
1,"When written, this books topic was well known. Individuals and styles of communication were well understood.With time, the people and places Con Price refers to are only familiar to a few local individuals-and only important in regards to this fund of knowledge.I am currently working with Dr. William Thackery of MSU-Northern, Havre, Montana to upgrade and update the book and subscript the text for improved reading, relevance, and accuracy. Once done this text may be a leading contribution to the history of Montana and Southern Alberta.Yours,Ruth M. Burleigh P.O.Box 608 Chinook, Montana 59523 (406)357-4255"
1,"I thought this would be full of wit and wisdom along with salicous bits of gossip. Nope. An old man (venerable as he was) trying to remember. However, If I could read in the 18th century, this probably would be a best seller."
1,"There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either."
2,When somthing is worthy of remembering bought and shared with my kids. These kind of books will always be a gift for all their lives.
1,"You know those classic slap-stick ""Three Stooges"" shorts that are always on TV? Well forget those because only 4 of their 220 short-films made it into these 7 discs. Those 4 being the public domain shorts that have been released time and time again. The rest of this set is comprised of the team's early work with Ted Healy (which was before the Stooges even developed their act), some late ""Curly Joe"" material and cartoons. Fans who see this impressive looking box-set will be puzzled and disappointed by the lack of what the packaging promises. It is very deceptive."
1,"Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."
1,I did not like this item or how it worked. I guess it just isn't whatI wanted. It did not work like I thought it would. Attachment would notfit snuggly into vacuum hose. Was hard to insert between blinds and did notclean as well as I wanted. They were really dirty but I ended up using anotherproduct.
1,"The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book ""core java 2"" is much better."
1,"the description stated that this item was: Headband's metal plate size is 6""L x 2""H and that it was an Official Naruto headband. what i received was not what was pictured or described. i measured the metal plate and it came to 4""L x 1.5""H and definitely did not match my other official Naruto headband that i do have. I was hoping to use this for a cosplay that is coming up very soon but i cant now because the item is not what was pictured or described, so now i have to go through the difficulty of finding another one and hoping that its the real thing and not a bootleg like this one. i will not be buying from this seller again. i also recommend to all of you that see this and think its a good deal to just stay away and not buy this bootlegged fake."
2,"I have liked this product so much that I have three of them...I fill a glass container with some smell good pine sol AND my whole home/work place is filled with the scent of clean (we have cats and no one is the wiser as they can not be smelled at all).I am thinking of ordering another one of these in a few weeks, thanks for asking!Paula Jo Carr"
1,"Keep getting ""Driver Open Fail"" message. No solution availabe, this renders the camera unusable. Save your money."
1,"For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on ""Speak & Spell""). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."
2,"As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun."
1,"This product is fantastic for those whose climate never varies by more than one degree. When I saw the name ""Timex"" I was somewhat apprehensive but said to myself, ""How can they mess up a thermometer?"". I don't know how they did it but they did, big time. Admittedly, for $5.99 I didn't expect a device approved by the National Weather Service but this product is overpriced by about $5.98. Rather than going through the hassle of returning it I joyously took a hammer to it and took out many inner frustrations. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."
2,"This is a sad and thoughtful album, indeed, and Amy writes one of the saddest songs on this album (Missing you). Many of the songs are about unrequited love, marriage, and hardships in life. This album def. reflects Amy's feelings on her marriage to Gary Chapman, and her love for Vince Gill. It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer. Buy it if you like Amy's previous pop albums, or if you like sad songs (Which I do!)Choice tracks:Nobody homeCry a river,Leave it all behind,Missing you,The feeling that I had,Somewhere down the road."
2,"I thought Kathy Reich's first book ""Deja Dead"" was a quick, fun read, but a little sloppy. Given that the killer kept changing the method by which he killed, it was a wonder that Tempe Brennan actually solved the crime. (Aren't serial killers supposed to be consistant?) Anyway, the atmosphere was good and I'm a sucker for anything about Montreal. Which leads me to ""Death du Jour."" What a surprise to find Ms. Reich in such firm command of the genre in just her second book. She juggles several (try five) different story lines so successfully, you would think this was fifth or sixth in the series. Brava! I dare you to put this one down."
1,"After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one."
2,"I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."
1,"Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview. Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the ""Previous"" button pressed in ""hold"" mode while connecting the cable to laptop."
2,"I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother."
2,"Sights Unseen is a moving story about a young girl who has a mother who is mentally ill, and by all accounts, unable to have a real relationship with her daughter. The yearning for the closeness young Hattie wanted with her mother, Maggie, is only too heartbreaking. This book not only shows how hard it is for Hattie to deal with her mother's emotional dips, but for her brother, Freddy, as well as her father. Pearl, the loving housekeeper, sometimes seemed to be the life preserver that kept the family afloat. She's a likable character, and it's too bad you don't know more about her. The only complaint I have about the book, or Kaye Gibbons as an author in particular, is the fact that there is not more dialoge in the book. The story is there, but there should be more interaction and depth between the characters."
2,"Measure of a Man is one of those rare CDs where every single song is worth listening to! A mix of uptempo pop and ballads, this CD provides a range of styles to showcase Clay Aiken's amazing talents and prove once and for all, that he is a true pop superstar.I'll be listening to this one until my player wears out!"
2,I use to purchase my diapers from walmart....but not now. I love the FREE two day shipping and you only pay a few more dollars for alot more diapers. I will never purchase diapers from walmart or any other store but amazon.
2,"OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.TO THE ONES THAT HAVE MS.FEEHAN'S OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION, TO HER FINE WORK.TO THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES .THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MS.FEEHAN WORK.NICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFUL,THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END,ONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDE.A KEEPER .....4 STARS"
2,"An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible ""players"". Don't try this one at home!"
2,"I could not put this book down. I almost ended up in divorce court because I spent all my time reading the book and not paying attention to my husband. When you think you knew who it could be, it wasn't that person until the end. This is an excellent book and take it from someone who hates reading, you will not be able to put it down. You may want to take a couple of days off work to read it."
2,"Stargate: Continuum is a good movie that brings together all of the SG-1 characters again... This is a funny & poignant movie, full of some surprises, that creates a dramatic to way to more or less tie up some loose ends when the series ended. I enjoyed it."
2,"Easy to read yet scholarly. Great illustrations. Space in the margins for notes. Good chapter overviews and summaries. Nice T/F questions to prime the reader. Sources used appropriately. It is truly the ideal textbook.The format, layout, and writing style make this the text that other writers should follow."
1,"We use a different variety of Pampers diapers on monthly delivery. We were running short and bought a box of these ""Baby Dry."" For some reason, they do not work at all. They leak through the legs."
2,"I looked far and wide for a medium to light brown eyeliner pencil and this one turned out to be perfect. If you have blonde hair, you can look a little trashy wearing black eyeliner, so this is a wonderful find."
1,"Why doesn't someone write an adult book about Matt Henson? I went looking for a biography of him and all I could find was children's books, and this one, which is apparently supposed to be an adult book, but is written on about a junior-high level. It seems like one of America's greatest black heroes should have had an adult biography written about him by now!"
2,"I just finished this book. Great story, great humor and all around great reading. I highly recommend it."
2,I have subscribed this item and receive it every month. It works for my baby. The quantities are great that makes it very cheap to afford compared to what you get when you buy them in stores. I did lot of research and this is the cheapest place to buy diapers. The quality of the diapers is also good. I will continue to buy them from Amazon as long as I need them.
1,It is impossible to tighten this product easily. You should have four hands to be able to tighten it symetricaly.
1,"I tested this product out on 3 different cats. I guess the aroma appealed to them because they tried to eat it, but not one of them was able to The pieces are just too large. I think they are too hard as well."
1,"My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
1,"The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
2,"I love this movie!To see Jerry in a dress is always funny.Skinny and hairy!What a riot!!!He's a very handsome man,but he makes a funny looking laaaaaadddddyyyyyy!!!It's worth watching."
2,Last week I recive the Pie and Pastry Bible and I've already try out three recipes with good result. The children absolutly loves the Peanutbutter mousse pie and me and my husband hacve the pear and ginger cake as a new favourite.
2,"We ordered from Airsplat via Amazon on January 19th. My son wanted the gun for his birthday party. So, I pai the extra $8.99 for the ""expedited shipping"" cost for 1-3 business day delivery. It didn't happen. The gun arrived 7 days LATER! Our Amazon receipt even siad estimated date was January 20-21st. Big disappointment on the ""not-so"" speedy delivery from Airsplat!"
1,"This movie sucks big time. It was so boring, dull, unfunny and a piece of garbage. Please do not waste your precious time or waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie makes Mariah Carey's glitter and wisegirls looks like a masterpiece. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand how cher got an oscar when Glenn Close was nominated for fatal attraction. Again I repeat, THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, IT MADE ME SICK. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MOVIE. STUPID CRAP. DON'T SEE IT. VERY VERY BORING."
1,"This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning."
2,"This, too, was one of several pair of sleep pants for my son's Christmas stuff. He's NUTS about them. They make him want to make a running start to jump & slide on the bed! MORE PLEASE!! Possible to get them in a plaid?"
2,"I have the most stubborn plantars wart and after about 2.5 months of applying this every night, my wart has finally gone away. It doesn't hurt at all, as the acid just kills the upper layers of the skin cells. I would recommend taking a shower or at least getting the wart moist with a washcloth so that the medication works the best. I left it on over night and just applied it with a Q-tip with the end cut off, then covering with a bandage. Killing some of the surround skin was a huge concern, because in my opinion, the skin on your foot is thick enough to withstand it. While I don't know if I would recommend it for everyone, I used a cuticle clipper to cut away the dead layers of the wart so that the medication would be able to kill the wart faster. When I didn't, the skin wouldn't peel off like it would for some of the other reviews, and it worked fine."
2,"Un clasico, muy bien editado. Un precio muy bueno, para la calidad de su contenido. Para quien no conoce a Barthes, esta seria una buena introduccin a su trabajo."
2,The DVD has one of the best director's and actor's comments I have ever seen on a DVD.McLellan's performance is beyond positive description (did I spell his name right?).
2,"My son has worn these since moving out of the infant diapers and we see no need to change. Amazingly good at stopping leaks and few diaper rashes.Very reasonable price with the subscribe and save / Mom discount on Amazon, normally ~30% off retail. If I had to pay regular store prices I may have been tempted to try a bargain brand but with the discount its worth it going with the name brand quality."
1,"The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place."
2,This tape has a great feel to it. Ridden a couple hundred miles on it and they look as great as the day I installed. Super comfortable with or without gloves on. Definitely recommend.
1,"I liked pamper baby dry size 4. So I tried size 5 and expected it to last long. However, the size 5 one is so much thinner than size 4."
2,"For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"
2,"Incredible as it may sound ""Investing for Dummies"" was a realpage-turner! I read the entire book in several hours andactually gained some useful investing information. I have sincebeen able to make money in the three weeks since readingthe book. The recommended ""Dummies Approved"" lists are a greatresource. They act as good starting points for the novice toresearch investing ideas."
2,"I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. I tried two different USB devices and three different PCI devices and none of them worked until this product. What a great price too. I put it in loaded the software and BAM! it work perfectly. Very cool how some thing just work and for about one third the price of all those other devices that I tried. My only complaint would be the 18"" external antenna. I wish it was one of the folding ones that comes attached. Oh well.... I'm just happy to be finished and not have to return any more stuff because it doesn't work."
2,"Lets face it. The music industry would have NEVER discovered this young man. Gangly, southern, loves his mother... But he truly IS a pop star. This album proves it. The songs sound a tad bit over-produced and there really isn't an original 'feel' to this CD, but for some reason, my wife and I can't seem to get enough of it. We think because the CD underscores and carries the sincerity that shone through during his metamorphosis on American Idol. He's the long-shot that won (albeit second, he far outshines the rest). And this album is a winner of sorts. We'll buy his next one so we can continue to enjoy watching him grow and change as an artist. Just like he did on TV."
1,"If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse movie, look no further. You've found it.One word: Feh!In NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(2.7) Night Train to Terror (1985) - Richard Moll/Cameron Mitchell/John Phillip Law/Marc Lawrence/Ferdy Mayne/Tony Giorgio/Earl Washington/Gabriel Whitehouse"
1,"I have two other cup warmers, but this was to be my third. It does EXACTLY what it claims to do: it is a cup WARMER. So, if you enjoy picking up a cup of WARM coffee -- you know -- like SPIT, 99 degress in your 98.6 degree mouth, well, good news, boppers, this is the cup warmer for you!"
1,"Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie. Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists. The acting is dreadful. The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman. As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard. And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents? There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne. She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film. Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized. Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio."
2,"A real super hero movie, real man with no super powers!!! Great beginning to an amazing trilogy!! Swear to me!!!"
2,"If you are a fan of public television, you are going to love this combo! Every title was entertaining, without all the rude sex and violence found in so many of today's box office blockbusters. Delightful and humorous features for only pennies, in your own living room."
2,"After shopping around and looking at recommended ""Thule"" and ""Yakima"" bike racks, I""m very happy to have purchased this ""Saris"" Bones 3 bike rack for so much less.Traveled over 50 miles at highway speed with no problems. Amazon offered the best price...local retail stores wanted 60 bucks more!"
2,This pack comes with a wide variety of products. It is a great introduction to the Komenuka line. I really enjoyed how clean my skin felt after using the cleanser. The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy. I would recommend this line to anyone.
1,"Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious."
2,"it arrived extremely late, to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed. Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate."
2,I was not sure if this product would really work. After using this product for a little over a week it is incredible. It does everything it says and I will be purchasing all the scents very soon!
1,There isn't anything new to be found in this text that hasn't been covered more thoroughly in other texts. The topics covered seemed glossed over without any meat or substance. Skip this one for more up to date books.
1,"My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
2,"This book is not bad, but it needs a little more work. She has a good start on her characters, but they need a little more work so that they have more depth or something as they seem a little superficial. Maybe it is because I have read and enjoyed so many of Patricia Cornwell's books and, as they are both about a woman who is in forensics or pathology, I unconsciously compare them and I shouldn't because they are very different heroines.The book is about a woman who splits her time between Canada and North Carolina who examines dead bodies. A lot of the story has been told by the other reviewers so I won't go into too much detail except to say that she looks into the death of a century old woman that nuns want to make into a saint and many mysterious deaths that are extremely gory. It keeps you on your toes and is packed full of murder and hayhem."
2,WE is a great novel that simply expalines the chain of change and the non-existance of the perfect system. Ans so the need of revolution I think reading this book is a must for s/f lovers
1,"You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century."
1,"I am a history lover and was excited to read this autobiography by Ben Franklin. I found it to be a great disappointment, since Franklin's writing ability did not shine in this book. He gave lots of details about trivial (and at times boring)circumstances and events, yet gave no information about other things of great interest to me -- for example his wife and family life and the entire American Revolution. The book suddenly ends, as if the author was tired of the project, and simply closed up shop."
1,"This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!"
2,"the movie was all right, wouldn't pay anymore than i did for it, overall it was entertaing, for simple minds"
2,"My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting."
1,"So, I am satisfied this is a good product based on the reviews here. However, I am not seeing any additional sensors. At first I was thinking it came with six sensors based on the name of the product. I suppose this is not so. You get only one sensor. Finally found additional sensors on another web site at $60 each. So, do the math. To fully utilize this device I need to spend another $300 for sensors. That makes a total price of $437. Guess I will keep looking!"
1,"What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
2,"Pretty good gun case. I use it to hold 2 handguns and a kel-tec sub 2000(small rifle that folds in half). I can put all the guns on the top level then all the magazines and other items on the bottom level. Case closes tight and nothing moves around. The only bad is that the locks are useless, the key dose not fit well and it is hard to lock/unlock. I have just stopped using the lock, which would be a problem around children."
2,"Wish I have a MAD MAX 2 DVD like this!! This is a great DVD, with the 2 versions on it!! the American dubbed version is a great wild cartooned movie. And when I hear the true Australian version... the movie becomes more serious and real!! amazing. Some of my friends prefered the old dubbed version, but I prefered the 2 versions!! The Stereo sound of the engine of the yellow interceptor when Max is waiting for the knight Rider is superb. The image is the best, and this DVD have the choice to see the movie in 16:9 or in a 4:3, wish all DVDs have this option when movies are filmed in wide screen. If you like Muscle Cars crashing, runing, etc. you must see this..."
2,"I got this for my mom for mother's day because she has a gorgeous garden. She opted to put it on the deck so she can hear the water when they hang out under their canopy thing. From what I understand about a lot of solar panels is that they should be able to store up some energy; the only major disappointment I came across is that whenever the panel is even half way in the shade, the fountain stops running. When the sun is shinning bright, it trickles away.So if you're planning on using this outside, be prepared for an on again, off again fountain unless you have sun all the time. Mind you, I didn't expect it to work all night; but I did think if it got cloudy for 5 or 10 minutes, it would work throught it.But overall, my mom loves it and everyone that's seen it, adores it."
2,"I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie."
1,"I've read every book in the series as well as the H. MacBeth series.I haven't finished this title yet but agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of proofreading. I was even stymied as to why this book would be listed under ""Women-detectives-England-NORFOLK and not Glous. or Warwickshire.""A.R. and the Love From Hell is a bit darker than the others in the A.R. series and so far (up to p. 172) there is no humor at all."
2,"This movie is awesome! It comes with bonus footage, and it arrived so fast! It was my first time using amazon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a product they are having a hard time finding in stores."
2,"Disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of music, inasmuch as I prefer rock and adult contemporary. After hearing the appetizer ""Cobrastyle"" as a current staple of the alternative radio realm, I was anxious to see the full menu. I also heard an interview of the three core band members from Stockholm about 3 weeks ago.The album is an eclectic mix of techno pop, shining brightest when showcasing the irresistible thumping dance rhythms. The overall experience brought back a certain frenetic dance energy I haven't felt in over 10 years. Overall, I am very glad I bought it. I expect it will be a hit at any party. Turn the volume up and let loose!The highlights for me are ""Cobrastyle"", ""Different Sound"", and ""Little Stereo."""
2,"This album has some of the most fascinating,bizarre sound at some points and other songs are flat out boring. Si Senor The Hairy Grill being the masterpiece of the bunch with an organ biuldup to an amazing crescendo of screaming guitars (or is it just screaming?). Dr. Van Steiner, Goldrush, the latin~tinged La Habanera, and to a lesser extent, Oh Yeah, are all fine, and incredibly inventive tunes. Shirley Bassey is great in the Rhythm Devine, but the rest is a tad blah. Still worth it for all the greatness, and was a must buy for me as I used to have it in the 80's and really missed it. Jamming out to Si Senor was worth it all."
2,"Hey, I've only got one leg, but that doesn't mean I don't know GREAT blues music when I hear it!!! I love Memphis Minnie and her rough and roudy vocals and rockin' guitar style, she is the epitime of the BLUES. She sings everything from jump blues, rockin' blues, delta blues to dirty blues. She has plenty of pep and energy, and sinsg liek there's no tomorrow. her delivery will hit you like an intoxicatingly wonderful tornado. You will love this cd, one Legged Willy promises, there you have it, THE ONE LEGGED WILLY GAURENTEE!!!Bottom Line: Just buy it, one legged Willy gives it the thumbs up!"
2,"The book is appealing on many levels. It has fantasy,mystery, myth and abundant humor. Most of the tales aremythical in nature. Some are fabricated tall tales.The writing is excellent, with rich detail expressed interse language. A delight from cover to cover."
1,"Discovery Kid's products are designed to ""look cool"" in the box but they are cheap plastic junk. They break. What's worse is the manual states that they are warranted by Discovery Store Inc. but if you do not buy direct from Discovery Store, they will NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY!!! So what happens? You buy your kid a cool toy. They use it for a few weeks. Then it breaks. You have crying kids. You call Discovery. You don't have an order number, they tell you to get lost.Don't buy this junk. It is guaranteed to break. Shop around and find something that is hobby quality or just select a different gift for you kid."
1,"No doubt, Clay has an incredible gift. And I'll admit his single ""Invisible"" is a nice change on Top 40 radio. However, he would be better served on Broadway."
1,Not the same item. I had to get the correct one at my local pet store. Next time buyer beware.
1,"This is a decorative item that, although it's advertized as ""crystal,"" looks a great deal more like pressed glass. It does, however, come with ""lead content warnings"" so one must assume that it is, indeed, lead crystal. But don't expect sparkle -- the item is neither cut nor polished.It's small and pretty, and comes in a cheap plastic presentation case lined with flocked paper and Disney advertising. Still, what else are you going to give to a woman cast in the role?"
2,"What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive."
2,"Constantine is based on the D.C. comics characters ""Hellblazer"",i also dont know too much about the comics, so was gradingjust as a film and have to admit it rocked the house!!!Way to go Keanu, the cast and director. Constantine has somegreat special effects, the acting is particulary good fromeveryone from Reeves to Rachel Weisz.He plays a sort of witchcraft doctor who performs exorcismsand gets rid of demons. Suddenly, well I dont want to revealtoo much, but lets just say that this movie is worth the moneyto see it in the theater. So see ""Constantine""!!!"
2,"I ordered the dress for my graduation ceremony. After reading the reviews, I ordered a size smaller than usual, and the dress is still too large- particularly in the bust. I am a C cup, but I would need DDDD's to fill the top, lol. Definitely order at least one size smaller than the size chart states.I was expecting the optional straps to be easily attached with hooks, as has been the case with all of my other strapless dresses. However, they come with nothing to attach them, and you need to sew them on if you want to use them. I wish the bowing (to maintain the shape) ran down the entire dress and not just the top. The dress also seems thinner than other satin dresses I have owned, but you get what you pay for.In all, after a little alteration, I think it will be fine for the occassion. I ordered the black, and aside from the fitting, the dress is beautiful."
1,"This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness."
2,"I have to say that I really really enjoyed this book. As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level! I hope to read any other books by Steve Berry as I'm sure that they will be as wonderful as this was!"
2,I THINK THIS ALBUM IS COOL BUT THERE FIRST ONE WAS WAY METAL. IT KIND OF MAKES ME MAD THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THERE FIRST CD AND MANY PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT AND ITS THERE BEST ONE.
1,"This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. Unless, you already own Powerpoint it is also useless. You cannot add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay. As far as adding background music good luck. The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it won't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast, complete, easy, and flexible."
2,"This is the best book on calculus that I have ever seen. However, it can never be used as a text for first year calculus students because they lack the mathematical sophistication to understand most of the material in this book. The book is not about the HOW TO, but instead it's about the WHY. There are lots of proofs and some interesting examples. This would be a good alternative book for Advanced Calculus.I read certain parts of this book when I have to teach a complicated topic to my calculus students (e.g. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Taylor Series) and then I streamline the material so that they can understand it.My main complaint is the absurd price! Try to find a cheaper used copy. It's outrageous that a book this important is so expensive."
1,"This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. ""Jim the Boy"". Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:""..."" Jim said""..."" Uncle Coran said""..."" said Jim""..."" Uncle Zeno said.The word ""said"" probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an ""oh so sweet"" typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."
2,"For some inexplicable reason teenage tragedy was a pop music phenomenon in the late Fifties and early Sixties and this single-disc collection hits all the highlights. ""Last Kiss"", ""Teen Angel,"" ""Endless Sleep,"" ""Tell Laura I Love Her,"" ""Patches"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" all went Top Ten, so apparently sad tales of adolescent woe weren't a detrement to chart success. The only real clunker here is the goofy parody ""Leader of the Laundromat."" [Surprisingly, that song went to No. 19, while ""Leader of the Pack"" was still on the charts.] If you like a good cry now and then--or just need to be reminded that not all pop hits were sunshine and rainbows--this album is for you. RECOMMENDED"
1,"Let's face it, Hot Space is filled with filler. But if you love Queen, and I indubitably do, you'll find several splendid touches. But you have to go mining for them...rather than having them explode into you, as great Queen so incomparably does. We must come out of denial and admit that this album is weak gruel, with more than a few good moments floating in it. But it is Queen, and even bad Queen has its pleasures."
1,"The product was delivered as promised in good shape and no damage,but,when it comes to keeping you cup of coffee hot,it doesnt. In fact, it barely keeps a steaming hot cup of coffee warm.Not at all what I expected. If I had any idea of the poor performance of this product, I wound never have purchased it. Please save your money!"
2,"I love this book - couldn't put it down! It's a quick read, yet it's filled with information that will help you transform your business and your life.If you own a small business then you need to read this book. Owning a successful business *and* having a life outside your business is not just a pipe dream - you can really make it happen and Stephanie will show you how."
1,"There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."
2,"I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life."
2,"I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
1,"The journal of a monk, Matthew Perry, was preserved, translated,and chopped up. Some pieces were then placed in a book for publication. Disjointed, obscure in many instances and almost impossible to read without a reference library close at hand, The Illustrated Chronicles.., is a chore to comprehend with little reward for your effort. Advertised as some kind of entertaining historical memoir, it is anything but. Not for most and definetely not for me."
1,"I bought this book to read to my son's first grade class for Valentine's Day. I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne ""investigates"" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable."
1,"I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
2,If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
1,"There are headings for pictures, but no pictures. So half the content is missing from this edition. And, the remaining limericks are just silly."
2,"Fast Blow-up, Easy to handle, Comfortable, Not too big & not too small - great for Guests. Only 4 out of 5 because it looses about 15% of the air originally put in within 2 days. I still recommend this product to anybody!"
1,"If you REALLY want to write correct, you won't write ""correctly."" Yes, it's in common use but it is, by the rules of grammar, incorrect. It's an overcorrection, an unnecessary addition. Here's a simple rule of thumb: Substitute the word ""fast"" where you're thinking of adding an -ly. Would you say ""How to Speak and Write Fastly?"" No. Same part of speech, but it somehow escaped that stupid -ly trap."
1,"There is no excuse for the CD to be made. I thought when it was first announced it would be HIGHLIGHTS from the box set and a couple other songs they didn't put on the box. This CD is overburdened with scraps, there were great (full) songs on With The Lights Out, but only a couple of them show up here. Once again, the Cobain estate is going to try to sap us as much as possible until they give us a complete rareties, compilation and b-side tracks set. Buy the box set and make your own compilation."
1,"i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"
1,"I did not like these diapers at all! They leaked at night and even during the day. As soon as my 10 month old daughter peed in them, these diapers hung to the knees."
2,"This text was in good shape, no bent pages, marks, etc. It also came quickly before I needed it for my class...and I'm based in China too. So was a good purchase overall!"
2,"I bought this book after a tough year of thyroid ups and downs. It has empowered me to understand and ask the right questions for a change. So informative but on a level that anyone can understand. After reading my copy, I bought one for my sister, who also has thyroid problems. Her mother-in-law saw it and bought two more copies for friends. Its great for family members of hyper-hypo- thyroid too. It will increase thier understaning. I bought a few books and this was the best, by far!"
1,my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
2,"Needed for a wedding and they worked. They are a little tight but I'm stretching them out, width wise but other than I like them a lot!"
1,"Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio."
2,"Having travelled to Africa many times, I found this novel truly evocative of the tropical center of the continent--its people and their lives, its complexity, its mystery. THe tensions between the Americans and their new African neighbors make clear that we cannot just drop ourselves into a new culture without serious ramifications. The main characters are beautifully drawn, and the plot is intricate, interesting and believable. I highly recommend this book."
1,"okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION"
2,This is my favorite DM cd. It is exceedingly moody....which makes it hit you right in the gut. This isn't a dance cd; it's a moody cd. It was meant for your darker emotions; for you to explore them.
2,"It is said that George Orwell lifted some material for ""1984"" from this book, and one can truly see the parallels. ""We"" is a masterpiece; though not always as involving as ""1984"", it is well constructed and powerful. A fairly quick read, ""We"" will keep you interested and leave you with an interesting literary history lesson."
1,"I found 1984 to be an intriguing book. The plot of the book was interesting. How the author went about telling the story was too slow for me. I found it hard to pay attention while reading it. Throughout the entire book there were bits of intereseting parts followed by several paragraphs of, what i found to be, random information. I though it was a great plot but the storyline wasn't to my liking."
1,"nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. ."
1,"R Kelly it seems has gone from a super producer and good singer to an arrogant, wanna be thug. This guy really trips me out. He sings a song about feeling on a girl's butt. How immature is that? 12 play, although very sensual... Was good. To see him regress like this is pretty ...! To see all of these garbage collaborations with whack hip-hoppers like Jay Z is equally ....! This guy has not evolved, but has dissolved. A once good singer has completely done a 180!"
1,"So when I orginally purchased this item in store, I feel in love with the scent. So upon running out of my perfume I was destined to find the scent online and replace it. But after ordering it and wearing it a couple of times, I realized the smell from this scent was a tad-who am I kidding, wayyyy different from the scent that I smelled in the store. Sorry, but I just don't believe this is the same With Love scent I purchase. Smelled like a cheap attempt to manufacture the real thing -__-"
1,"I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe, hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again."
2,"If I read one more scathing review from some so-called music critic I am definitely going to have to start cancelling some subscriptions! This is a great, great album! It's so nice to actually be able to understand the words and Mr. Aiken's voice is just incredible! I went to work today with the lyrics running through my head and a smile on my face! I am so tired of critics trying to categorize Clay's music. I'm probably the last person who expected to be so connected to Clay's music. Two weeks ago I got a speeding ticket on the way home while listening to Aerosmith! There's just something so wonderfully refreshing about Clay and his music!"
2,"I used this amp to power a pair of Anthony Gallo Micro Ti speakers, used the powered Gallo Sub. This amp is perfect for the hidden installation, and the primary connection is to an iPod doc with sVideo to the HDTV to view the choices on the iPod, and to make playlists with out connecting back up to the PC. The second input to the amp, the one that takes over when powered up and providing a signal is connected to a universal disc player, for stereo playback of cd's, and DVD audio. The AMP is quite small, and fits in the corner shaped cabinet that had a very limited depth issue for the electronics components."
1,really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
2,"Within 24 hours of using this product there is already a huge difference in my skin. I love it! It's light, it smells great, and it really does what it claims to do."
2,"This is the book about the generation that went through the great depression and WWII, which for most of us is our parents and grandparents. This generation has gone too long underappreciated as useless old farts by the Boomers, Xers and the latest generation. We forget that they built modern America thorugh their sacrifices and just plain old determination. While one might quibble with Brokaw's claim of this generation being the greatest (how about the revolutionary war and civil war gens), they are unquestionably the greatest alive today. Brokaw chronicles in easy-to-read vivid vignettes the lives of an assortment of WWII vets from all walks of life. While one might yearn for a bit more detail on the transition from wartime sacrifice to peacetime production, its still a must read for putting the accomplishments of this great generation into perspective."
1,"Hmm.. I actually really like Keanu, but this was not a good role for him. If he had played it a bit more like Depp in 'Pirates...' it may have been ggoofy fun. The only amusement comes from Swinton and Stormare as Gabriel and Satan respectively. Plus, Gavin (Bush's frontman) is creepy enough. Weisz's performance is nothing special (her accent always stinks!).As people have said the story makes no sense. It is tentative in its storytelling... is this an action film or a religious film? Problem is it fails to be either or both. The only grace outside of Stormare and Swinton is that the visuals are cool.If you haven't seen this, just walk away, rewatch the Matrix or something like the Ninth Gate for creepy religous movies."
2,"I thought that The Ring was funny when that girl came out of the TV. I still get a kick out of how ""not scary"" that was. The Grudge made me cackle with joy when the hairy ghost girl emerged, how funny! Nothing seem to scare me in theatre anymore, except for this movie. I didnt really know what it was about when I saw it, and I atually got goose bumps. It combines good acting with many types of horror. The horror of being trapped in a cave system and then finding out you are not alone in there! There are times when you feel your heart pace quicken because of the tight situations. Basically, just watch it and dont watch it alone! Make sure its dark and enjoy!"
2,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever."
1,"Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it"
1,"The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it."
1,"This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
1,Please be honest to your clients. Please ship for the value we pay. Please do not send used pajama for a new one. I have to have a vey used pajama for the value of $109.00. It is very unfair.
1,"I should have went by the reviews on this, but i didn't because my 2 boys (triplets) wanted this so bad I bought 2 of them.. They haven't even looked at them since X-mas... The fell apart and everything that was written about them was %100 TRUE! next time i make sure my decsion is based on the reviews.. What a waste of Money! they were $39.99 each at the time of my purchase. anyway i would not reccomend this toy at all."
1,"This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??"
1,"If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!"
2,What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is a classic....My 4 yr old granddaughter saw it for the first time and fell in love with Snoopy.
1,"Save your money. It's pure hype. If you listen to more than one station, you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked. If you listen to anything but pop, it's useless. It's just a gadget to get you to buy CD's through their web site."
2,"My 3 year old is in LOVE with paint and this makes the whole idea of ""Painting"" more bearable for me. Instead of cleaning up paint messes on the carpet, on her and on the walls - I can sit her down on the sidewalk with this and she can paint away on everything (including the trees) to her heart's content. Wish they offered more colors, but being able to teach her that Blue+Yellow=Green is also a bonus."
2,"Nice sounding CD as a whole. Finally, not a mention of ""bling bling"" on a current release. While many I am certain were hoping for a virtual replay of all of their favorite Clay songs sung during the American Idol competition, this set showcases what a nice voice this young man has. Sure, there is a tinge of ""predictability"" here. Then again, what did you expect? Sit back and enjoy it."
1,"I wanted to try this product for my baby girl. To my surprise, it was too small for her when compared with other brand level 1 diapers. I had to reorder my diapers again."
2,"This book talks about loneliness and how people dreamed about having their own land, because it was hard to have a land in that time because of the Great Deppression the United States passed through."
2,This is an amazing deck of cards. They are very easy to use with some practice and you can fool anyone into thinking you are a true magician. This is a great buy for anyone who likes card tricks. It is lots of fun.
2,Ordered for my stepdaughter for Christmas at her request.Arrived very quickly and new as stated.She has watched the series already and loves it - so will ahve to give this an A+.Thank you
2,"Two wonderful classic stories on one dvd. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, who could ask for more? This is a priceless treasure that should be in every classic movie lovers collection!"
2,"thanks for the super fast shipping, this dress really is super comfortable!! thanks to the other that wrote their reviews, it really helped when deciding weather or not to purchase this dress!"
1,"Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes. This book is a joke. Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this. Heart attack city! Oh, and crappy food. Did I mention how bad her recipes are? Terrible. The scourge must be stopped! Whoot!"
1,"Mounting the rack on the vehicle is not an easy process. The rack is not designed for cars with plastic bumpers. The thumb screws that tighten the legs & arms are made of cheap black plastic and can easily be stripped. The Saris Bones 805-2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack is poorly designed.May I suggest you go out and purchase a Thule bike carier, or hitch mount carrier by Thule. You get what you pay for..."
1,"While entertaining, there's not much ""game"" to this... game. It's all luck, no strategy or ability to impact how the game moves or progresses. While that may be age-appropriate for 2 year olds, this game is definitely well below the suggested developmental age range of 4. I wouldn't even rate the educational value of this game very high, as by the age of 4, kids can already count, discern directions, and read symbols. The game isn't worthless, just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair, and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children. As this game has small pieces, though, it wouldn't be feasible to play this game with children in that age range. I don't recommend this game for 4+. Rather, check out Kids of Carcasonne, or Monza."
1,"Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business."
1,"Let me get this straight. The story starts with a man and a woman, strangers looking at vacant apartment. They walk around a bit, say a few words, then he grabs her and they go to it. Nothing is given to justify this, no romance, no chemistry, no flirting, not even lustful looks. It is as if two people just ran into each other on the street and went straight at it. This is great film making? On what planet?"
1,"I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!"
2,"We put this together as a family and it was fun and educational too. I was happy see my family learning and spending time together. The puzzle was tricky but, fun.We will do this puzzle many more times as the kids grow up I am sure. I recommend it!"
2,This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic. The book makes the characters realistic. It is haunting and morbid. I would suggest this book for anyone who would like a most creative and intersting view on the Civil War.
2,"Brilliant recording, great songs, just enough flavour of the concert without too much talking, not enough singing. Nice to see Herself allow the imperfections that make her human, but still so far above the most perfect of anyone else. She is a treasure of the world."
2,"In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983,following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefall,whose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs:WHAT ABOUT LOVE is a hard-rocker featuring Starship's Grace Slick on background vocals. IF LOOKS COULD KILL was a minor hit. NEVER is another hard-rocker. THESE DREAMS is considered adult comtemporary. NOTHING AT ALL sounds cool. All the other songs are very good."
2,"Other than my boots for which I have a standing-tiered shoe rack, this shoe tree is perfect with enough room to let my 9.5 women's size shoes hang without hitting one another. It has a weighted bottom so that it doesn't fall over and I can easily use the handle on top to pull it out of my closet if I am thoroughly confused as to what pair to wear on a particular day. Definitely a must especially if you have a walk-in closet."
2,this is a very good book for the younger readers. it is straight forward and gives good halloween costume ideas for little kids
2,"Great sound if you position it one foot from a bare wall, squarely. These speakers need to breathe. Crisp high notes, particularly any Classical music or vintage Rock N' Roll...."
2,"This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet."
2,I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a lovely story and written very well. It let's us know that everyone is human and in all communities there are good things and not so good things. Take the good and leave the rest. I have drawn on some of Sue Bender's experiences with the Amish and applied them in my own life. How wonderful to be able to read about someone else's experience and feel like you are there by their side.
2,This slim book is only 31 pages long; but don't let its appearance fool you: Reading The Wild packs in details on reading the signs of animal life and will require good reading skills from grades 4-6. Doolittle's beautiful full-page illustrations lend to nature facts organized by animal type and revealing the animal's habits and habitat.
2,WOW!! This cd is outstanding from start to finish! Every song is great! I can't even pick one song that i really don't care for. Good job Clay....your first cd is worth 5 STARS. Buy this today!
1,what went wrong with Robocop? The first two are violent and watchable but this one is a disappoint and is only entertaining to a point.
2,No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
2,"This book will not offend the non-catholic like others may. Best overall explanation of misunderstood beliefs about the church I have read. Both Catholics and non-Catholics will benefit from this read. When I explain to my family and friends my reasons for converting, I usually refer to this book."
1,This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference).
2,"Yeah,great start to the series.Pity there is only 6 episodes in the 1st season.Already watched it loads of times.John Ritters humor as usual stands out.No extras on this dvd.But all the episodes are good.Here are the episodes.01. A Man about the house02. And Mother makes four03. Roper's niece04. No children, no dogs05. Jack the giant killer06. It's only moneyBuy it!So we can get all the seasons released.This show rulz."
2,I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.
2,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature."
1,"When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book."
1,"yet i guess the movie must be great, i did not see that this dvd is only for certain countries n doesnt play here in the States.. so that kinda sucks money down the drain...."
2,This is the second one that I purchased. I love it. I can see both TiVo devices and shared recordings between the two.
1,of the 4 phones 1 had a bad battery. It hasn't been worth the trouble of returning since there are still 3 good phones. might be what you get with amazon
1,"If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
2,"B McKnight is still the man. I've been listening to his stuff for years and I keep waiting for him to have the ""one"" album that's just ghetto. I'm still waiting. His vocals are literally flawless. My favorite track is ""What We Do Here"" and ""Stay."" Definitely worth the cost and then some... if you're looking for some smooth groove for your groove."
2,"If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!"
2,"I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
1,"We were dissapointed to discover that the DVD that we got was the same format and picture quality as the original VHS. I believe there is a restored version, we streamed a good quality full screen version from Netflix and I will be looking for this on DVD."
2,"I've always been a fan of film scores, and I've wanted this one on CD for a long time. I got the LP version when the film was first released & still have it. What makes this CD special is the fact that there are alternate selections included that were not part of the original CD release, and that this release was limited to 3,000 copies. I've been enjoying it very much!"
2,"Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna."
2,"Although later historical facts have put a few holes in the details of this CD and the original book, the content was in the main true to the actual happenings. Clifton Webb's acting job was top notch. A good spy stroy based on actual events."
2,"This is the most detailed bobble head I've ever seen. Its heavy, sturdy, all handpainted clothing, inscriptions on each pant leg, straight thizzface. I got one of the new Andre Macassi bobble heads and its a piece of crap compared to this one, which is why I'm guessing the Thizzelle Washington one was a limited edition of only 5000 handmade. Bummed these are sold out now, I need another one for my gameroom!!"
2,"This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
1,"I would acttualy give it 0 stars. This book accuses the ming and Qing Emperors as horrible rulers and doesnt mention much about the manchus. it also criticies to much about the Qing Dynasty. Also, the information is OUTDATED/ along woith many words. DO NOT BUY THIS BOKK! DONNT EVEN LOOK AT IT!"
1,"I recently bought this shoe rack for my husband but after hanging the shoes, the rack started to wobble. It is not standing as it should, I have to rest it against the wall"
1,"After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time."
2,These diapers fit my sons butt and legs great. They also keep blowouts to a minimum as long as you pull out the ruffles/flaps.
2,"I used to dislike Adam Sandler films, but I think he's mellowed and has softer edges these days. Drew Barrymore is perfectly cast. This is a pleasant distraction that requires only that yoju wear your heart of your sleeve."
2,"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the ""clans"" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"
1,"I purchased these for my 7-month-old. They are supposed to keep your baby ""dry"" for up to 12 hours (box states). I'd put these on our baby at 9 p.m. By 4 a.m. they'd be full to the point that they had wet his sleeper (so we'd have to change his clothes at 4 a.m. which did not help our sleeping routine.) I would buy something else and not spend the money on Pampers again. I am now using Parent's Choice diapers from Walmart and these work better for us."
2,My son learned his numbers so quickly with the help of this puzzle. He loves all of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and I figured this would be great to help him learn his numbers. I was right! Great present! Highly recommended!
2,I'm a first time reader of 1984 and am in love. I can't believe that it didn't show up in my reading list before now! I have been a long time fan of dystopia and am so excited to have read finally a founding book of the genre.I was absolutely enthralled. It has been a while since a book has grabbed me like this. To say I'd recommend this book is a gross understatement. If you've been holding off on reading this stop holding off!!
2,"Just watched this on FearNet and will definitely buy this on dvd! I love crappy, gorey, over the top films and while it breaks no ground it harkens back to the beloved films of the 1980's that throw away plot and logic for gore gags and fun. Crispin Glover is great as Simon and this movie delivers on all levels. Fans of the original Mother's Day, Texas Chainsaw 2 and others of this ilk will enjoy this. I am not saying it is as good them, but good for a chuckle and midnight rewatching. Recommended!"
1,"I bought this product only to find out it is incompatible with my DirecTV DVR with Tivo service. If this had only been clearly indicated like it was on the box, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,"My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty."
2,"The DVD was amazing.. My whole family watched, we love Usher..This was better than going..I could see his every move.Thank you Amazon you make shopping easy.."
1,"As light weight sci-fi/horror anthologies go this is probably good value for money (given its low price), but the apparent lack of good editing and of proper proof reading is painfully evident and you definitely won't find any candidate for a Hugo or Nebula award.You'll find a couple of interesting ideas, a lot of trite and derivative ones and occasionally some baffling lack of coherent character development.There's enough to show that Messrs. Jason Brannon, Eric S. Brown and John Grover have the potential to write something good, but it seems to be, at the moment at least, unfulfilled potential."
2,"This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
1,I ordered according to my size. The dress fit great except for the chest area was EXTREMELY to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style. Couldn't exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great.
1,"I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's ""genius"" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."
2,"Great taste --- great snack.For the price I couldn't beat it. Onlyproblem, trying to eat in moderationwhen watching a movie!"
2,"Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music. Though personally this isn't my favorite album that she's made, however the songs Momento, Close to you, Azul, and Cade Voce in my opinion are more of the rare gems Bebel has added to her already popular arsenal of great Bossa Nova music. Any true fan of hers would be satisfied with her overall performance of this album. Keep it up Bebel!!!!!"
1,"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
2,"I have purchased three of other Bjorks releases (Vespertine, Greatest Hits, Medulla) and this is sadly the worst (not to say It's bad, I did give it 4 stars) but this just seems too simplistic for Bjork, although I do like her dance/club songs from her debut.The standouts are Army of Me (4/5), It's Oh So Quiet (4.5/5 - my favourite), Enjoy (4/5), I Miss You (4/5), and Headphones (4/5) and I don't really like tracks 8 and 10.Some sales information for you:: Sold 3 million copies w/w, and peaked at #2 in Australia, #32 in USA and also went platinum there. It's Oh So Quiet was Bjork's greatest hit in Sales and it won numerous awards.79%"
1,"This was one of the few books that drove me to sleep some times and bearly awake at others, You either LOVE it or HATE it and frankly it is only good to drive Owls to sleep at night. It is not JUST a yawner but it was so sereal it didn't seem like historical fiction at all it remains a tail of a un mentaly balanced father with a screwy daughter that needs a labotomy. In short this book could of used more refining because it is way off!PS:GET TO THE POINT!"
1,"When I received this item, I plugged it in and smoke immediately began to pour out of the base. I left it for a moment or two, thinking that it may have just been a build up of dust or plastic residue (or whatever) burning off on the first use.After 30 - 40 seconds, the smoke was billowing out even more heavily and I detected a increasing burning smell.At that point I unplugged the thing rather than leaving it to (possibly) burst into flames!So, for me, this item was a TOTAL waste of money - and not worth the postal costs of returning it."
2,Sunsout puzzles are top quality. The pieces are thick with a nice top finish. Each piece is easy to handle and the cuts are clean. Very enjoyable. Always a top quality puzzle.
1,"This product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the book. I was disappointed with this since I wanted a new version of this book."
2,Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
2,"Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!"
1,I purchased this to create labels for gifts. I found it easier to create the labels with the templates that come with the labels (Avery). So I'm not using this product at all.It might be ok for DVD labels. I didn't try that.
2,"I love spell books and if you are the same way, this is a must have for your collection. It has it all: The days of the week best to perform a spell, the phase of the moon, magickal tools,directions to face, formations to cast etc. It is your cookbook type of publication which makes it easy to figure out. The affirmations before each spell are beautiful. They make you think and are good advice. Diane stays non-denominational and combines belief systems. I have heard you should not combine systems and then I have heard whatever works for you is best.Well, the way she takes you through these rituals is perfect for me. This book is different because it is not based on astrology, just the basic moon phases. I loved her other book ""White Light The Complete Guide to Spells and Rituals for Psychic Protection"" but for me this book is more fun and something you use time after time..."
2,"Well.With news that C-Murder tried to kill a man at a club recently (August '01), I thought Id review the CD. Trapped in Crime is probably C-Murder's second best CD. It's better than Bossalinie but not quite as good as Life or Death. The CD features the usual suspects like Master P, Silkk, Snoop Dogg, Krazy, Magic, so you know theyll be bringing the heat. The CD seems to have more ballads or whatever you wanna call them, compared to other No Limit/C-Murder CDs. Overall though its a good album worth buying if you like No Limit."
1,"Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
1,"I've heard all the albums, seen them live, and all I can say is ""Phish-Lite"". I'm glad that they are doing what they are doing, but they wear their influences on their sleeve."
2,"The book is a recast of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics which was summarized ih Mortimer Adler's Time of Our Lives. What James O'Toole does well is to weave his personal story and struggles with these issues in a language and context of today. I found this personal view refreshing and move Aristotle's theory to a very practical level. The book is clearly aimed at baby boomers, like himself, who are struggling with meaning and unfulfilled career aspirations. Personally, O'Toole's writing got me to think more about the question of whether all vices are ""fun and exciting"" and all virtue is ""boring"". The book is easy to ready and allows one to access easily Aristotle's important writings. I recommend it for anyone struggling with these issues.P.B.Boston, MA"
2,"I love this book and must disagree with another customer who reviewed it saying that obviously the magazine had nothing to do with it. I know one of the featured designers, who confirmed that he was chosen by the magazine editor to appear in the book. And the long bok introduction is written by the editor in chief herself."
2,"Good quality, style, and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver"
2,"This is a great product and I have used it for years. It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control."
2,"Probably one of the best alternate reality books I have read. It places interesting characters into interesting what-if scenarios. The periodic injection of real persons such as Bob Dylan, DR. Martin Luther King, etc still working to improve life gives additional substance."
1,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own."
1,"You look thru a pin-hole to get the sighting, but you can't see thru the pinhole if you wear glasses. If you take your glasses off then you can see thru, but if you're near-sighted like me then you won't be able to see very far in the distance to tell what you're sighting."
2,"Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me."
2,Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!
2,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
1,"like the birdies sing...cheep cheep...yep they are cheapi got the izzue (sp) shirt and it was great...these blass ones, not so great...plus amazon plays the price game, they were 5 bucks, but then came a special promo, they raised the price to 7.50...to get you to buy more; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each, gamesmanship....gotta really watch amazon prices, always double check at other sites...like the contek sunglasses, amazon had them at 130 retail....heck the mfr only had them retail at 80...games"
2,The babies both seem comfortable. The only issue I have is I HAVE to wake for night changes as my twins seems soaking wet if I wait until morning
1,"This is BAD! It was so bad, I returned it. The virtual people look cheap, like cardboard, and they keep repeating the same word until you just want to scream! Trust me, I'm not just saying this to be mean, it's the truth. If you don't believe me, just buy it, and then you'll see."
1,"This album is just plainly a dissapointment. Half the album is brilliant and the other half, well they should have just put this out as and e.p. with only half of the songs. Sure Pillars, Every shining time, and How it feels to be, are brilliant. But they are ruined by 100 million, Two Promises, and Roses in Water. I expected this to be their best album (after hearing Jeremy's solo album, which is a must buy) but it just turns out to studio, which means not that much emotion. Sure Jeremy is screaming, but there is nothing in his scream. Maybe Nate was more important than they'll admit. The emo is only slightly there and that is what they are EMO! Not alt-rock. Don't start with this one. Buy Diary, and hear what one of the most promising bands of all time used to sound like. Maybe they shouldn't have gotten back together."
2,"""Definitely Maybe"" is simply definitely (no maybe) a great album! The songs are good, and only the beginning to what will become the Oasis sound. Songs ranging from the loud and proud, ""Supersonic"" to the quaint ditty ""Digsby's Dinner"", to the infectious (and my personal favorite) ""Columbia"". This is really a very good album, not even considering the fact that it's a debut. It is not anything like the critics say : a carbon copy of pre-Brit rockers The Beatles, Rolling Stones, or David Bowie. Comparisons could be made that they're all British and play guitars... I mean really... it's not like they just rehash the same stuff! This album is well done musically and delivers the unmistakable vocals of that Brit Brat Liam Gallagher. Simply a great album to have if you want to hear some snappy music that isn't always about angst, but isn't candy either...."
2,"The quality of this products is very nice, the item is original, not is copy. The color is great and it is new item.The time to travel and bla bla is accepted"
1,"Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf"
1,"This book is about 2012 end-time predictions rather than actually ""decoding the lost science of prayer and prophecy"". Just a disappointing read."
1,"what a piece of garbage....just thinking of it is making my bowels move...again....OH GOD, i gotta go back on the bowl!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"If your looking for an art book with more art similar to the cover, Keith Parkinson, look elsewhere. There is very little sword and magic fantasy contained inside. This book was a major let down. Parkinson's art is maybe the first four to five pages, after that the pages would best be used right before a flush."
2,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Sonoma. I was pleasantly shocked! I couldn't believe how many crazy things were happening, and it just kept getting crazier and crazier. From the beginning of the movie there is no way to prepare for the turn that the movie takes. The situations that the obsessed Moz fan gets herself into are both hilarious and disturbing. And all the supporting characters were wacky too. What kind of twisted mind made this flick? While it didn't leave me feeling warm and fuzzy, it definitely left me with a smile."
1,i never get the item but was my fault i order to other adress sorry but i guess is a good product
2,"Ich htte eine sehr dringende Frage.Gibt es Buffy Videos auch in Deutsch?Mir scheint es so,dass diese Videos nur auf Englisch sind.Ich wrde dann auch gerne wissen wann der Buffy Soundtrack(zur Serie)auf den Markt kommt.Knnten sie mir helfen."
1,"I ordered the Dashmat under the premise that it was an easy install, being mechanically retarded this appealed to me....lol...I'm sure it would have been easier had the velcro that came with it actually stuck to the dash. I did what the instructions said, clean the dash thoroughly with a mild solution, NO Armoral, my dash hadn't seen Armoral in 10 years in fact. So after fighting, sweating, and swearing over the non-sticky velcro I found myself at the auto store looking for industrial strength velcro. After about 2 hours I had it installed."
2,"The book has great general info. on the numerous trails in our nation's biggest state. The information on trails that I hiked in the Palmer and Seward areas were right on the money, and I hope to use the guide on future trips up north."
1,"I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
1,"It's $39.00 on the apple website, there is free shipping as well, so why buy it on amazon? I came here looking for a deal and was disappointed."
1,I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others.
2,"This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation."
2,"I feel that all religions have pieces of the truth and it is up to us to find them and learn. And yes men and the churches do believe that only they are worthy and women ate thereto serve them and do the menial things that they find beneath them. But if you read the old testament women have important roles that God requests of them, men ate the ones who have the most trouble believing and following that they have to prove themselves more often. Faith, love, acceptance of others as they are is really the bottom line and will bring peace if only mankind could learn and embrace that truth."
1,I muddled through the old world language of his early adult years and enjoyed reading about how different colonial America was and how people just freely moved wherever life took them but then we hit the big gap where he didn't write and after that all he covered was his philosophy of life. I quit reading half way through the book.
2,"Love the show, hope that it makes it for a second season. Love all the characters and think that they all do a great job with their characters CBS keep this show on the air"
2,"The author states this is a fictional work with some incidents and characters based on historical fact. As a non-Catholic, I found the book very interesting; die-hard Catholics might be offended by it.Colin Michener is the papal secretary to his mentor and pope, Clement XV. Clement keeps returning to the private papal archives more and more because something bothers him. He sends Colin on a journey that leads him to more and more trouble and mystery. Clement's archrival Alberti Valendrea, papal secretary of state, and his accomplice, Paolo Ambrosi, do nothing to promote peace and harmony...just death and a return to the dark ages of the church. The third secret reveals surprising directives that popes have been ignoring for years."
1,Living in Australia we are in the middle of our first series of Australian Idol so I was very curious as to what Clay Aiken actually sounded like so brought this CD. I found the majority of the CD rather boring. I do already own both Kelly and Justins CD's both of which I find alot more entertaining than Clays.Clay's CD seems very radio friendly and MORish which I spose alot of people would like but I found that maybe I needed the Hype of American Idol II to enjoy him more.
1,"I'll admit it, I didn't have a clue what was going on in this book (which claims to be real, but is obviously a work of fiction), nor did I really have much of a reason to.UFOs...Men in black...Mothmen...Abductees...government coverups...sightings...It's all here, and regardless makes no sense whatsoever.I actually walked into this thinking it was going to be great, that there would be a wonderful story based upon the legend of the mothman, but no I was bombarded with 266 pages of ""research"" having no really meaning, or thesis. Honestly, I say avoid this like the plague."
1,"I have had this cookbook for a couple of years without really using it. But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters. I am also not the type to write book reviews (this is the first and probably the only) except that I think so highly of this cookbook that I wanted to recommend it to others."
2,"I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. I have discovered that the right dishwasher detergent takes care of this. I was using a phosphate-free powder, for ecological reasons, but it was not getting my dishes clean. Researching this, I learned that in the last year, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents have improved a lot, so this problem may go away by itself. Otherwise, try a different phosphate-free detergent; the tablets seem to work best."
1,I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money. The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out. Dont buy this product!! Its very cheap!!
2,This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.
1,"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
2,"Really a great film! I bought this wanting to get to know more about Pio's life and who he was and this DVD definitely delivers.It's over 300 minutes long and every minute completely gripped me - no exaggeration. The acting is good and the main actor resembles Pio quite a bit.It is very well made and if you have any interest in the life of Padre Pio and who he was, or just simply want to get to know more about him, I would definitely recommend this movie. It is superb. 5 stars."
2,I really liked this movie. I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once. Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.
1,"Among other weaknesses, it was clear that the author didn't know San Francisco very well. That should have been a warning! Too many cliches, not enough depth at all- this could have been a rich disturbing story, instead it was one dimensional and rather juvenile. Dissapointing"
1,"1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."
1,"My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it. I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to (luckly!) revive it. This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google ""u3 cruzer format problem"" and you'll understand the problem."
2,"Great way to educate people, especially kids, about the world around them. It covered different aspects of the countries and cultures it highlighted"
1,"Where do I start, how about I hate these diapers!! This gel stuff leaks out of them, all the time. They don't last long on active babies. Not to mention that I have to clean up leakage. Try another brand please!!"
1,"My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("
2,This was a very brief but very engaging story wonderfully read by Gary Sinise. It is very touching and I didn't want it to end the way it did but I knew it had to. Great Story.
2,"This was pretty good stuff. I didn't agree with everything, but it did cause me to think about some things."
1,"Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead."
1,Birthright uses the battle system rules that are o.k. but they are not as fun as doing a mass battle by group.
1,"This system is horrid. Not only have I had problems with it skipping, pausing, and completely freezing, but so has a friend of mine with the same system. I dont recomend this product to anyone unless you dont mind a great movie skipping, pausing out for a second or so, or completely freezing up on you. I personally find it very frustrating. The sound is decent for the little money, but this skipping, pausing, and freezing is enough to make you want to throw your new machine in the trash."
1,"This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
2,"great product. my husband loves it. his old one was all rusted and well used, so i was very excited to find this one (especially for the price). nothing special, very basic, but works fine for in his manstand at the farm."
2,"There to cds on this album.The first one is Accelorator.Accelorator is very good like... i like a couple of the songs but this is more of a more techno album. It has more the plan one bass beats. But i love some of the songs. I mean i love all the songs but if you like hardcore tchno.... i would'nt suggest the first disk. But buy it anyway becauser the second disk is fabulous!! Its the papa New Gueni (or how ever you spell) remixes. Hibrid,blue states,simone,mellow and more remix papa new gueni. The second cd in my apinion is better but its always different opinions. you should defenetly put some thought in and buy this album. its great!!!!"
2,I've been a fan of Freebo's since the days he backed up Bonnie Raitt on fretless bass and blues tuba. I recently had the opportunity to see him playing with Maria Muldaur. I met him after the show and bought his CD based on hearing him perform one tune from it. This CD is a killer! I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock. I hope he has more of this to share with us in a follow on album. This was worth the wait to hear him leading the way! Try it. You'll like it!
2,"I liked this. It was well written and the special affects were high-quality. I also enjoyed the acting and the fact that it wasn't extra corny like any of the prior Batman films. I think Bale did a excellent job as Batman along with the supporting cast. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't too thrilled with the fact that they took an awfully long time building up Bruce Wayne's character. We only get to see him in action as Batman for the last 30 minutes of the film. Another thing that I was puzzled about was the decision to cast Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love interest. It didn't seem like there was too much chemisrty between the two, to me. I think her role was absolutely pointless and it added nothing to the film. Other than those two things I think its a decent film to rent or possibly buy to add to your collection."
1,"For the raw beginner wishing to gain an insight into the various methods of gluing veneer using a variety of different adhesives and their accompanying techniques, this book more than adequately serves to address this function. However, the all-important minutiae of veneering are not touched upon in any respect. The art of veneering lies not so much in the methods of gluing, but in the laying-out and trimming, particularly where the edges are concerned. An examination of any piece of pre 20th century cabinetwork will bear out this conclusion: the edges are blended with an almost surgical degree of precision to give the impression that the piece has been hewn from a solid piece of wood. This book's title should read: ""A Beginner's Guide to Gluing Veneer"" which is a far more accurate description of this book's contents and function."
1,"As a fan of Wu Tang Clan for the last 11 years I find myself being more dissapointed with each solo cd released.This by far is the worst Ghostface cd and the worst solo cd from the clan. I bought it the day it came out, listened to it once and that was it.Ghost needs Rae, Rae needs Rza and Rza needs to go back to what made Wu Hot with the beats and shaolin sounds. And please if your going to make another cd Ghost please put Wu members on it. Want a 5 star cd go back to what made Iron man hot, thats the only cd of his worth buying."
1,"1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting."
2,"I can't recommend this highly enough. Years ago it was the first eye opener for me that history might not be all the textbooks said it was, but this time I simply enjoyed the humor and interactions of the characters. I think it possible that Richard III is right up there with Hamlet in my list of ""dreamy maligned heroes."" Such a great, fast read."
1,"i tried everything but he hated it. it was a no go. even though i set it to a snug fit, he kept pawing at it until he was finally able to get it into his mouth and chew on it."
1,"Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money."
2,"When reading this book for a seventh grade book report, I fell deaply in love with it!!! It was all so realistic. I was given a month and a half to read the book and write the report, but now I am finished after four days!!! I love this book and will read it many more times in my life time! I belive Betty Smith Deserves great praise for her work in this book. My heart goes out to the Nolan family. They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"
1,"This is simply terrible... It is badly written, a ""cutsy"" attempt to be the typical hard-boiled detective. Not even worth the free download."
2,"My son needed this for school, and it was perfect. The book arrived in good shape and very quickly, so work could be done on time."
2,"I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned. I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now."
1,"DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
2,"If you thot the classics were difficult and boring, well think again! This books bring them alive, and provides a beginner's understanding of just what the classics can mean to anyone. This book is both educational, as well as inspiring - even to anyone on a desert island for the past 50 years. I only wish the opera offering(s) were more extensive;maybe Zorn and August should write a similar version exclusively for opera - I wish they would. This text was required reading for a summer school class at our local Clark College, but it has become a key volume in my meager musical library, and will be referred to often."
2,"This ought to be required reading for every boy or girl between the ages of 8-12. Enjoyable, readable, exciting, and above all, heart-warming."
1,"This song was ok, but if that is what the whole album will sound like I will be pissed. They take a five year break and come up with this for a first single? Considering the time they have had, this song is a disgrace. I am thankful for the instrumental version cuz Keiths singing in it ruins the whole thing."
1,"Is the music business this desperate to go and sign this poor excuse for a musician to a record contract?A bad CD. Hey Clay, do us all a favor and retire right now, so our ears don't have to be polluted with this garbage any longer."
2,"I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. It took me over an hour to finally connect, but I don't think this is the fault of the product, just my computer. I have been connected for about 5 minutes now and it works great =). The signal's good (I'm 40 or 50 ft from the wireless router and signal strength jumps between 91% and 95%) and It's about just as fast as my other computer with a physical internet connection. I would recommend it if you're looking for something cheap that works."
2,"This printer will do everything that you would want from a low cost high output machine. The HP 1000 is the best in the photo series and I would recomend this printer to all my friends.Try it, you will like it, like all HP products."
2,"This book is the perfect kickoff to the greatest and most amazing Science-Fiction series ever. Asimov and his Foundation are the foundation of all modern science fiction. This book especially is a fascinating story full of characters so real you could expect to bump into them on the street, to speak nothing of the Doctor's amazing - and totally beleivable - futuristic technology.If you want to get a transcendental, literary experience or you just want to read a damn fine story, the Foundation series - and especially this book - are what you're looking for."
1,"Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
2,"Maybe the first book about which I can honestly say , I couldn't put it down! The way the story unfolds and resonates with the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ is remarkable!"
2,"I bought this cd immediately because I watched some of AI2 and was mesmerized by Clay Aiken's voice. Truthfully, I didn't expect much at first, as it seemed to be a hurriedly put out album. (I expected it to be cover after cover.) But, the first time I listened to MOAM, I was impressed! To those who criticise the lack of ""edginess"", you can get all the ""edginess"" you can bear from some of the rest of those ""artists"" out there....So going on two months later, where is that cd? In my home, my car, my husband's car....you get the picture. Clay should win a grammy for this cd!"
2,"Clay Aiken has delivered on his long-awaited first full-length CD. This is a great album, one that kids and parents can enjoy together. Clay's brilliant voice soars and the songs are tailored made for him. My personal favorite is ""Perfect Day."" This is a song begging to be a hit and will be if it gets radio play. We have waited decades for Clay Aiken and he has not disappointed us. Clay has the ability to find the matrix of a song and make it his own. He is a breath of fresh air in an industry that badly needs it. My advice: Run, don't walk, to buy this CD!"
1,"Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
1,"As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. He can afford a nice house and a new Lincoln Navigator on peon pay. He chases his wifes kidnappers thru a construction zone at 100 MPH, endangering everybody instead of just laying back and using the radio to tell the cops where to put a roadblock. He gets hit in the head with enough stuff to start a junkyard but never shows a mark, gets blown up at least twice without being even singed. The HiPo Camaro takes dozens of hits but they all miss the radiator, tires, electrical and fuel system. Not for anybody older than 10. It did have nice explosions, though."
2,"We ordered 2 of these for our 2 series 2 tivo's and so far, we have not had one hitch in the system. These are super easy to install, they pick up the network quickly and they have worked well so far.i recommend spending the extra money to buy the Tivo brand. it's more money, but less hassel and more satisfaction."
2,"I had been using this product for years after finding them in a local grocery store with shelved medical type items. Then both the grocery store and Walmart discontinued stocking them.I found them at Amazon, and ordered some spares. These are easy to use, can get between closely adjacent teeth and the reverse end has tiny brushes built in that are very helpful for certain uses when cleaning teeth. Also, they are washable/reuseable. They beat any wood toothpick I have used."
2,"Even though i have no connection with the american historical culture of the sea i find a large interest in history and i believe this story is a true treasure for a lover of history and any story that grabs you and pulls you in! This certainly did it for me. I didn't realise it was such a famous story, and no wonder why. The strength and hope these men had is truly remarkable! There will to live in such dire straights is much to be admired. It delves into the highest of joyous accomplishments to the lowest of human depravity and desperations. Very recommended!"
2,"When I first came across the title of the book. I was rather skeptical, is it possible to apply some of the strategies in battle to investing or is it just another book to ""ride on"" the fame of Sun Tzu.Well, I ended up buying the book and learnt quite alot about investing from reading the book. Curtis writes in a easy-to- read, easy-to-understand style and make investing fun. He also put in actual examples of how he actually used some of these strategies in analysing stocks for investing and his investing track record is shown in his website... So you can actually verify that what he shared can be applied and not just theoretical stuff and he does put his money where his mouth is.For any person interested to learn about investing, other than Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, this is another book you can consider reading up too!...Cheers!Dennis Ng"
1,I used this for an introductory EM course. Not even remotely helpful. There are not any equations. No examples. The only good pat is that the problems have odd solutions in the back.
1,"I'm shocked at all the good reviews I'm seeing! I'm a huge Queen fan, and have been since 1980. Day at the Races is wonderful. The Game is a classic. Night At the Opera is quirky, but still a good listen. But Hot Space is atrociously bad. Let me repeat that: atrociously bad. It sounds like somebody fooling around with a drum machine who didn't realize they were being recorded. It's a bad karaoke nightmare.Admittedly, yes, Under Pressure is a great song. But it couldn't possibly be more out of place unless it were included on a Megadeth CD. Really, it's that bad. Am I making myself clear? :)"
1,"This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
2,"This is a top quality soundtrack, the songs themselves range in genre, but expect a lot of guitar and techno intermixed. In my opinion, this soundtrack is a great addition to the videos (which I recommend getting)...."
2,"When I heard this I was like, wow! His songs are great, and I'll admit, he's not the most handsome person, so on his CD you dont have to look at him. Oh, and today, everyone's voices are digitally remastered so they sound better, like * cough cough* Hilary Duffs *cough cough* but not Clays! he sounds just as good live as on his CD."
1,"My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!"
2,"Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. However, it does have the worst story compare with the previous two movies. I praised transformers for its phenomenal graphics and computer graphics. It would definitely worth it if anyone is a fan of highly-advance sci-fiction movies."
1,"As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."
1,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: ""Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!"" ""Jim Climbs A Tree!"" ""Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!"" and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."
1,I was very happy to have found a manual Coffeemaker in white. I trusted the Bosch name but I was very disappointed in the longevity. After only 3 months of use it literally blew up.
1,"This isn't even close to authentic or realistic. My 3-year-old said he'd rather use the cheap plastic hats the fire departments pass out than this. The hat's PVC plastic means soft formed and when the description says ""Finished with soft red plush trim""--it's on the outside. As soon as we opened this, we knew it was going back."
1,"This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children. After over 3 decades, it would be so sad to see Gammell's version just disappear..."
2,"bought it for my heels, great my fiancee loves it, hope to buy a few more, it keeps the heels very soft."
2,"I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring."
2,"I started reading Cassie Edwards books this yr. I was into the Harlquin Super Romance Books and believe me, I havent picked one of the HSR books up since I first read this book. I have since got my mother and my best friend reading these books also. We swap books so often and everytime we see a new book by Cassie we grab it. She is an excellant write that I would not mind meeting and telling her in person that her books have touched me and my family. My love for my husband even grew stronger by the love the Indians show. I am working on my heritage (Cherokee) as we speak. Keep up the great work Cassie"
2,I dont agree with all the views of this book and quickly passed it on. It discusses some valuable advice for new parents of teenagers.
2,"Is Batman begins. It relies a little too much on heavy handed action sequences (like a Chuck Norris film or recent James Bond movie). But it does have pretty good story and I love the way the guy with the mask is such a non-cartoon like villain so unlike any bad guy we saw in Burton's or Schumacher's Batman films or the 60's Batman series with Adam west. Also, I like the way the guy playing the cop in the film is no macho stud (like Tom Selleck) but is still allowed to be heroic. I also like the brief scene with the loose women and the pool."
2,Bought for my BF. He really loves Mad Max. Figured I'd just go with the blueray-DVD combo since the price wasn't bad.
2,"Had this for almost two years because my computer jack is too far away to reach. Now I have found multiple uses for it. I can walk on my treadmill in my basement without having to turn up the volume on my tv. I just hook this up to the receiver and to my headphones, and I'm all set. I can even listen/watch media on my laptop with this extender while on the treadmill too. For the price, it's an excellent bargain."
1,"Warning! Spoiler!The secret that motivates reading this book is that Mary has given the world a message from God and the Catholic Church has kept it hidden. The secret: Gays are okay, abortion is okay, priests should be allowed to have sex, and women should be allowed to be priests.I seldom burn books but I burned this one."
2,"100 years from now, actress Mia Farrow will be remembered in her role in this classic ""horror"" movie, much more than her current role as an activist with the United Nations (UN). This aged ""horror"" movie may be a drag, but shows the supreme acting finesse of Mia Farrow. She plays a naive woman whose husband got too friendly with their Satanist neighbours. She ends up being used, conned and abused. It teaches you not to be too trusting with people with strange practices and behaviours.If you're looking for scary scenes based on 21st century digital standards, there are none. But, back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this movie was still talked about, at least till ""The Exorcist"" came around and trumped all horror cards as the best remembered classic horror movie of all time.Recommended viewing:The Exorcist: Director's Cut (Extended Edition)The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)"
1,"This product is a waste of money,everything meaning quality is ZERO in this AudioSource product!I dispensed it!"
1,It doesn't stay firm even overnight. The motor burned out after a while. I bought a Coleman. . . .
2,"Well, I'm going to have to bunk on the previous reviewer. I love my ZR45MC and have for about 10 years. Have not noticed the humm mentioned, however, will admit sound pretty much stinks; internal mic picks up too much background noise. That said, picture quality is fab. I use mine mostly for scenics, not talking heads, so a music track takes care of the noise. Interface with my Mac is on a kindergarten level. Plug it into the computer, the software starts and the computer asks if you want to download clips.Today I am looking for an external mic to see if I can solve the noise issue. Otherwise, can't think of a reason to get a different camera."
2,"In this busy, crazy, and sometimes angry world of ours, it is a gift to relax and listen to Kristi's arrangements of both original and classic music. I found the album a tool for helping me to relax at the end of a hard day, or to listen too simply for the soothing harmonies and flowing tonal art. Add this CD to your collection of ""Music for your Soul and Spirit."""
1,"I bought one a few days ago. It has already 'left' me three times. Once was after a few hours while I was trying to feed it. It seems really buggy, my items keep disappearing, and sometimes it doesn't reward the neopoints. I'm going to be taking it back, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's frustrated easily."
2,"Great. Gives you a pause to remember the real meaning of Christmas. Nostalgic and well loved. Without the glitz and flash of so much that modern Christmas has become. Simple and straight forward, young to old can enjoy it."
2,This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever read but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good book and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise's necklace that was cool.I wonder if yemonja really exists and the other spices.It is true that most of LJSmith's books are with witches and vampires and that we don't know what shapeshifters shape into but I liked the spells anyway.Email me if ya wanna chat.
1,"Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill. Look for my copy on the ""used books"" shelf."
2,"scholarly, well-researched, often humorous look at development of human notions of what is sacred and how it became so."
2,"i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
2,"Anton chekhov's ""the cherry orchard"" is a captivating, but somewhat confusing tale of an aristocratic household that comes face to face with adversity. His impressionistic portrayal of characters delivers a power packed package of meaning that both appeals to and appalls every human heart. Through a subtle messages and powerful passages chekhov purveys his sentiments about a world that is tainted by a dark cloud of selfishness. Although the play itself is tragic-like the characters are not tragic. They seem to blindly stumble upon the pages of life accomplishing absolutely nothing. Through checkhov's genius they still remain human, with dreams and fears like the rest of us. It is through these characters that chekhov's beliefs are made known."
1,what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this.
2,"I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book."
2,"Whoever read the first page of the book and like the stile of the exposition there must buy the book.There is nothing greater under the sun and on the Disk as well then that. (I can fill that my Gods are suffering because, I'm begining to belive in the book instead of them) But what can I do - it's stronger then me.What can I say (take a look on my e-mail address) It says it all."
1,Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. I am very disappointed and will need to use something to bring the table to life again!
1,This book is the worst tutorial Illustrator book out there. It doesn't explain how or why. Not a good book for those new to Illustrator like I am.
2,Eva Cassidy. What can one say. She was a shining star whose voice was a fine instrument. Her loss to music slowed the earth. This is an outstanding collection.
2,"great addition to my music collection, classic songs i can listen to over and over again, great value for what i paid for."
1,"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only ""secret"" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."
1,"Pick something else, please. I have had this printer for two and a half years. It sucks up two or three pieces of paper at a time very frequently. Forget double sided printing. I replaced my print cartridge two or three weeks ago and have printed maybe 60 pages and just got a message that my ink cartridge is almost empty. I buy hp replacement cartridges, not off brands. I do little printing and have spent much more on ink than I did the printer. The jams are ridiculous. It mishandles paper on average 50% of the time. I am shopping for a replacement just to save the headache of dealing with this printer."
1,"I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
1,"This smells like paint thinner or something. It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else, and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory. Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink, I have no idea if it is save. Who knows what's in/on this thing and I certainly wouldn't want to put it in my body...it could be leaching chemicals. Cancer comes to mind. I had to throw it away. Total waste. Don't buy it, find another supplier!"
1,"Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere."
1,"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
2,"One of the ten best adventure / mountaineering books I have ever read. Hodgson takes Kocour's adventure and guides the reader on a compelling, frightening, frequently shocking, sometimes inspiring climb up one of the world's most difficult climbs. Brilliant! I will be very surprised if this book does not become a best seller."
2,"Shoes were creating a mess on our garage floor so I purchased this unit. It works great, it is very sturdy/heavy. It was super easy to assemble (took less than 5 minutes) Fully assembled, it is pretty sturdy. It does wobble a tiny bit, but that may be because our floor is not even in the garage. The great thing is that it keeps the shoes off the floor and the kids like using it so they are more likely to put their own shoes away."
1,I bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder.
1,"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."
1,I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
1,"Ordered a Halti training collar and received, on time, a Holt collar. Called seller, not respones. ""Returns require prior authorization code,"" but request was routed to a ""mailbox full"" number. No follow up from seller."
1,Made in China. Doesn't keep my coffee warm enough. If I have a traditional small coffee mug that is half full it will keep pretty hot but if it's 3/4 full or a larger coffee mug then the coffee gets gets cold or at least not at the 125-130F degree I like. I'm returning and looking for more wattage. 17 watts isn't enough for me.
2,"Written in a conversational style with plenty of humor, this book gives you the questions and answers you need to keep and increase monies that are being put away for investing and retirement. This book lays out a program for getting the best bang for your bucks, and gives an eye opening education on how the "" Market "" really works. I have purchased three books already and am purchasing five more to give to friends and relatives who want to salvage their portfolios from the ""SHARKS"" on Wall Street."
1,"I am writing this review because I don't want another person to read the editor's reviews and believe that this CD is anything but garbage. I am a huge fan of Dirty Vegas, but by far, this is not their best effort. In fact, it took no effort on their part at all. They put a couple of songs from the 80's and 90's and compiled them on one CD. There wasn't any great beats, vocal overlays, or anything to speak of that would have made this CD unique. I could have made this CD at home on my computer and ""mixed"" it better than this. Please, if you value your money spend it on something else. Let this CD go to the wayside. You will be better for it. I ended up giving my copy away!"
2,"My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask. I inquired the seller and they confirmed there was a confusion : the description of the Costume did not include a mask , I replied even I did not notice it in the description, the picture showed the girl with the mask and there was no clarification about it. I think they should have made a clarification, it seems to me it is false publicity. It is good to know they have updated the picture."
2,"Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right. But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation. Without giving away too much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life."
2,"William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"
1,I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It didn't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it didn't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped

2,The receiver of this gift has dementa. He and his wife have looked at the pictures and talked. the book came quickly and in good
2,"Not quite sure what was going on here....kinda reminded me of a cross between Groundhog Day and the multiple-endings in ""Clue"", but fun nonetheless. Very energetic film that FLIES by!This DVD edition features and English soundtrack, as well as the German soundtrack, and the english subtitles can be turned on if you are a purist watching the German-language version. Also, the disc is two-sided, one side being full-screen, the other being letterbox."
2,I wanted to like this device....nice long cord .....switch on the base.....nice looking....but...It just did not get hot enough for my taste.....nice and warm but not hot....as we get older we want hotter it seems.....tried different glass and ceramic cups but sorry not hot enough.....heater is 17 watt....would like to have one at about 25 watts.
1,"This movie is so haorrible its not even funny.its very slow movie,the acting is bad,all of the good action takes place at the end and before you know it its all over before you got a chance to even enjoy it.if you are looking for this type of film watch any of the saw movies or the two hostel movie...all of which are better then this.trust me dont even rent this.i got it for $5.99 and felt cheated.a fair warning to all those considering this....DONT DO IT to yourself."
1,"My 3-year-old son loves his bed. It is sturdy and attractive. However, as other reviewers have noted, the sides and foot of the bed have edges that vary from sharp to very sharp. My son has injured himself twice, once getting a rather large cut and goose egg on his forehead, and once getting a fat bloody lip. It would be just as easy to round the edges or apply a soft molding. I can't understand why this wasn't done. Until the design is changed, I would not recommend this bed for this reason."
1,"All the cuts are so similar and so boring. There is very little passion, emotion, or personality in this CD. Honestly, next time I am out of town in a hotel, I'm leaving it for the maid.I loved Clay on American Idol. I wish he'd done the CD with ""Solitaire"", ""Buttercup"" and others from the show."
2,"It took me a few times before I could honestly give this CD a five star rating, but it is worth it. Clay is so refreshing and is filling a music void. I hope he will continue on and reach his potential as a singer. We could use a few more like him."
1,"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."
2,"I recently ordered this dress for a wedding I will soon be attending. Everything went very smoothly, it was shipped quickly, and the dress is real pretty in person. The only problem I had was the size. I went by the size chart, and the size I ordered was WAY too small. I ended up reordering the dress 2 sizes bigger than I would normally wear, and now it fits. I had no problem returning it, and receiving the new dress promptly."
1,"sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack factory. if this music is so revolutionary and worldly, how come the only people listening to it are skinny white boys who wear hats with earflaps indoors?"
2,"I think that the book ""1984"", written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions. It was a book about a man fighting for his rights only to fine out he had to give in a bit. ""1984"" was a book that captured me into its story and I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"
1,"I purchased the Pampers Baby-Dry because it advertised that it would keep baby dry for up to 12 hours - it didn't keep her dry for even a 3 hour nap. For an entire week, every single time she would wake up wet - her clothes were wet, her bed was wet, we had to change the sheets twice a day and her clothes even more. It was a disaster. We went back to using Huggies, even though they were more expensive. The time and energy we took laundering and changing everything made the price for Huggies worth it and we haven't had a problem since we switched back to Huggies."
2,"This tiny little book is the perfect companion to ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy. It is beautifully made and designed to either be something you can fit in your pocket, or put up on your wall. (It folds up nicely)I would reccommend this to anybody who has read the series or is just starting out."
1,"Boring, snoring, not in the least alluring...obvious, sophomoric and terribly uninteresting...Oh yes, and did I mention tedious ? I'm sorry, but this book was torture from beginning to end (in my humble opinion). With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards. Perserverance is not always a good or noble thing I suppose, as the time spent reading this book could have been better used in more enlightening pursuits.Similar sentiments have been expressed to much greater effect (for me)in a number ofplaces...from the Bible to the classics to poetry, music, opera etc. *JTQ"
1,"I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP."
1,"wow this cd is so heavy and brutal , the guys from cannibal corpse and slayer had to retire. i mean the lyrics are so insane the riffs so intenseafer listening to this im afraid to listen to it again cuz its so heavy!!!pantera slayer and cannibal corpse sucsk!"
1,This CD is pure crap. The songs are pitiful and shaky. Your money would be better spent on ANYTHING else besides this cd.
2,"This is a good modern take on a wonderful H.P. Lovecraft story. The claustrophobic element is great, the cinematography is good and the story keeps you entertained."
2,"This book has a clever plot, a clever story and is very, very witty. The book consists of sections of one or two pages, at most, which simultaneously tell the story, give insight on how the main character thinks, and provide a witticism of some sort. At first it annoyed me, as I prefer a more continuous prose, and the witticisms were making it hard for me to concentrate on the story. :-) But this book is so good that this soon ceased to be of any importance.This is very good science fiction. If you like science fiction in general, you'll like this book."
2,"So many clever references in this show. I love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist. It's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about JFK sleeping with ""Catherine-the-Not-So-Great"" that I get the giggles and end up watching another episode when I thought I could just watch one."
1,Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use.
2,"I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased."
2,Edward German's music evokes images of idyllic days in the English countryside. His works are not as well known as those of other English composers from the early 20th Century but you won't be disappointed if you are looking for music that raises the spirit and soothes the soul.
2,"This book changed my life. Betty Smith has become my favorite author and inspired me to read regularly again. The characters will help young women to learn to accept themselves and understand their feelings. I highly recommend this book along with all of her other books, especially Joy in the Morning."
2,"Super sound and visuals bring WWI air combat to life. For 90 years, the story of the first aces & fighter-planes has been limited to our imaginations, grainy pictures and mediocre films. Based on a true story with plenty of artistic license, Flyboys is fun to watch. An enjoyable story that puts the moviegoer in the cockpit. After watching this, you'll respect those Flyboys and be glad you weren't in the cockpit! The DVD is crisp, the audio great, the flying scenes spectacular, the story good."
1,"I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price."
2,"The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection. We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book. The book itself is, of course, a ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people. The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text."
2,"If you can ignore the stale acting by Michael J. Fox - and that's not that hard - you'll discover a terrifically powerful and wrenching Vietnam drama. More personal then most, and one of the few to offer up a believably rounded portrait of the Vietnamese. And, of course, Sean Penn is riveting. Directed by Brian DePalma, the movie has a graphic, pictorial forcefulness that recalls his work in ""The Untouchables."" Not a hit when it was released, but well worth seeking out."
1,"Oh, my was this awful. It was a desperate-to-be-different movie with corny dialogue and even cornier subplots. The characters are two dimensional and are all arrogant in one way or another(other than the maid). You just can't have a ""wacky"" and risque movie; the mediums simply don't mix as is proof in this film. I am a fan of our ArtHouse movie theater, and attend regularly, but this movie was one of the worst I've seen there. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"My acid reflux started a year ago. Whenever I lied down, my esophagus would start hurting within minutes. I tried just about all of the various acid reducing pills, both prescription and non-prescription as well as many natural remedies, with limited effect. I still woke up every hour or two at night and had to chew antacids to be able to sleep the next hour.After using this pillow for a few days my acid reflux pain disappeared and I don't need medication anymore. I place the back support pillow along the lower edge of the wedge pillow, inside the pillowcase, to elevate my rib cage. I use the neck support pillow together with a regular pillow, inside a pillowcase, to support my neck. I try to sleep as much as possible on my left side, although after a couple of weeks there was no discomfort sleeping either on my back or on my right side."
1,"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."
1,"Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."
2,"I rarely like all the songs on a single CD, but I genuinely LIKE these songs. I particularly like ""Measure of a Man"" for it's message, but moreso for the sincerity Clay puts behind it. ""Touch"" is also a favorite of mine.Clays voice and phrasing are flawless. If I had to criticize I'd have to say the production value in the music itself could be taken up a notch or two to shine as much as Clay's voice. I'm hoping Clay has more control of his second project. I'm getting my money's worth out of this CD though.If you're having a bad day or a good day just put in ""Measure of a Man"" and your day will get better."
2,"I like to purchase Pampers Diapers from Amazon. I get a much better deal for the amount. The diapers work well for our son. They aren't bulky, either. It is so nice to just order them online and have them shipped to our door for free! Less trips to the store to buy diapers is a definite plus when you have children."
2,"Clay Goes Beyond!Beyond anything you heard on AI, Clay shows his real talent. 'The Way' gave me goosebumps in the same way that his rendition of 'This is the Night' did when I first heard him sing it. Hopefully, he is hear to stay. I love his voice. If you stumble a bit on the first song, keep listening. It is the only one that is tentative in my opinion."
1,"This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."
1,"I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
2,"This book is a must read. Sister Souljah comes live and direct. Nothing sugar coated. This book is the real deal. Any black woman can probably relate to everything in this book, especially the different relationships she encounters. Go grab this book my beautiful people!"
1,This a terrible story - boring at best. I am sorry I wasted my time watching it.
1,"I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
1,"Really, this concluding novel of the Foundation series seems to belittle the original books in the series by trying to tie the Robot Universe with the Foundation.The writing is excellent, and the book is really quite interesting when taken as a stand-alone work... but it wasn't the grand end to the ""Foundation"" series that I had been hoping for."
1,"Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
2,"Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!"
2,This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.
2,This is an amazing recording that deals with spirituality and an unconditional love that we should all give to each other as humanbeings. This recording is flawless including the extras that are included on the bonus cd which includes his only Live performance of A Love Supreme as well as many outtakes which includes Archie Shepp who was a close friend and collaborator playing his screechy Sax on the alternate recordings of Acknowledgement. I think everyone should buy this recording it is very creative and innovative for 1964.
1,Yo i had this sony For about a year now and this thing is horrible it has no user friendly menus and ...it makes a whole lot of noise when it plays a tape it sounds like a vacuum cleaner when it plays tapes!! Im out!!
1,"Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality."
1,"I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual."
2,"Takes more time to cut open the box than it does to plug in. Just plug it in, hold the test button, stick your fingers in your ears so you don't do deaf, and your all done. I've used First Alert products for many years, and they just work. They do wear out (5-7 years), but they will alert you when that time comes, usually with a chirping, like other detectors do.Simple, easy to use, no fuss peace of mind unit. Plug it in near air vents in bedrooms or just in open ares for non-living quarters and that's it!"
2,"The antenna, while being a bit large, does work rather well. It is highly directional so you will have to move it around somewhat. It is styled well and sturdy. I have it sitting on top of my sat receiver and it looks good where it sits. This antenna, by the way, is built by Winegauard, a longtime American antenna company."
2,"My sense is that Baldwin wrote The Fire Next Time for anyone who had ears to hear, regardless of color or faith or gender. The emotional intelligence with which he speaks is riveting."
1,"Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson loses his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty."
1,its will cost me 100 less to get the conversion of the vhs to dvd than it would to drop 200 bills to buy this from you!!!
2,We are currently studying 1&2 Kings in our Bible Study. I bought this book for a friend for Christmas and she has already finished it and passed it on to me. I started it and have trouble putting it down. It gives an added dimension to what we are studying.
2,"I thought twice about buying this because of that horrible review... SOOOO GLAD i got this cd now! Way better music and more singing less ""talking"" (talk/singing-samples). Miss kitten shows us that she can make more than electroclash and techno beats. Other than #2 (dance) and #4 (rock)this cd is more TRIP HOP than anything. While i would never compare it to baxter or dot allison I WOULD say many of those fans might like this. Much more intelligent and sad feeling than album 1, not as dancy."
2,I am crazy about this cd. I got it today. Thanks Amazon for your quick service. My favorite songs are Perfect Day and Shine. They are brilliant songs with a beautiful message. Clay's voice soars in strength and sicerity. Don't miss this album!
2,"This album should have been great. It should have been the best album of the 1990s. However, the band doesn't seem nearly as motivated and hungry as before. Some songs are just too long, too familiar and too boring. But, songs like ""D'You Know what I mean"" and ""Fade In/Out"" among others are well done songs that feature Oasis trying to alter their musical style (albeit not by too much). Bottom line: It's great rock n' roll music. However the energy is more intense on their previous albums. It's still better than most rock music out today. Look for their next album in 2000, chances are their hunger will return and it will be one of the best albums in the last 5 years."
2,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It is well-written, clear, comprehensive, interesting, and very insightful. I learned more from this one book than from two months worth of newspapers, magazines and TV news programs. I give it my highest recommendation, and encourage every American to buy it!"
1,"After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again."
1,"Alguien me puede decir porque la serie Three's Company no viene ni con audio ni con subtitulos en ESPAOL.Esta serie fue vista a nivel mundial, si casi todas las series que salen en dvd con varios idiomas que paso con esta si es una de las mejores de todos los tiempos.Una comedia excelente y unica deberian de haber tomado en cuenta aca en mi pais la dieron con audio en espaol, donde quedo eso ???.Ahora si viene en audio ESPAOL o por lo menos subtitulo pido mil disculpas pero no dice por ningun lado en la descripcion del producto.SALUDOS"
1,"I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
2,Good movie fun and entertaining. Lots of fun if your into the simple comedy.
1,I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them. I don't know how much longer I am going to have to wait. Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you. This is ridiculous. If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you.
2,This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
2,"I found this by ""accident"", ordered it, used it and am amazed by the results. Seriously. I can't believe how quick it works. Fabulous. Thanks to the author for sharing this with us. I know there's more to it than just one book, but nevertheless, it works."
1,"Do you like to read about WWII? Then I think you will like this book. In Summer of my German Soldier, Patty meets Anton Reiker, a German Soldier (Prisoner Of War). Patty risks her life for Anton by hiding him in their garage. Anton risks his life for Patty when her father is beating her. Patty goes to a reformatory for girls when the FBI finds out she was hiding Anton. Patty will always remember him, because he loved her in a way her parents never will.I gave this book one star. I did not like this story, because it was hard for me to read and understand. I did not like the way her father always beats her for little things she does like sitting and talking with Freddy a poor boy in the neiborhood that she is friends with. Her family doesn't love her enough except for Ruth, their black maid, & Sharon, her little sister."
2,"This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,"" which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the ""happy ending"" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."
1,Every single night my 11 month old daughter would wet through these diapers and get her sheets completely wet! HORRIBLE buy in my opinion!
1,"My dog also chewed one of the straps, and the halti is now useless. Be aware that you have to closely watch your dog when you use the halti to make sure he is not chewing it. I was very surprised to find the halti ruined when I took it off of my dog because I was less than 3 feet away the entire time he wore it."
2,"This has to one of the best books i have ever read. It shows us what the world would be like if governments obtained complete power over the populace. It makes one think, and if you are not ready for how it makes you think then you may find it long and boring. Give it a chance though, you'll be rewarded."
2,"This book is amazing. I read it when I was a child and couldn't put it down. It has amazing adventure and suspense, without the horrible violence. Several months ago, something reminded me of the book and I had to hunt it down. I had forgotten the title and the author(it had been 15 years since I read it). I finally was able to locate it. I was thrilled. I bought it and read it in just a couple of hours. It is a book I recommend for both children and adults."
2,"Steinbeck's book Of Mice and Men is one of the most incredible works of American literature. It's a story about how two men try to achieve some semblance of success in Depression-era California. However, all of their hopes and dreams are shattered by the people around them. This is a must-read."
1,This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
2,This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Cudos to Kent. My favorite part is the final cut by underground artist Jula Bell. I was so pleased to hear her singing on something like this. Cheers to Kent for having the guts to take a chance with someone who is a truly cutting edge artist known for her integrity. I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his. It's simplicity and bold melody is the heart and soul of the soundtrack. Why wasn't this song in the movie? Buy this cd to hear one of the best female vocalists out there---
1,"These replacement pads are smaller than the originals, so they don't ""hook"" under the edges and when a cat gets their claw in it, it flies out of the scratcher. Useless!"
1,I have not read any of the authors other titles but I decided to try this from the good reviews. I felt that it lacked pace until the last quarter of the book and found myself skimming through pages just to find something of relevance to the plot. The technical detail was informative but didn't really add to the story. I couldn't wait to finish it and start something else. Really quite dull in my opinion.
2,"I'm sorry I didn't find this sooner. Its awesome. The liner notes were priceless as well. They tell the story of high school music teacher and his brother leaving Florida, landing in New York, and playing in clubs with the greats like Hampton, Coltrane, and Miles Davis. Meanwhile making a name for themselves. Great album."
2,"WOW! Thank you for this wonderful cd! I truly enjoy listening to Measure Of A Man so much!!! Excellent cd, looking forward to Solitaire coming out with The Way in late January!!! A+"
2,"this book rocks, people! however, i got reali confused withnyala's character. what's up with her aniway? split personality?aniway, i reali loved rashel and quinn though they were always at each other's throats!! enjoy this book! p.s : if u're reading these reviews to decide whether it's worth ur money, i tell ya, get it QUICK before it's all gone!"
2,This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses. It also offers great support for your back. It is perfect for everyday wear.
2,"1984 by George Orwell is a story of a totalitarian government and a man living under its power. Winston, the main character, struggles to fight the ruling outer party, even though his works for them changing historical documents to fit the parties needs. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys conspiracy stories. The only negative thing I can say about this book is it becomes slow in some parts, but over all it is a great read."
1,"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
1,"With 3 grandchildren, I've tried many disposable diapers and my daughter and I feel that Pampers does not, in our opinion, measure up to Huggies."
1,"This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."
2,"For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!"
2,This was the greatest movie! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!
1,"I'm never a nasty person, and I know that on his day Noel Gallagher writes not just classic songs like Cigarettes and Alcohol but whole albums of them like Definitely Maybe. But PLEASE! This was so mind-numbingly awful that by the time I got to the eighth track I wanted to (JOKING!!!!) get that guitar and WRAP IT ROUND HIS NECK! It was that bad. Even the stand-out tracks Stand By Me and Be Here Now are pitiful copies of their earlier songs like Married With Children and Shakermaker. The rest - well.....do you really fancy hearing ""Wonderwall"" twelve times every time you put the album on?If there had been a category lower than one star it would have more accurately described my reaction to this album."
2,"Mr. Steibeck has managed to write an exelent novel,""Of mice and men"".The novel has a very interesting layout, and it deals with some aspects that are familiar to us in every moment of our lives; lonelyness, authority, dreams, and friendship are the main ones. The book has also a very good and interesting relationship between the main characters, George and Lennie.I think that their relationship is the main plot of the story,but the shocking part is George's last action. I would recomend this book to a teenager because it teaches us how to afront our problems."
1,"Being a camera aficionado and collector, I picked this up at Walmart to play around with. Even THAT'S not possible... see, there's no support for Mac OS X. Vivitar's website claims no driver is needed for OS X, that an icon appears on the desktop in Classic Mode. That's a cynical, damnable LIE! Until some similarly-wronged Code Warrior writes a driver for this, I can't affirm to you that the dynamic range of this sweetheart sucks eggs, but that's what I've been told.It really deserves negative stars. I used to love Vivitar SLR stuff. Now they don't even answer email inquiries and complaints. Vivitar should be cast into the deepest pit of Hell for all eternity."
1,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, and when she heard it burp and fart she couldn't belive it. She said she wants to take it back because it's so grose."
1,"Too much swearing! Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting"
2,This item was like new as advertised an easy to set up with the instructions. We are so thrilled to have gotten a perfectly good dual tuner TiVo at a fraction of the normal cost!
2,"He's our favorite dog to read about! Any book about Clifford is a hit with my 3.5 year old grand daughter. The 5 month old loves the bright ""red"" dog as well!"
2,Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center.
1,"Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."
2,"I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
1,"found this a very weird book,just couldn't get going with it..maybe it was the translation..I might try again soon"
2,"This is the best diaper so far i have used. Not too thick like Huggies, no plastic feeling like Luv. wonderful."
1,"I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."
2,Thisd just is the key text of 20th century philosophy. Written in aphoristic style and heavily reactive to the conversation between Frege Russell and the early Wittgenstein that gave birth to contemporary analytic philosophy it is a must read (in company with some of the texts from those three authors). Nobody should remain unchanged in their thinking by reading and striving to understand this work.
2,"I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read."
1,"Just finished watching this movie and the best thing about it is it finally ended.Slow, boring, and extremely gory with uninteresting characters tied to a script filled with cliches. That about does it except if you're having trouble sleeping do watch it since it's a wonderful cure for insomnia."
1,"I own the Zen Xtra, thought this was a upgrade, wrong, this unit functions like the ipod, no search function, poor screen vision and after 2 hours it froze had to remove battery to reboot. not what you expect from creative labs"
1,"My son loves the appearance of the shoe, but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description:-leather-Soft, calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper. I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising."
2,"Yep, there are a lot of ""dream shops"" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are ""monitarilly challenged"". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."
2,"I bought this puzzle for my son because we can't afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC's, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I have nearly every educational puzzle that Melissa and Doug have put out and I love them all."
1,The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.
1,"Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format."
1,"If, according to the editorial review, you either desire to lavish the director of this picture with affection or to slap him silly, I advocate the latter. An amateurish attempt to lend some ""hipper than thou"" gloss to a mediocre plotline. Even the actors themselves seem uninspired by the material. Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."
2,"After years of seclusion, most of the secrets of, by and about Bettie Page are revealed in this well-composed and long overdue profile of the most photographed model in history.Ms. Page may still wonder at the inspiration and sensation (and consternation from members of Congress) she caused in the mid-1950's...what this book clearly does, is testify as to why her image is still sought after by fans and collectors.Easy, lively reading and plenty of pictures rates this as the best book available on the Page rage."
2,"In my German class, one boy brought this movie in. I really didn't know what to expect, because most movies we see in German class are a bit old.. this one is very different, and creative. I have never seen anything so different, and imaginative. It is very well done, and interesting. Nothing that anyone should miss seeing."
1,very badly sized and can't return it since I washed it before trying it on
1,"With it's demented make-up, acting and (of cource) soundtrack, FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER remains pure, talky trash. Dr. Frank (Frank, Frankenstein, GET IT) is a scientist who wants a daughter and (suprise! suprise!),he kills off one of the film's bitchy charactor's and turns her into a hideous looking monster. For a long time I've been a fan of trash cinema, I've even written a book about it and I found this one pretty hard to take and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Still, if FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER appears on late-night TV, it's worth staying up for.....just to see how bad it is!"
2,"I loved ""The Dazzle of Day"" and now I love ""The Jump-Off Creek"". Molly Gloss is a wonderful writer. The images are evocative, the characters ring true, the plot is interesting and engrossing. My only criticism is the frequency with which she describes ""smiles"" (slow, deliberate, flat, purposefully, gently, etc.) -- it got a bit distracting. But that's a small criticism. Molly Gloss: write more, faster!"
1,"I really don't see what the previous reviews are raving about. Here is a summary of the ideas in this book, 1.) go the extra mile 2.) use your mastermind. And ""mastermind"" is bascially to cooperate with people. Thats all. The rest just seemed like a lot of worthless ramblings. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because at least these two ideas are worthwhile but the book isn't."
2,This is a very good Van Damme movie. It is not his best movie. But I would have to say it was his best acting. Great action scenes.
1,"Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems..."
1,"If you love meaningless running around, plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief, andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies, you might put up with this one. Otherwise . . . the book disappoints. One gets the impression that it was written in haste. A pale imitation of the previous work . . .deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables (if not in a Potter's Field for books)."
2,"I never read Orwell in school for some reason and I am glad I waited. I can't believe this was written in the late 40's. O'Brien's descriptions of seeking power for power's sake and the mutability of truth and history have never been more applicable to current events. Reading this book now, you really start to feel like this must be on Karl Rove's desk."
2,"This diaper is the cheapest brand name diapers I can find when you buy them in bulk and use Amazon's subscription program. It works great for my now 6 month old. He started out with swaddlers when he was a newborn. I switched to baby-dry when he turned 3 month. This diaper barely leaks. Only time it leaked was when he slept too long and I forgot to change him when he got fed once. It was over 12hrs, so I'm sure no other diaper could do any better.Some might not agree this is not the cheapest, but when I was searching for new diaper, this Economy pack for subscription price was the cheapest (per diaper price). I even compared with other brands and from stores like Sam's club. It is really convenient to use subscription service for diaper. I don't have to go to the store, and if I don't need one on certain month, I can just skip that month's shippment."
2,"WOW ! Batman has finally arrived on the big screen.This movie really deserves a sixth star for sending all previous versions to an early retirement and hopefully their final resting place.Try to forget all the goofy,spoofy and fluffy batman movies of the past - this one finally tells the story the way it was intended, dark with realism so long over-due that it will have you believing in heroes again. A must see movie that will entertain adults as well as children. I was absolutely convinced that Christian Bale is Batman - SUPERB !Buy it!!!"
1,"This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff."
2,"I had this book in paperback and just HAD to buy it on my Kindle so I'd have it wherever I went.I've loved this story ever since I picked it out of my mom's bookshelf back home. It's filled with love, strength, and just enough fantasy to keep me dreaming.Love this book."
2,"What a pleasure to read such a high-quality book... It introduces each of the islands in a colorful and vivid way. The book includes many pictures, and provides a fine insight into the culture and character of the islands and touches on history, people, travel, activities, sights, nature, and a lot more.However, if you are looking for a book with accurate travel information, e.g. hotels, restaurants, prices/dates, how to get there, etc., this book is on the weaker side. Use it together with the Frommer's Caribbean guide for a combination that is hard to beat. Despite this weakness, it's still a five star on my bookshelf."
2,"This is the best show, historically, that I have seen in the last couple of years. This is in regards to TV shows. I love the chemistry between Dennis Quad & Jason O'Mara (as native Nevada / Las Vegas) and Michael Chiklis (as the Mobster). This is one of my favorite shows."
2,"I wasn't sure this was spec'd for my G3 IBook, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. I'm hoping it'll be a backup for my G4 Powerbook too. It works fine. Seems to load up my battery as quickly as the original AC adapter; it's lighter and seems to be more compactable -- easier to carry around. I'd recommend it."
2,looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
2,"This movie is probably my favorate action/adventure movie. with a great plot, story line and special effects, It needs no long reveiw. I canot wait for this DVD. It's so great, it needs no introduction. It needs no special features ^_^... not."
1,"When I attempted to install the mirror onto my pickup, the three screws came unthreaded from the housing, which means that I cannot tighten the mirror to my pickup."
2,"fantastic rice and oatmeal. the only problem i've encountered is that there is no ""steamer tray"" - i mention because ""the ultimate rice cooker cookbook"" has recipes that use a steamer tray - whatever. i wasn't planning on that to begin with but might be helpful if available in a fancier zojirushi. the other consideration is capacity. it's ok for me because there are just two of us, but this size could be wrong for you if you have kids and want leftovers. (i get sick of the same meal after two days and that's usually all i get in terms of leftovers - perfect!) this machine is worth it's weight in gold for oatmeal alone. incredibly easy to use and to clean. i'm reviewing because other reviewers helped me make my decision and now it's my turn."
2,"This book answers hard questions regarding God and our existance in a way that is very racional. I could not find one thing that didn't have a logical explanation regarding the spiritual way of looking at things. It is bealtiful, positive, and only talks about love. It has helped me see life in a different way and respect God's work. I learned that he is in charge at all times, protecting us, and will give us eternal life. This knowledge will help you cope better with every day life issues, tragedies, etc. I hope everyone in the world would read this book and live accordingly, which will happen with time."
2,i have read this book over and over. it never bores meno matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live inpoliticians never change and always practice the art of deception.people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely
2,"I am 65 years old and have been running for about 40 years. When I was younger I never had to worry about injuries. With age they became more frequent, which led to my interest in this book. While it is too early to tell whether applying the concepts will totally eliminate injuries, I can say that the concepts are sound. I can also say that now when I finish a run my legs feel fresh; while in the past they felt strained. With each day that I learn to more fully incorporate the principles of Chi running into my form I feel better and better both during and after the run.I nice ripple effect is that one can apply the principles of Chi running into other aspects of one's life: for example, the posture which the book describes should be practiced at all times: not just when running.This book is a must for anyone who likes to run or even walk."
1,"This book initially seemed like it would be a great read. It promised black lesbian characters/story set in a different time (the late-50s/early 1960s...I'm not sure why the previous reviewer said early 1900s/1920s Harlem Renaissance). In actuality any lesbian content could be compiled into about 2-3 pages out of the entire book (which was a disappointment for me). Further none of the characters, including the main character Sunshine/Kali, were likable. The author did not make me feel for any of them, except perhaps briefly at the very end.To the author's credit it was well written, though the multiple storylines that did not come together until the end got annoying."
2,I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great. I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life.Too bad it's not possible to pickup/hangup without connecting a headset lifter (lame).
2,"I have read all the reviews, but did not write until I read Jaan's review. All I can say to the so called music critics and Jaan, GET OVER IT, Clay is here to stay. It was very obvious from Jaan's review that he/she is a fan of ?????? and someone wants to hurt sales of Clay's upcoming new release.Measure of a Man is wonderful because you can actually understand the words and the range of Clay's voice is incredible. I agree with other reviewers that MOAM gets better the more you listen to it.Clay is a powerful singer as shown in the duet with Ruben on the AMA's. They were the only singers to get a standing ovation from their peers.My favorites are I survived you, and Touch"
1,"Some people may have no issues with these diapers, however, my little girl probably leaks in these once a day if not multiple times. I've tried everything making sure that the diaper is on just right or immediately changing her when I ""hear"" her go. NOTHING WORKS - I change her outfit multiple times a day and not for the fun of it. So it is back to Swaddlers for us.....I don't know why I ever changed."
1,"This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money."
2,I love being able to buy the big pack of economy pack plus diapers. When i buy them that means i dont have to go to the store every week to buy diapers!
1,"Dumb and unsatisfying horror movie that is made worse by the terrible acting of Keanu Reeves, who is extremely miscast in his role. The rest of the film is almost as bad as Reeves's performance with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a great performance thou out despite the movie horrible script and crappy special effects. I would have paid to see her character in a more serious and better horror film than the garbage that is here.The one star review is for Weisz, for at least giving a great performance despite the huge shortcomings of this film. Too bad that she was not the lead instead of Keanu Reeves."
2,"I love this album so much. the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because while I totally absolutely love some of the songs on it there are some which leave me a bit dissapointed. For example ""You've been Flirting Again"" and ""Headphones"" etc but I LOVE ""Army of Me"", ""Hyper-ballad"", ""Enjoy"", ""It's Oh So Quiet"", ""I Miss You"" , ""Isobel"" and others. I definately recommend it if you're tired of the mainstream stuff they play on the radio and are looking for something different. Bjork's voice is just amazing. I don't know too many people who can sound that good when they wail =)"
2,"im in love with chucks.i love black and these are my fav, i match them with everything and they always feel comfortable.i cant wear them a lot on the summer cus they burn my feet but other than that, nothing better than my chucks"
2,"I think this is one of the better values for r-ALA. But the powder in my caps are slightly hard due to moisture/humidity getting into the caps. Not to big of a deal, can't roll out the hardness with my fingers. So had to use a few wacks with the back edge of a knife to break it up a bit so I could roll it out with my fingers.First time that happened, but various supplements are prone to humidity. Can't comment on its effectiveness? Just going with the available online research. Seems like a good antioxidant."
2,"If you worry about how much you pay for gas, read this book! END"
2,"The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter."
1,"This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."
1,"Something in this brand gives my kid a rash. The rash is not wetness related, but seems to be from something in the band of the diaper."
2,"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars."
2,"For years now, whenever I'm in a contemplative mood, this has been one of my favorite ""go to"" albums. These rich, harmonic melodies will help you relax without having to suffer the banalities of ""muzak."""
1,"This album has got to be the most boring, unimaginative CD of the year. All of these five-star reviews are very misleading. I feel that most of them have been written by obsessed Clay fans who feel the need to heap praise on Measure Of A Man simply because ""It's Clay!!!"" Don't be misled! I wouldn't recommend buying this record for anyone as Christmas gift, unless you are trying to make an enemy. A better gift idea would be Speakerboxxx/The Love Below by Outkast, or Elephant by The White Stripes. Merry Un-Clay Christmas!"
1,"This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail."
2,"I can't get enough of this marvelous CD. I have to admit I play it over and over again, every day. It is mesmerizing.To those who say the album does not reflect this singer (i.e., he is not a song writer so he doesn't know squat), I say WHO CARES? How many artists out there today actually write their own songs and have lived every word of them?? To naysayers who do not believe a good singing voice makes an artist, well, I think there are about two million people out there who would tend to disagree with that assumption!!I have news for all of you doubters. This IS real music; music that has been sorely missing from the airwaves for years. So,you'd better get used to it - Clay is here to stay.AND I, FOR ONE, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS MUSIC AS LONG AS HE CHOOSES TO GRACE US WITH HIS REFRESHING STYLE AND MARVELOUS VOCAL ABILITIES!Buy Measure of a Man and see for yourself what REAL SINGING is!"
2,I first saw this back in 2005. I watched it again. The story line never drug it's feet. It was interesting plot and unfolded well. I like Keanu Reeves. He played this part well.
1,"A TON of the quotes in this book are religious in nature--whether they be bible verses, quotes about ""god in christ,"" about faith, praying, etc, etc! As an Atheist, I didn't appreciate having so many religious quotes in what is billed as just a book of quotes on ""Wisdom."" And they aren't only in one section of the book, but ALL OVER--in the sections about art, nature, love and friendship, conscience, etc! I feel like a ""bait and switch"" was pulled on me, and that this book should be advertised as a religious quote book. So I'd say buy it if you're religious and draw your inspiration from religion, but not if you aren't/don't."
1,"While this book is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. If this book were to be shared with people of non-Mormon faiths, they would become very defensive and rightly so. The author's invective toward the Catholic faith is appaling. Many Mission Presidents do not recommend this book. It could be dangerous in the hands of the untrained."
2,"I learned about the story of the Essex in researching my family history. Captain George Pollard, Matthew Joy and Owen Coffin are all distant relations. Philbrick does an excellent job taking the reader along on this fateful, dark journey. This is a grim, harrowing story and it's hard to read. However, I came away amazed and respectful of the courage these men demonstrated- especially the young Owen Coffin. I also appreciate Philbrick's sensitivity. When things get pretty dismal, Philbrick relieves the reader by interjecting educational explanations for what is happening and why. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nantucket history, Moby Dick or inspirational stories of human courage and perseverance. The sea is not for the timid!"
2,"My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan. This book, although she read it for school, she loved it. We read it once every 2 weeks, she now has certain lines memorized and loves to read it with me."
1,"I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
2,I like Kari Anderson her fun nature laughing while exercising It feels good her queues are easy to follow I have just started to do the step and find it enjoyable.
1,"This movie was not restored! It is the same quality and sound as the DVD I purchased from the dollar bin at WalMart several years ago! What a disappointment! I would like to return it, but I am guessing that since the bluray is open Amazon will not take it back. The special feature lasts one minute tops. I can't understand why they would release one of the best movies of all time in such terrible condition."
2,"The film has a nice flow and plot. The music is great. It is all geared toward the Italian familia. I love Cher, Nicholas Cage, and Olivia Dukacas in it. They gave great performances. I already loved La Boheme prior to seeing the movie and bought the CD of the movie soundtrack. Anyone wanting to see an enjoyable movie and listen to great music should put this high on your list. It is entertaining and holds your interest, unlike a lot of other movies. It used to be a 4-star movie and is now rated a 3-star movie - but a high 3-star. It is a classic that will be viewed over and over. The music of Puccini will live forever. Once you see the movie, the music flows from scene to scene in your mind.A must buy CD."
1,"This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight."
1,"This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
2,"I had to read this book for my summer reading before I went to the 9th grade. I thought that it would be a drag reading it because it was so long, but I didn't really take a long finishing the book. I liked this book because it was very realistic. I could fit right in with Francie. Even though the story took place in the early 1900's, I felt that it could've took place today. I felt an instant connection with Francie once I picked up the book"
2,"This is an excellent book, which used to be the basis for the League of American Wheelmen (now the League of American Bicyclist's) safe cycling class (at the time known as Effective cycling. Learn all the critical skills for riding safely in traffic, including such things as emergency stops and emergency turns (i.e. when a car ""hooks"" you by making a right turn in front of you).This book has been around for a long time, restructured and revised in this 6th edition, it's a much better read -- I just wish John could give up on his political ranting (correct as much of it is) and spend some time on riding safely in the world of bike lanes, etc. rather than wishing they didn't exist -- sadly, given legislative ignorance such things are here to stay and every cyclist should know how to use them safely!"
1,"This was a handy device which worked nicely to trim nose and ear hairs on this aging head. But after one year of not that frequent use it just died. Until it died, I did enjoy it. It's a bit pricey for 12 months of use."
1,"Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!"
2,"works great! so easy to use with ""click to DVD"" software that came on my Sony Vaio PC. love it! I can finally have my home videos put on DVD easily, in about an hour or so."
2,"Nice high quality ball. The pump isn't great, but better than I feared based on other reviews. It did the job. Ball is true to size."
2,"It's said that ""The first ones to cry for revolution are also the first ones to be lined up against the wall & shot after the Revolution overthrows the prior regime."" This book is a representation of this truism. Many of the participants were eaten up in the maw of the revolutionary machine that they themselves created. The author himself, by the way, was killed on orders from Stalin (with an alpine ice axe, to boot) while in exile in Mexico. A good read & a cautionary tale for anyone considering starting a revolution. ""Beware the Committee for Public safety & the Guillotine! The Revolution will swallow its own!If you can get through this book, you might also want to check out ""1905"", also by Leon Trotsky."
1,"if sparta actually makes a good album i'll give all my mars volta material away. they lack any kind of creative thinking or flow in there music. they continue to try and re-hash the spirit of atdi.......zzzzzzzzzzz. not gonna happen.listen we all know mars isn't for everyone, but collectivly they are changing music,taking risks and devolping a new style of fusion... writing and putting together such timeless concept albums takes skill... also to have complete control over there music??? how many artists can say that? sparta take notice... try something new.. weak songwriting and catchy pop hooks will only take that atdi recognition so far"
2,"This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five..."
2,"I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"After listening and falling in love with recordings by Richter, I went back and re-listened to Barenboim's version...I couldn't recognize the piece. None of the phrasing and feeling. The beauty and feeling was completely stripped away, leaving only the notes..."
1,"While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
1,"With the over 50 GIGS of memory on a Blu-Ray, Paramount could easily fit the first 11 or 12 TV Specials on one disc, but being the crooks they are, they prefer to screw the American consumer by retailing 29.99 for ONE 25 minute episode, one 12 minute interview and a sub par ""Christmas Special"" made 20 years AFTER the original masterpiece. Shameful."
2,"Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time. How? By blending 70% store-bought ingredients with 30% fresh foods to produce the taste of homemade. Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter."
2,"This may have been written for professional military scholars and experts, but it is also of immense value to amateurs and military buffs. This is solid, heavy going but deeply analytical and more informative than any other book on the subject. It ranks alongside Ziemke and Bauer, David Glantz, and John Erickson (who have written a stunning review of it) as a top Stalingrad book."
2,"Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat."
2,"I don't understand how Amazon.com can allow ""reviews"" with vulgarities and obvious intentions to slam the artist rather than reviewing the cd, to be posted. Is this how Amazon.com wants to be portrayed? Trashy because it allows trashy ""reviews"" to be posted. This is outright irresponsibility especially when children may visit this site!Why does Amazon.com even bother to state ""Please be sure to focus your comments on the album's content. Read our review guidelines for more information"" when it isn't responsible enough to check before it allows posts of this dispicable nature to be put up. I am deeply disappointed!Having said all that Clay's Measure of a Man is an excellent cd and no intentional slams of Clay or his cd will make fans of Clay to change their minds. In fact, I know of many people who are not even fans of Clay and they love this cd. A great cd is a great cd, period."
1,"I bought these shirts for $6 each thinking that I've got a bargain, but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase. As previous reviewers mentioned, the material is flimsy, 60% cotton - 40% polyester (and feel like the latter), the fit is improper and finish poor. Am wearing one of the shirts now, and it wears uncomfortably (feels like a poorly made medical scrub) and looks just as cheap (yes, even the French Blue color). Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet."
1,"Hello peoples. I recomend not to read this book. As other readers have stated... it was very boring and 500 pages saying "" my life ..."" so you can read this book if you dont already know that life can .... if you dont know that, you should definitly read this book!!! i repeat... this book is very boring... and i dont recomend it!!!!"
1,"I love the Crowes -- best band of the '90's. However, I'm still riding the euphoria of ""Southern Harmony"" and ""Amorica"". ""By Your Side"" is so trite. The lyrics are sometimes ""goofy"", and mostly simplistic. One song even has ""na, na, na"" in it. You almost can't believe that the same band that turned out the above mentioned classics, with their soulful guitar, dynamite lyrics, and truly ""classic"" appeal, could produce this latest effort. It seems like they just ""whipped it out in a hurry"". Come on guys. Listen to some Zeppelin for a few hours. Watch the Woodstock movie. Even spark it up, if you have to. Then give us something that you'll be proud of in 10 years -- something they'll still play on the radio."
2,"Not a weak note in Menotti's score. I try to see a local production every Christmas. The music is so superb, I cherish amateur performances. The tech is dated, but it is beautiful from start to finish."
1,"Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
2,Love ordering these from amazon! It's so simple and easy! It's great not having to run to the store to get diapers - these are delivered right to my door! What could be better than that?
2,A story of hope - from a lost cause to glorious circumstances. It affirms the view that in life there are second chances for us to take and change our circumstances
1,"This book puts me to sleep with its extremely large print and outdated stories. Writer goes on and on and wasn't at all what I expected by all the rave reviews. I'd much rather read Wesley the Owl, Marley and Me, Dewey the Library Cat, or Merle's Door. Save your money if you want to still read this and just check it out from the library."
2,"THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from ""New Age"" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism. This book is a MUST READ for any serious student of the origins and practices of Gnostic Philosophy.Gospel of Judas and Other Gnostic Secrets Revealed"
2,"This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought ""women's literature"" books for my book club!"
1,"the songwriting is so below average; i'm finding it incredibly hard to believe that all of you people are buying it. you've been brainwashed by clive davis and his cronies at RCA. can't you see they're selling american idol, not clay aiken the singer. this is by far the best selling below average pop album in years. overpriced songwriters wrote the songs, overpriced producers produced the music and you're all fools for buying into this trite, vanilla music. shame on you."
1,"Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again."
2,"Cynical and cold story about a 'Benefactor', who creates together with his lackeys a state of totally depersonalized citizens: conscience is a disease, cruelty is a sign of love, without liberty no crimes can be committed, sex is planned ...The precursor of George Orwell's '1984' and, more, of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World', for the novel lacks the 'human' touch of '1984'. It remains more or less abstract, although it contains scenes worth a Bunuel.A book to recommend."
2,Enjoyed this book very much. Realy got to know the people in this book am looking forward to reading the second book
2,"To Pearl Jam Lion, I really don't appreciate being threanted withmy life because I like a particular artist, or a different typeof music that is obviously not the music you enjoy.It is peoplesuch as yourself that help make this a more freightening planet.So I have forwared your ""review"" to the Center for Hate Crimes asa possible person to watch. I also forwared it to the Center forPeople with Eratic and unusual Behavior. There is also an agencyfor terroristic threats by person or by proxy, especially overthe internet. So I am glad you got printed and you have yourselfa nice little day."
1,"The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know."
2,I REALL LIKE THIS SONG....VERY CATCHY IN WORDS AS WELL AS MUSIC.MY FAVORITE VERSIONS ARE:THE FULL INTENTION MIXES!GRAB A COPY...WELL WORTH IT!
1,"I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore."
2,I love Pampers Baby Dry! I have found I have less leaks with these diapers. They are very sturdy! I have used the Pampers Baby Dry on all my children. What is so great about them? they do last that 12 hours like it says on the box during the night. I do find them running a little smaller then other types of pampers though.
2,It's another one of Smallville's excellent seasons. Highly recommendable for any fan of the series.
1,"Trick or Treat sounded like a great book from the blurb on the cover, What I found was vile and disgusting. I kept reading thinking it must get better. But no. It never got better. What I found was that the ending proved how really poorly written this book is--the author had multiple threads going. At the end, she dealt with none of them and ended on an improbability that only left more improbabilities. This is the only book I've ever consigned straight to the trash."
2,"I bought this to replace a 13"" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase."
2,"This book by Gregg Braden is fantastic in the best possible way. It is packed with answers that make sense. I had originally borrowed the book from my spiritual teacher, and I had to remove many sticky notes that I had used to mark important information when I returned it, months late. I had no choice but to get my own copy. I will re-read this a number of times, and I have returned to select passages many times already. Thank you Gregg, for sending this information out into this world!"
2,"A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."
2,"Just because a critic doesn't like a movie and has to vent his/her opinion on it, does not mean that the entire movie-going public has to hate it either. Not many critics liked Wild, Wild, West, but I, and many other people enjoyed it. Same with a smile like yours. If at times it became hokey or even suggestive, it doesn't matter because in my view it was very well done and meaningful. It shows what people are willing to do for love because of how powerful love truly is. When the gynecologyst put that huge, curved instrument into Lauren Holly's nether-region, that took love on her character's part."
1,"Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage."
1,"If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting."
1,"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept."
2,"I've know Johnny France since he was a young man. Without his dogged determination, these two killers might not have ever been captured. Don Nichols is still in prison and most likely will never get paroled. This book tells fascinating tale almost too strange to believe in these modern times. Great reading!!"
2,"I used the emu oil faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits. Very fine lines vanished (really!) and deeper lines diminished noticeably. My husband even commented on the difference. Further, my complexion is pinkish from rosacea, and the emu oil took some (not all) of the pink from my skin. Finally, the skin on my cheeks had been inexplicably rough as well, and the emu oil smoothed my skin. This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims."
2,Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching.
2,"Been using these for the past 6 mos. My gums have always bled cause I only flossed before going to the dentist (about every 6 mos or so), regular floss never really worked me, my teeth were too close together. The last visit my dentist said my gums were getting inflamed and was getting the periodontal thing. I researched alternatives to the floss and found these, also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash. My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there. These could be a little more sturdy on the brush end of them as I have had a few bend and had to throw out but that's a few out of 250 which isn't bad. My next dentist appt is in a month so i'll see what they say. Hopefully they'll say , wow!"
2,"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of many of Adam Sandler's movies. I thought he was funny on ""Saturday Night Live"" but I find many of his movies dissappointing. Some I find just not good (""Zohan"") while others I find good for a while then they lose steam.(""Chuck & Larry"", ""Click"" ""Spanglish"") Most of his movies I'll find some funny or amusing bits but not enough to sustain a whole movie. I keep watching Sandler movies and finally I've found one that is very good from start to finish.""50 First Dates""_is a very good movie with a clever premise, a good script and a good supporting cast, especially leading lady Drew Barrymore. I've liked some of his other films (""Big Daddy"" ""Bedtime Stories"") but not as much as this one. It shows that given a good script, Sandler can make good movies. A very solid 4 stars here."
1,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
1,"I have owned for the past 2 years the 1753 Whistler. The 1773 I just purchased gives numerous false alarms, during an alarm, the unit jumps between K and KA band voice warnings, and this is in the most filtered City 2 mode. I can't say I recommend this unit. Although this model was more expensive than most others I have seen and used, it is not as good a performer."
2,"The proof of a book on health issues is in the results it gets you, and it's very hard to argue with the results I've gotten from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. Many others have reviewed this book more capably than I can, but let me just say that after a few months of following Dr. B's diet, I've lost 50 lbs., gotten normal blood sugars, and feel better than I've felt in years. Highly recommended!"
2,"You can't like electric guitar and not love this CD. It's smooth, jazzy, and bluesy all at the same time. If you liked the music in the film ""Bull Durham"" you'll be in heaven."
2,"I have been using a candle warmer for about 5 years and it finally gave out. Didn't really keep my coffee hot but was ok. This coffee warmer is hotter than the candle warmer but not hot enough to burn. Keeps my coffee at the desired temp and keeps me happy. I love it. Bought 3 so I could have one in the bedroom, one in the den and one in the living room. :) If you want to keep your coffee warm then this is what you need."
2,"I really liked this book! It is a Classic ""Rinaldi"". I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of ""dark"". It is not a real ""happy"" book to read although it is very good."
1,What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
2,"One of the LONGEST books I have ever read in light of number of pages, subject and time it took to read. But one of the most beautiful ""poetry/prose"" books ever written. I feel wonderful having finished it!"
2,"a gift for my friend he loved it is a child movie and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping"
2,"Love them. They work well on my long, moderately skinny baby. They are my go-to disposable. I probably won't order them again since we're switching to cloth full time."
2,If you're a fan of the prodigy already you'll definitely like this single. I don't know why people are putting it down so much though I do agree just as with Firestarter Kieths vocals do get annoying which is why the instrumental version is a must. My only criticism is that htis single is exaclty just what you'd expect and nothing different.. hopefully we'll hear a new sound from the prodigy with the release of their upcoming album.
1,"rotten to the core , rotten to the core , rotten to the core and oh yes, did i say ROTTEN TO THE CORE !!!!"
2,"Long you have resisted to Kylie, longer than anyone else on the Planet, but the rocking Krafterwerkish ""La, la, la, la"" will sneak behind you and get into your head. It's shall indeed make all the world move. It just must, it is so damn good. Enjoy Kylie, she's back to make Americans unable to get her out of their heads!!!"
2,"Great toy, well made, good for learning, bu c'mon, $20 + bucks is too much for this type of toy."
2,"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."
2,"We had 1 Tivo Premere DVR and it was time to get a second one. I bought it and then ordered this item. When it arrived, I hooked it up quickly and with no problems. Using this allows us to tape a show on one Tivo box and then transfer it to the other box for viewing in our choice of rooms. Great product!"
1,"This title, Moonstruck (BlueRay) is not widescreen , as advertised, nor are there any special features. Amazon's return policy is quite cumbersome, so I didn't bother to return it assuming a replacement would be the same. Things such as this are becoming more common with Amazon as is my dissatisfaction. They could easily lose this customer who makes about 100 purchases a year."
2,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I could not believe the price I picked this CD up for - very reasonable.
2,"Let's be honest here. You buy this product for one reason only; to see your baby in it for 5 minutes before you strip it from her and have some fun.This product worked, it looks fabulous on her body, it really frames her buns perfectly and her DDs look fantastic in it as well. She managed to keep it on her body for 30 minutes...I was tied up!You will love this body stocking."
1,"RoboCop 3 was a show I strongly anticipated. I expected a continuation of Robo 2: The evil mistress in prison possibly teaming up with a revived Clarence Boddicker from Robo 1. They somehow get out and terrorize Detroit. Who knows? Could be far fetched but I thought the ending of 2 was a good setup for 3. Instead, we've got a boring bad guy with an English accent and a show with nothing I could find to get interested in. The diabolic, sinister Boddicker in 1 and Cain in 2 are replaced by some bad guy wanna be. I even gave my #3 away its so bad."
2,"I think that this is a great album. My personal favorite song on it is ""Like I Love You."" Probably the most popular song on it is ""Takes a little time."" My friend is crazy about that song! You should buy this CD!"
2,"If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
1,"This movie was a bore. The first 45 minutes was a lot of philosophy/psychology mumbo-jumbo about the journey and ""fear is not fear if it's fear"" or some such nonsense. The action scenes were frenetic and hard to follow as in who was fighting whom. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were good additions to the cast, but following the plot was like slogging through mud. The special effects shots were good, but by the time the big-deal climactic battle arrived, I had already given up on this waste of time. I can't believe that so many national critics gave it good reviews."
1,"First of all I did not like the book Witch of Blackbird Pond. It's not that the author didn't try, it's just that I hated the book. She may have won many awards for many books, but I don't thing this book desverd any recognition. The book may seem interesting to many others, but it seems like a reason to take a nap to me.It may be because I can't stand historical fiction, most of the time, or that I just didn't like the book. I've read her previous work , and they were very good, but this book just makes her work seem like a joke. I think the book should have a little more excitement before I give it any recogniton."
1,"As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."
1,"I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
2,"I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . This is the exact same one that comes with the camera , and the shipping was fast too."
1,The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible.
1,"I'm so mad! I got this supposedly ""new"" Cookbook and when it came it looked identicall to the first cookbook expcept her picture on the front is different! I bought the same book from Sandra Lee 2 years ago!! Same damn pictures and same damn recipes are in this ""new"" Cookbook! Don't waste your money I'm returning mine today!"
2,George and Lennie are two guys who are travailing and looking to earn enough money to buy some land.They get to work on a ranch and meet an old man named Candy and a young man named Slim. Then the bosses son Curly starts some truble becouse he is smaller than Lenny so he is mad. It is all taking place in a dry and dusty and hot time. So it will make you sweat to read this book. it is a good book for the more mature audiences due to the language.But it is a great book! check it out at your local library today.
2,"THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE."
2,This album rocks! This together w/Violator was DM at their prime!It's now 16 years later and get over it you say?Never!
1,"I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it."
2,"FW is not a piece of literature. It is beyond literature: It approaches life and non-life. Is life easily analyzed and coherent? Is non-life? Joyce recognized the dichotomy and tried to capture the incapturable in words. He taunts the reader with meaning and the critic with nonsense. Ultimately, both the divergencies converge and vice versa. Take a look at the Mandelbrot fractal: Numbers approach nil and infinity giving alluring patterns in a mimicry of life and non-life. Joyce creates the already-created, concurrently destroying the already-destroyed.A long the...Joyce presents the question - forbidden fruitriverrun,Joyce slithers toward us - temptationpast Eve and Adam'sJoyce plunges the reader into chaos - banishmentWe find ourselves ensnared in a recirculation, striving once again for order, until we realize that we must step back in order to find Truth.I haven't even read the book, but does it really matter???"
2,"This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 ""I Need A Hot Girl"", ""We On Fire"", ""Respect My Mind"" & ""Tuesday & Thursday"". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? ""Ridin'"" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like ""Clear Tha Set"" by Lil'Wayne. ""Ya Dig"" by Juvenile. ""Help"" by B.G., and ""Bout Whatever"" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. ""Too Hot"" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!"
1,"As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!"
2,"Perfect size for my morning latte or cappuccino. I fill it 2/3 full to leave room for a little foam before I transfer the liquid to my 16 oz. travel mug. It pours cleanly from the spout. Stainless steel pitcher can get quite hot to the touch from steaming, obviously, but the handle never does."
1,"After 6 months of very light use, this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip, taking 100 or so important shots with it. Cannot afford to use this kind of quality again."
2,"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Childhood's End"", along with modern-day cyberpunk like ""Neuromancer"", ""Count Zero"", ""Prey"", ""Cryptonomicon"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter"", etc."
2,20Q is the best game EVER INVENTED! All my family members are amazed on how it gets it right 9/10 times!! EVERYONE WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! :)
2,"This is one of the best Christian music CDs you can ever find in the music industry. Christian music is different from secular music, and the difference is that Christian musicians are there to praise God, instead of praising themselves for their talent, and to guide listeners' heart and mind to God through music. And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life. It is more than just beautiful. Too bad, there is only 5 stars to rate her. I would give her 10 stars!"
2,"This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!"
1,"I purchased this Sony VCR at a Target, thinking you can rely on Sony, well I was wrong. It did not record a very good quality picture from my TV (cable). I tried switching tapes, and recorded in both EP and SP, but there was always some kind of disturbance seemingly from one particular point in the reel/head/whatever. It occurred regularly in playback, about every few seconds at the beginning of the tape, and then occurring in shorter intervals toward the end of the tape. Oh, and I used new Sony tapes, which did fine on my older Sony VCR...go figure, but don't buy it."
1,"I don't think the product does what they say it will do which makes it a very expensive bottle of oil. The program would not let me submit wtih no stars, which is what I would give the product based on the claims for the products usage."
2,"Really good value for the money compared to anything else I've looked at. It's a well-built basic stereo amplifier. The only controls it has are volume and balance. You can connect two sets of speakers, which is useful for me -- I use it in the bedroom and bathroom, so I can choose whether I want to have sound in either room or both. I highly recommend it if you want a decent amplifier on a budget."
2,"My husband and I love auto racing of all kinds. My husband loved this movie. I'm writing this review for him, as I'm not much of an Elvis Presley fan."
2,"Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old."
2,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Sidney Poitier is charming anddelightful as Homer Smith. Homer experiences car trouble on a desert road. He receives assistance from a group of nuns in a nearby retreat.He obliges by doing chores for the nuns. The superior nun persuades himto build them a chapel. Homer is at first reluctant, but soon the projectbecomes as important to him as it is to the nuns. Poitier received a well-deserved Oscar for his role. Lilia Skala was nominated for BestSupporting Actress as the leader of the nuns. A spiritually feel-goodfilm. Excellent. (4 stars out of 5)"
1,"I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!"
1,"Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
1,"If you want a cd player better spend a few extra bucks on a major namebrand product. I received this cd player yesterday and I'm returning it today. How bad could it be? Man, this is really a cheap and inferior product. The cd would skip frequently the track it was playing; there is a lot of static in the sound;it has low volume; and it has the cheapest construction in the world. You gotta be extremely careful when inserting a cd. The arm where the cd holder sits (i believe the lens runs along this part) will considerably move downwards to the slightest force. I agree with Bruce from NY. I don't want this cd player even for free. After returning this product I purchased a Sony cd player. Sure it was more expensive, but is working fine. Believe me, you'll regret purchasing this Memorex MD3020 cd player."
2,"I got this book by accident, I was in a group of books that a coworker left for to look through. And after reading it I was just captivated by it all and wanted to read more of julie garwoods book. The story was just wonderful and all that I love to see in stories.I loved how ms garwood told the story about guillans father and his death and how her and her sister were talken away. It was wonderful and helped later in the book to already understand things and not have to wait to find out why this or that was going to happen.My favorite part of this book was when guillan finds out that she was married on a horse. "" A horse, I was married on a horse""? It was just perfect..I look forward to reading all of Ms. garwoods book and hope that she will be writing for a long time to come."
1,"Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
2,"I'm now a grandfather. But I've been watching kung fu movies ever since 1961, as a kid growing up in San Francisco Chinatown. This movie rates as one of my all time favorite kung fu movies, and I own about 100 or so.The print isn't very good. The subtitles are hard to read. The story is among the most complicated and convoluted, especially for the non Cantonese speaking. But who watches a kung fu movie for plots?What I really enjoyed about the movie is that it actually shows what the Chinese cinema could actually do. It has tremendous battle scenes. Despite the poor print quality, the movie has some fantastic visuals.The movie is not a documentary. The movie is not an ""imagined documentary."" A lot of things seem to come out of left field. But it's OK. It's a MOVIE!!Quite frankly, the movie plot could easily be translated into a Star Wars episode!"
2,"Most of this is on the collections ""My Best"" and ""Essential,"" but one killer cut is not: Got to Move. If you like Sonny Boy solos that start slow and then slay you with one intense phrase, ""Got to Move"" delivers."
1,"This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it. No scares, no suspense, nuthin. Rock bottom."
1,"Keanu Reeves just walking through dialogue while trying to recall ""Devils Advocate"" is a polite way to critique this apocoliptic mess. I was bored to tears watching this. The makers must have been counting on the sound engineer to liven this thing up. Alot of swoops and loud annoying noises while everyones voice seems to be at a whisper or above(except for a few ridiculous shouts). Wow the angel Gabriel really made sense, and yes I'm being funny. Possibly some decent computer generated things, but its been done better before, or at least in a better film. A bunch of mish mosh with an even worst ending."
2,"1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable."
2,This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^
1,"That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a ""Loser"", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours."
1,Totally unbelievable and bad in all respects. Really worthless. Only reason I give it two stars is because the [Vietnamese girl]is not bad to look at when they first abduct her.
2,"Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded."
2,"Rebecca Smith's work on Electronic Resume's and Online Networking is a must read. It's one of those books that you hate to loan out, for fear of it not being returned! The definite, premiere work on strategic methods for succeeding in a competitive job market!"
2,This is HARD to find. There is a newer version very similar to this and is NOT as good. It has too many biblical references for my taste and the general illustrations are not as good. This is the one to have. Great shower gift.
2,"I am an avid dog lover. I found this book to be both exciting, and well written. Great job!"
1,"The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products."
2,"It arrived in a timely manner.I haven't gotten to read it yet, but I'm super excited about it.I've been reading through Isaiah and I wanted something to go along with it."
1,Mtv has always sucked and the same goes for Kelly. Its funny that when her first album didn't sell she wanted to quit. And Changes only became a hit single because it had Ozzman on it. And it only sold because fans had pity because of his ATV thing.P.S. Now that Kelly is drug head maybe her songs will get better. Seeing as she might understand what some of her dads songs are about.
2,I frequently attend scrapbook retreats and crops and am very hot natured - so I ordered this fan for those occassions and it is great and the light on the top of it is an added bonus
2,"Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, and Fats Waller. That line up alone is a historic line-up. This was a major accomplishment to bring this cast together in 1943. A treat for the whole family."
2,"This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. I watched this before my son was born, and had a completely natural birth because of it. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital. The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here!"
1,"Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.""In the future, Firemen burn books"" -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."
2,"Marvelous read, loved by the entire book club, all ages couldn't put it down. You really felt the pain of the times."
2,A good book for Self-Defense folks. I was hoping for something new but it pretty much reiterated what we already know (preaching to the choir). Not a bad evening read.
1,"This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow."
2,"Nuel Emmons is the author, so these are his words. He only translates into readable print what Charles Manson is trying to relate to us. I have no sympathy for Manson, being where he is, as he is a grown man and is responsible for his own actions. He cannot blame his childhood for the mistakes he made as an adult.However, I do feel sorry for Charles Manson, the child. Growing up, he was totally confused, and I do have sympathy for him at that stage of his life. However, anyone with even a SHRED of common sense, knows you cannot think like the adult Manson and get away with it for long."
2,"GREAT live!! And catchy tunes, too!Get this record for great ""Americana"", roots, acoustic, thoughtful, whatever you wanna call it rock & roll.And catch them live if you have the opportunity!Check out their website @ http://www.sortaweb.com/"
1,"I think this is my first review in the years I've been on Amazon, but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product.I bought both the DGK and theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")and I have to say that the WhiBal just feels better and feels that it will last a lot longer(the DGK cards are only about the third of the thickness of a WhiBal). However the Digital Grey Kard has one thing going for it, it has a superior laynard.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and get theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")instead."
1,"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas ""alone"" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his ""consultation"", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."
2,now that i have lot of grands i keep them occupied with good movies like this one.. I still monitor what they watch so this is how i do it.. i buy the movies and place them on the shelf to keep them off of the idiot box....
1,"I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it."
1,"Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
1,"This book contained some useful information on the basic grammer of the english language, but was mediocore (at best) compared to the Yarber's previous book (reviewing basic grammer, also available on amazon.com)"
1,"This product is abridged and not what I wanted. If Amazon wishes to sell an abridged version of a product the word ""ABRIDGED"" should be at the top of the page in big flashing letters, not buried somewhere."
1,I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey.
1,"The item was not fully described. I thought it would fit my Rebel camera,however it did not.Nor"
1,"People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this."
2,works like a charm. i had misplaced my original charger and this is a MUST to use the camera.great price and shipped in plenty of time.
2,I recall this recording on LP in the early fifties. It conveys the humour and genius of Mozart with great singers although other than Steber they were not previously identified with WM.
2,"I really Like This CD because I like this kind of ""Teen Music"". It seems Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera with a bad day and Enrique Iglesias... Its Just a GOOD CD.ME PIERDO JUNTO A TI: A VERY GOOD song, I love it. (9/10)VAS A VOLVERME LOCA: Good, but not the best from the CD. (7/10)LA LECCIN: One of the best songs. (10/10)LA NOCHE LLEG: Very ""Enrique Iglesias Style"". (8/10)NO SOY UN NGEL: Not very bad...but too Machine (6/10)NADIE COMO T: VERY GOOD. Too Romantic (10/10)UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD: GOOD!! (7/10)TU ME SALVASTE AYER: So...Funny!!! (9/10)DONDE ESTS EL CIELO ESTAR: It's not very bad...(6/10)ESCCHAME: VERY VERY GOOD! (10/10)ENGLISH TRACKS: Not very bad at all...but in English. (6/10)"
2,I was assigned to read the introduction for class but was so captivated that I had to buy the book in its entirety. Moten is a scholar and a poet. This book will be a staple in my research repertoire.
1,These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized. DO NOT buy if you need steel toe.
2,"Greek Gods and Heroes is one of the better books on mythology for children out thare, with great pictures and easy to understand stories that people of all ages can enjoy. As a child it was my favorite book in the school library and I checked it out over and over again. It is a must have for any fan of the greek gods and the myths about them."
1,"We own every European travel book that exists. I can honestly say that this one is by far the worst one I have seen, hands down. The coverage of accommodations is sparse and only includes extraordinarily expensive hotels, for the most part, and the dining recommendations are little better. There are no unique tips in this guide and it really covers 6 cities, and not very comprehensively. I give an extra star for making the attempt to write a kids travel guide, since they are not common."
1,"Previously we had used Earth's Best since size 1, 2.5 years ago. I recently decided to save money on his size 5s and go non-ecological with the mainstream ""best"" which are apparently Pampers. Not only do they smell like pungent baby powder out of the package, they just don't work. Our son isn't overly wet, due to regular diaper changes, but these diapers couldn't even contain pee for a 2 hour span. In addition, when he wakes up his pajamas smell like he had an accident, due to the thinness of the Pampers. And yes, more often than not he was wet through to the pajamas, sheets, etc., and if he pooped overnight, he was rewarded with a sopping wet diaper, a wedgie, and poop leaking out. We have four kids, and trust me, use Earth's Best. Does anybody want 152 Pampers?Hope one of these links works, and of course, look for subscribe and save!!Amazon search--Earth's Best TenderCare Chlorine Free Diapers, Size 5 (27+ Pounds), 104 CountDirect cut and paste-- [...]"
1,Have used this product before and was quite pleased with it so when I saw it on sale at Amazon I bought two bottles. Not sure if what I got was the real stuff or if it was grossly past the expiration date but it did not compare to what I had bought at the Molton Brown store before.I ended up throwing the stuff away and bought a new bottle directly from MB. I will never again buy this product on Amazon. I will buy from a MB store to make sure I get a quality product.
1,"The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!"
2,"Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
2,Does exactly as advertised. Easy installation. Good price compared to the same item at other stores.
2,"I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I had heard people talk of it forever and always put it in my mind as a book to read, but I didn't think that it would necessarily be an enjoyable read. I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book. (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)So about the book... It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read. The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story. This book is pretty short. I think it is a must read for anyone. I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!"
1,"Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. Perhaps its me, I am retard! but I felt I was robbed of time. I found it lacked story, and the moral of the story was odd. ok, in the end, the main character dreamed it all--did she? The Journey to the Centre of the Earth had much more imagination and charm by the rope length!"
2,"I love this movie and have watched it numerous times. I am a big Cher and Nicholas Cage fan though, so I may be biased. It's just a nice love story and I love the Italian flavor it has. It is really true to life ITALIAN. Nicholas Cage is awesome in this movie."
2,piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. she is an empowering actress and deserves an academy award nomination. the whole cast is great though. this movie is excellent.
1,"After spending many years watching the witty repartee and sight gags of the Trinity series I had hopes that ""Boot Hill"" would continue in this vein. What I got was a very hard to follow and sadly, very boring, spaghetti Western. Few, if any, redeeming moments. I wish Terrence Hill, upon reading the script to this turkey, would have done some Trinity slaps on the director and/or screenwriter."
2,"After hearing ""Free"", Ultra Nate made me a fan of her music! The cd has 6 different mixes from a wide range of dj's. And nobody knows hot to mix a song better than them. Junior Sanchez will make you fan of his work for sure. The cd was also nicely completed with 4 other tracks that aren't ""free"" remixes. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is an ""Ulta Nate"" fan."
2,"4 STARS BECAUSE it sounded fine but not as great as other string quartets.I like this because the string quartet 2 uses 2 cellos.,1 violin,1 viola which was interesting.You can hear the cello more than in the other string quartets with 2 violins.This also another rare CD at a simple price."
1,"very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
1,"Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
2,"The book ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. And oh, how this is needed in these times of crisis and confusion in church catechesis. A must read for every Catholic of all ages, religious and clergy included, and a great book to share."
1,"You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand ""Do It Best"" crap FROM CHINA. Junk don't buy."
2,"This CD will touch everybody from thugs to lovers. Songs like I Wish and the remix will bring back memories if you have ever lost somebody that you love. The rest of the CD kicks [behind] for romantics, but those two make it worth gettin"
1,"I'd make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. ""If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish..."". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song."
1,"It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses. The nutdriver is too big for the nut.(The same was true for the other key chain product I bought) I currently use a tweezers to tighten them, which does scratch the glass by the base of the nut. I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers."
2,"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."
2,"It's easy - it communicates well with most wireless networks - easy, no-fuss TiVo networking."
2,"Excellent A masterpieceSupersonic, Cigarrettes & Alcohol , Rock and Roll Star, Shakermaker, Slide away and obviously Live Forever are still going to be listened 30 years from now""I need to be myself I can`t be no one else """"You and I are going to live forever""Best band of the 90'sLa mejor banda de los 90's le pese a quien le pese"
2,We always use this to support shoes that we love. Glad to still find it somewhere. The price is also right
1,"This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user."
1,"These diapers are awful and we'll never get them again. They seemed thinner than the Huggies we normally buy, so I guess the only plus is that you can fit more in the diaper bag/in the basket on the changing table, but the positives end there. They leak like crazy - esp. when they get pretty full during naps/bedtime - we have to wake up our son to change him in the middle of the night so he doesn't wake up in wet pajamas and a puddle in the morning. Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any. He also easily took them off, unlike the Huggies - probably because they were sagging and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we have 222 to get through... ugh..."
2,"This album documents Queen's last album as a confident band. After this, everything changes, and they start doing stuff to please others rather than themselves. They would never, for instance, produce a pop classic like ""Calling All Girls."" The muddied production that scars the rest of their albums, as well as quoting their own songs, is not present on Hot Space. Sure, there's wimpy electronic drums, but there is on Prince albums, too. It's the songs that are strong, and they're not afraid to do funky stuff, following thier bliss. I abhore the revisionist Brian May, going on about how he hated doing the funky stuff. Listen to his solo on ""Back Chat."" I really think this album is a document of a band at a crossroads. Fans who have listed to Greatest Hits and likes it should by this album well before Innuendo, The Miracle, and Made in Heaven."
2,I have been collecting cookbooks for 20 years and this is the one I can't live without. Incredibly easy recipes with delicious results. You won't even realize you're on a diet!
1,"There were somo pieces broken and for sure people who buy this windshield mount is going to put in the windshield of their car, so I can't plug a radio freq. thing to it because this mount it's blocking the jack input. Not a good product at all."
2,"""Spinout"" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In ""Spinout"" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on ""The Donna Reed Show"". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single."
1,"My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc."
1,really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers.
2,"Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction.Our hero is framed for the abduction of princess Thuvia, so he goes to rescue her and clear his name.It's also a pretty classic romance plot, with the hero and heroine in love with each other, but unsure how the other feels, and societal/political conventions standing in their way. *shhhh... don't tell."
1,"We were very disappointed in this wallet for the amount of money we paid. It is very cheaply made, and the person we got it for didn't like it. We would have been better off going to a discount store and getting a $5.00 wallet."
2,"This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!"
1,"I remember Armored Saint from their tour opening for WASP and Metallica. L'Amour in Brooklyn. These guys ROCKED. Unfortunately this album, lacking second guitarist Phil Sandoval, does not rock. Poor production values, even explained on the liner, makes it even less acceptable. I gave it the second star only because it was great to hear ""Can U Deliver?"" again and I can't find the now out of print ""March of the Saint"" first album. Buy it if you're a die-hard Saint fan like myself, but if you're looking for a good Saint album currently available get ""Symbol Of Salvation"" instead. It's pretty rockin'."
2,Ok I really like this movie I mean the story line was awesome. I watched it so many times at a friends house then borrowed it to take home. My mom watched it and hated it. She did not like the way the girls danced.... i dunno I thought it was great....
1,"This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. The elevator won't work, and I had to forcefully put some of the pieces together. Most people who reviewed this toy, had the same complaints, but I bought it anyway, because my nephew really wanted it. I'm glad that I only paid $15.00 for it, because it's not worth any more than that. Some pieces came off, before my nephew even got a chance to play with it."
2,"though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture.."
1,"Wow, this is one of the most useless ""books"" I have ever read. Based on the title, one would expect some sort of insight into a career search. I found this book to be no help at all. It looks like the author lifted a few job ideas from the government job handbook and wrote a bad Clif's Notes for them. If you want guidance, please do not waste your time and money on this drivel. I agree with the previous reviewer.... I feel sorry for anyone that actually paid for this book."
1,I purchased a box of Pampers baby dry size 1( 252 pcs) and found brown stained at the front of the diapers. Still have 2 unopened bags with brown stained.
1,"i bought the sts13-s venturer and it will not play my cds, nor dvds the cd loads put does not play, it freezes the disc doesn't spin at all, i cannot get anything on my tv at all, is there anyone that can help me out here, could it be the head on it, i hope not it is fresh out of the box. please if someone can help iwould really appreciate it.thankspat"
2,"When I first saw this book in my photo class, I thought the images were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn't read the text with all the pictures. When I bought it for myself, and got to read everything, it gave me even more of a respect for this work. Her snips of these girls lives rattle and amaze you at the same time. I love this book so much, and I think every girl/woman should look at it."
2,I am using this amplifier to power speakers in a training room. It gives good sound and is plenty loud enough for my needs.
2,"We're a MAC family, so my apprehension to any ""works with PC or Mac"" device is based on past bad experiences. This baby works!TiVo's Wireless G USB Network Adapter worked so fast that I was sure that I made a mistake. With the Airport in the next room and this tiny toy hooked up to the TiVo a room away, we're sending photos through Yahoo! and ENJOYING TV like never before. We watch less, but watch much, much better. I now program shows to record at work or anywhere at an hour's notice.Mindblowingly cool and a true ""show-off"" item that works 100% perfectly!"
2,"I didn't get to play with this much as it was a gift for my nephew, but from what I saw it was a well made toy. The magnet worked well and even the older kids wanted to play with it."
2,"I read Betty Smith's book shortly after it was first published. As a young girl, I loved it. Oh these many years later it was a nostalgic read, and I enjoyed revisiting the world."
1,"These are great lectures by Spurgeon, but the format of the book is very poor. It is a photo reproduction of one of the original editions and the type is VERY small and hard to read. There are other editions, Eerdmans for example, that are much better for a similar price."
2,"It's about time that stoner rock acknowledged it's british blues/blues-rock/psychedelic/acid rock/hard rock roots. Good riffs, nice bluesey vocals, that's all I gotta say."
1,"This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's ""weird"" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.""Mothman"" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."
2,"Jerry Goldsmith created soundscapes that sometimes surpassed the films they were written for in evoking emotions and revealing character. For Logan's Run, Goldsmith came up with one of his most brilliant creations. It opens with stark, electronic sounds, effectively mirroring the cold future society depicted in the film. Only when Logan breaks out of the domed city and into the natural world does Goldsmith allow the full orchestra to come in, warming up the music just as Logan's worldview expands. This release finally captures the full range and power of the score in pristine sound. And, heck, I even like the Love Theme tacked on at the end..."
1,"The weights in my old weight vest have started to desintegrate so it was time for a new one. The price is right and other reviews were very positive. On reviewer who said she was 5'2"" found it too short. I did not think this would be a problem for me because I am considerably taller, 5'7"". However it is too long...sits on the hips rather than hanging from the shoulders and ending at the waist line like my old one does. I do not think it will be very comfortable so I am sending it back. Also, I thought the illustration I looked at showed it as black. It is white, not attractive (How attractive can a weight vest be?) and will probably look dirty very soon and have to be laundered a lot."
1,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2. Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well. Pay the two dollars and get the complete book. Who knows how much else is missing."
1,"Promised with this item are ""Complete Instructions"" and the additional pledge that ""Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!"" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/"
2,"These Milwaukee router bits are presently being clearanced out by multiple sellers, and they appear to be identical to Freud's premium router bits (but without the red paint). As such they can be an excellent bargain. You get a very nice Italian made bit for Chinese bit prices.Be warned, however, that this bit would more accurately be called a 1/4"" shank bit with a 1/2"" by 1"" cutter. The 2-5/8"" description is misleading at that refers to the entire bit length including the shank. For my purposes (at at the closeout bargain price), the 1"" cutter length is fine ... but be sure you know what you are getting."
2,"In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting."
1,"A plot and story that has been done before, better. Miserably bad acting: Tara Banks, Leanne Rymes. Only highlight: John Goodman. Better yet, rent something else."
2,"Quality is always first with Swanson, they are perfectly square when you test them. Lightweight enough to be easy to handle, but strong enough to not bend like the cheap ones. Best price and instant ship."
2,"From the first time I heard Liam belt out ""Live Forever"", I was hooked. This CD really ushered in britpop as we all know it, and defined the middle part of the last decade. Some five years on, it's a CD that is standing up beautifully. Definitely Maybe is full of raw energy and punk attitude all the way through. Classic tracks like Live Forever, Slide Away, and Supersonic, are instantly catchy and powerful. I also really love the gem, ""Married With Children"", (about the only soft song on the disc). Like them or not, the Oasis boys really made one hell of a rock record. The disc is full of past styles and refences, not just the Beatles, but a bit of the Stones, T-Rex, and The Sex Pistols for good measure. This cd is Definitely one of the decade's best. No if's, and's, or maybe's."
1,"The title would lead one to believe that this book would help explain the foundation and workings of the Mormon faith. This is not the case. The limited text supplies the reader with just a basic explanation of what is being depicted in the photo. This is a good book for someone just interested in getting a superficial intro to this belief system, but nothing more."
1,just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad.
2,"Many thanks to Collector's Choice for reissuing this magnificent album on CD, previously only available on disc in the fine but expensive and rare Japanese pressing.""Smoke From A Distant Fire"" is one of a few dozen tunes that instantly, for those of us in our late 30s/early 40s, takes you back to the great days of AM gold. And, the good part, it's not the only catchy, likeable tune on the record.In a time when almost anything seems to qualify as ""a classic"", this duo and these tunes really are."
2,"Corey Rudl has put together a solid set of information here, with examples and specific strategies that work. I paid the $200 for the course and kept it, using one of the strategies paid for the course cost in a matter of days.I do agree that the book heavily promotes the company's software, but the process by which the author does this, to generate backend revenue, is in itself an excellent example of internet sales and cross selling in action. The promotion is a bit overdone re: the authors mailloop and other software programs, but, there are other programs out there as well.I got excited about the ideas, and ramped up several new strategies, eg emails and affiliate programs, immediately on reading the book and am doing well with it.Hey if you don't like it he has a lifetime guarantee on the book, that's pretty confident. I've returned many junky books, this course is not among them, a 'keeper'."
2,"These guys definitely have it. No joke. I've heard a lot of modern ""blues"" bands that are really really bad. Usually bands like this genuinely love blues music and want to play some blues themselves. You see them on-stage and they're going thru the motions and you can admire them for being so passionate about really bad songs, but you leave completely unsatisfied. This album is everything I could wish for from a modern blues bands. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
1,Just a reminder to Clay. if you want to succeed in the business as a respected singer and performer i suggest that you work w/ only the best composers and musical arrangers in the business.I have someone like David Foster in mind. Dianne Warren and even Jim Brickman.I don't want to see your talent go to waste.Think about it boy. you deserve the best and work w/ the best in the business.
2,"This movie is not for everyone, but I love the absurd humor. Every character in it is irrational in some way. Where films today would probably mock the characters in a mean way, this film has more of a sad and sweet acceptance of their eccentricities. It respects the courage of human beings who have obviously been damaged by the hardships of life but still continue to muddle through. Just like real life."
2,"This is the greatest album since ""Dizzy Up A Girl"" by Goo Goo Dolls. Clay is so natural at singing, it's like he sings like we breathe! Also, people who leave bad reviews, weren't really Clay fans to begining with, because anything Clay sings is wonderful!"
1,"The below reviews make me wonder if they heard the same song I did. Five years since their international smash ""The Fat of the Land,"" electronic punkers Prodigy return with ""Baby's Got a Temper,"" a curiously muted comeback of a single. Though not awful, the beats and groove sound very 1997; a mid-tempo dance rocker with no surprises. I can't pinpoint what else is wrong with this single, but it looks like it could use a serious remix or maybe more production. The good news is that the band announced that their next album won't be around until early 2003, giving Prodigy ample time to beef up their sound and come up with better material than this."
1,I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue
1,I bought this for a birthday gift for my 8 year old nephew. He hated it. It does not contain the Three Stooges TV episodes we all watched as kids. Brother-in-law said it is a bunch of vaudeville stuff.
1,"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."
2,I had looked all over Houston for these and could not find them. They are just what I wanted.
1,"I bought the Kindle edition of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard under the impression that it was the translation done by English playwright Tom Stoppard as the authorship of the item clearly states in Amazon's description. However, upon examining the title page of the Kindle book I was shocked to see someone else listed as the translator. I have not read this translation and therefore cannot review it, but I am extremely disappointed that Amazon is misrepresenting this item and they need to dix it!"
2,"I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."
1,"Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."
2,"Near the end of world war 2, the scientist in Los Alamos,New Mexico, were working on a project called the atomic bomb. Stephen Orr is a thirteen year old boy living on a top secret military base with his father. Stephens father is one of the physicist building the bomb. Stephen tries to tell his father that building the bomb will kill inocent people.His dad doesnt listen. Stephens father still helps build the atomic bomb. Stephens father gets sick and later dies. Stephen and his friend stop the making of the atomic bomb and save the world from being destroyed."
1,We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
2,I have read this book a few times since it came out. It had to be replaced because it was faling apart and I could not find anyone to repair it. Looking forward to getting the last book in the series in hardback.
2,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quick with no hassles. Beats gas, time and crowds that are experienced when going to a brick and mortar store."
2,Mr. Aiken can sing. Something that seems to be rare with so called pop stars these days. I love that I can listen to this CD and understand the words to every song clearly. The power in his voice is unsurpassed by anyone in recent years. Every song on this CD is great. It would be impossible to pick a favorite. I can't wait for his next release.
2,"After reading SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, I would definetely recommend it to young adults and adults alike!"
2,"I loved this movie. It is an instant classic with up to date special effects. I also noticed book elements from ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas in it. Overall, a classic, buy yours today."
2,"I recently watched this at a friend's house. He has an excellent surround sound setup and this DVD has DTS. amazing.as a habit I don't like live concert video - rarely buy them.the guest artists are phenomenal - Paul McCartney at the end is lots of fun/great songs.How many times are you going to see Clapton and Knopfler playing together, filmed well and in DTS?you just can't go wrong with this DVD."
1,"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's."
1,"I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."
2,I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book. Both were excellent in my opinion.I had never read any of the great classics and this book started me on that. I havesince read the War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth
1,"I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well."
2,"Keeps coffee warm, not boiling. Does not re-warm. It simply keeps the beverage at the temperature it was when you put it on the plate."
2,You definitely get a a ton of diapers with this purchase and the price is pretty good when other retailers aren't having diaper sales. The diapers keeps my baby dry especially over night.
2,"I purchased this CD for a college assignment on the war generation. I picked a perfect book. Tom Brokaw truly captures an entire generation with detailed accounts of their heroic challenges they faced. I believe that the only downfall to this book is Tom Brokaw's voice. As nice as it sound on TV doing the news, it seems to be a bit monotone. It started to drive me nuts several times while listening. I guess that's why I chose to purchase the book on CD so I could just stop it at any time and then pick it back up an hour or two later. Overall, it is well worth the money."
2,"This book was one of the best I've read so far. While ""Bad Girl Creek"" wasnt one of my favorites, this little gem sure was. I couldn't put it down, I was so intrigued by it...especially Phoebe and Sally. Can't wait to read ""Goodbye Earl."""
2,I read a lot of young adult historical fiction as a kid and this was one I read over and over. I think I just liked the characters.
2,"Pregnancy can be a very long wait. This book helps a lot by giving you a month by month accounting of what is happening in the development of the baby, both in words and with awesome photos.Highly recommend for any new mom-to-be."
2,"This is the best video he has done since ""Here's your sign."" I would recommend this video to everyone I know."
1,"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
1,This is one of the best movies of all time. The only reason I dont have this movie on DVD is because it is only available in full screen. The movie is a 5 star movie but the DVD only receives 2 stars because of the lack of options for widescreen viewing. I am waiting patiently for them to change it to widescreen and until then unfortunately I suggest the same. You miss so much including the director's vision when you watch it in full screen that it is not worth it until you can see this fabulous movie as the way it was originally made.
1,"The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad."
2,"If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called ""Madame Castel's Lodger,"" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"
1,"Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
2,"We just finished with a trip to visit family and it worked great. Around 500 miles each way.It took about an hour to get it adjusted so I could get all 4 bikes on at once. After that, everything was set and I loaded 4 bikes in 10-15 minutes. I'm sure I'll get even better.The only improvement they could make would be to have two posts with more space. The middle 2 bikes fit really tight so you have to put them in just right. It was harder because my son has a BMX style bike and our daughter has a similar bike with 16"" (I believe) wheels. Those fall through the mounts, but it stays in there securely anyway.My arms don't lock in the down position very easily, but I only use that for storage so I'm not worried. I'd probably buy it again, especially for the price."
2,"I was introduced to Edgar Rice Burroughs when a teenaged girl. What fun to meet again after so many years! The brave & handsome hero. The exotically beautiful unpredictable heroine. The fantastic, never before imagined creatures of Mars. Swashbuckling adventures with a bit of future science to add delicious flavor to the dish. Grand reading!"
1,"My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space."
1,"I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
2,"I love all the songs on the album and its a great first album. I feel the song ""touch"" is probably my favorite and then the next would be ""The Way"" and both would do very well on the charts if released as a single. Clay definitely does sound different than A I and in some aspects I miss that amazing vocal range he has which is clearly not expressed as much on his debut CD. All and all the CD is very good but I hope for this next album there are songs that have more of a range in them."
1,"Surely the developer of the game had to notice that the tower would not stay on. I also notices that the bushes (or whatever they are)do not attach where they are located as shown on the box and they will not stay attached either. If I glue everything on, it will probably be o.k., but why wouldn't the manufacturer have just made the connection for the tower more durable? Toy is actually fun and hold my childs attention, if you can keep it together."
2,"I started reading Jean Auel's Earth Children series many years ago. I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive."
1,"I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
2,This first book in my 62 years that has make me laugh & cry. It is an amazing story of a young women who suffering made her stronger to survive & to love unconditionally.
1,"I love the size and comfort of these. I ordered a pair and within 1 week they started leaking at the seams. I then did an exchange online and AMAZON was great about taking care of it. However, the second pair did exactly the same thing. I would not buy these or recommend to anyone!"
1,"This book is set up as a dictionary. If you enjoy reading dictionaries, then please purchase this book. The humor was lost on me because of the format."
2,This is our 2nd electric kettle. We had a Breville & it stopped workingafter about 2 years of use. The Cuisinart came looking brand new. So farit has been working just fine & for the price I figured it was worth a shot.We have been happy with it and it gets used at least 2 times a day.
1,The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
1,"I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"
2,This movie was so entertaining. I was in stitches from laughing so much - it was so funny and enjoyable. Diane Lane was incredible in this film. She is such a good actress and here she proves that she is funny as well. This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year. Brilliant stuff!
2,I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people. My only gripe is that they don't fit every single diffrent headset out there. They worked great for mine but I need a new one and I noticed that only about half of the bluetooth headsets out there will fit these.
2,I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
1,"Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
2,I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish.
2,"I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again."
2,"Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."
1,"Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information"
2,This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.
2,Loved the caraters but was hopping to see Ramsey in his own book. It seemed rushed at the end to include both Brodrick and Ramsey. It is a wonderful book but nothing compared to The Secret.
2,"When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!"
2,I bought this specifically for making brown rice as I could never get a good texture on a conventional stove -- it's makes wonderful brown rice.
1,"I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
2,Shipped promptly! Just what dauther needed and in time for her to read for her English class! I would recommend!
1,If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it's condescension. I can't stand being talked down to.There are much better videos out there that treat the viewer as if they are an adult.
2,Bjork shows that she's got the beat. Articulate words from an original voice make this the first of one of the best hi energy CD's I've ever heard. You don't want to mix the remixes either.
2,very nice car bed my son is 3 years old and he really likes his new car bed and it was pretty easy to put together i highly recommend this car bed to all the people out there looking for a car bed
1,"Too little of the the major events that I was interested in, and too much of the little events"
1,"I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book."
2,"These puzzles are absolutely hilarious! Yet again, I'm blown away by the exquisite surprises, twists and turns. I've been stumped on a few of them for a few days now, but I'm not giving up! Shortz is, hands down, a genius. Try your hand at the masterful art within these pages, and enjoy the furrowed brow and laughs!"
2,"I am not a professional educator or homeschooler, but as a Dad I need to be sure my kids are learning the things they need to learn. This is a very helpful resource to me because it gives an overview of what kids should be learning at each stage along the way. (Fortunately, my kids' school seems to be doing pretty well in most areas.) This resource helps me plan what areas to supplement with home reading and projects."
1,"This is the worst dating book ever for catholics. The author believes that dating should be mechanical and leaves little space for God's grace and healing.And you are to kiss once you get married not before. Perhaps it's an american custom as the author is american. Avoid at all costs, it was a waste of money. Better get 'The Question' rather than this book."
2,"This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals."
2,Loving this series. Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more
1,"This long-awaited follow up to the 4.5 Resource Kit has been a great disappointment. (Don't take my word for it - go look at the comments in the SBS2000 newsgroup)I'm not into denigrating other people's work, but this book really doesn't have any plus points.To be brief: - it fails to explain essential concepts, with each chapter having hardly any logical connection with those preceding it - the text is peppered with terms and acronyms which go undefined - there are few graphic examples or practical walkthroughs - what walkthroughs there are (e.g. for setup wizards) do little beyond provide hard copy screenshots of the SBS dialog boxes - the graphic layout is poor - oversized headlines made me suspect that, in the absence of decent text, the editor resorted to padding out the book.I felt as if whoever did edit the book had no knowledge of network computing, never mind SBS.Sorry, but this is a lemon."
2,"I ordered the same size 2 months ago. It was good. Now, this is my 2nd time order. Good product. As expected!"
1,"Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now..."
2,"It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. No viewing time not well-spent with the lavish production design, brilliant acting, and not-off-tangent-from-literature screenplay. I hope they release a DVD version right away."
2,"This is a wonderful book. The technique of using your Chi energy to help you run better, longer, and free from injury really works. I have just used it while I trained for my 1st marathon and I feel great! You have to give it a read"
2,"This is the only magazine I read regularly in college (25 years ago) that I still read now. Great articles on all kinds of issues and they do try to cater to black women from ages 20 to 55 or so which is not easy. Lately, it's been a little flat -- both in terms of magazine size and in the depth of the articles. I'm renewing it one more year and hope it improves during that time"
2,I ENJOYED THE MOVIE THOROUHLY.WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ESPECIALLY CHICANOS WHO CAN RELATE.MAKES ME WANT TO SEE THE MUSICAL.
2,"Delightful story. The plot accomodates itself to children of all ages. Plenty of action, humor, and silliness - the ingredients my children seem to thrive on. Stuart is about a kid trying to find his place in the world. And aren't we all?"
1,"I love these converses, the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38, however I got a massive size 40 (7) and they don't fit. Also I now live in London and can't return them. sad times :("
2,"This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!"
2,"When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!!!"
2,"It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. GET IT!!! Or if you are repelled@by the negative comments of others, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE FIRST!!!!@If you are going to read a book read Dangerous Angels: The Weetzie Bat books by Francesca Lia Block!"
1,"The Fluke current clamp works properly but the Amazon website listed the device as having 1000amp capacity. Actual specification is only 400 amps. Since I'm monitoring an 800 amp, AC service it's not too helpful. Please fix the website. Product description as of 05/06/12 says 1000amp AC/DC.In the technical details it would be very, very helpful if you would attach pdf's of the manuals and spec sheets."
2,This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody - the lyrics and vocals and everything about it is superb! It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are: Annie and Half A Week Before the Winter.
2,"Willie Russell did the screen play on this classic, northern England comedy. Russell is a liverpudlian with a marvelous sense of humor and a keen sense of class consciousness. Julie Walters should have gotten an academy award for this performance, because she showsthe subtle and profound changes in Rita that make this funny movie poignant."
2,"I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores"
2,I studied my butt off with the help of this book. The practice tests in this book were actually harder than the real ASVAB! That helped me be even more prepared. I only missed 5 questions on the ASVAB! NO LIE! Study this book for about 3 weeks and take it seriously. You will see your scores improve!!!
1,"Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."
1,"While I will readily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia's Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. The title character-a young, pregnant runaway searching for her baby's father-should have been one with whom you could sympathize. Instead, Trevor's love affair with language never quite manages to include his characters, leading to an unsatisfying reading experience. Couple the lack of emotion with a depressing ending, and you have a book best suited to gathering dust."
1,"At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money."
1,"I'm not sure what other people are looking for in a cookbook but for a busy mom like me this cookbook wasn't ideal, most of the recipes required 10+ ingredients many of which are not commonly found in the kitchen or grocery store. If you are the type of person who has unlimited amount of time to prep and cook your meals then this book would most likely be a great addition to your library but if you're like me and have only 20 minutes TOPS to get something in the oven or on the table then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
2,This is my fourth-grade son's favorite book. He loves cooking and this book is fun with great recipes.
1,"First off, I must say that I used to read these books when I was younger (even though I'm still a kid). And the stories in this book are the original great stories, but the ILLUSTRATIONS the best part of the original version, have been CHANGED. That really sucks because the new pictures are so watered down they aren't scary anymore. The new title should be Not Scary Stories to Tell in the dark."
2,"great condition and received it on time, very pleased with the service, would recommend amazon.com to every one and the price was compatible"
2,"A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."
1,"I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price. BUT the quality is not good enough. My daughter is a pretty good pooper and these diapers spil all the time! I have to change her clothes or wash sheets and mattress cover every day! The money I save on diapers i spend on detergent, energy and water.Huggies are so much better!"
2,"After watching and enjoying the movie John Carter, I saw that it was based on A Princess of Mars.The book and the movie have a lot of character similarities, but the story is quite different.I must say that I enjoyed each and would recommend the book to anyone who is a reader and enjoyed the movie."
2,"All of Mr Lepp's stories speak to me on a primal, fundamental level, in a place that brings me back to my life as a child.... shyeeha right! Honestly folks, Bil is one of the best guys i have ever met, and his stories have had me rolling with laughter more than once. He and his wife Paula and both salt of the earth, good people, and their belief in God, and the fundamental goodness of Mankind are reasons enough to own this book! Someday, you'll be glad you did!"
1,A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
2,Adapter very easy to install and worked immediately. Keeps TiVo up to date with no user intervention. Also allows connection from any PC with Free TiVo Desktop software.
1,"They're back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song ""Wanna Get Up"" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there's no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On ""Wanna Get Up"" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the ""SASH! Extended Edit"" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings."
2,"Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try."
2,"Almost all the songs on the soundtrack are great, but please be aware of the playlist difference of some of the reviews here, and what is actually on the cd. If you are looking for particular songs you may purchase the wrong cd if you go off the review."
1,"The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it."
2,"If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels."
1,"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated ""encyclopedia galactica"" entries was awkward and rough."
1,"I used Pampers sensitive diapers since my baby was born. As she grows and sleeps longer through the night, I was thinking maybe this Max Dry diaper will give her even better comfort. Yet, to my surprise, it didn't. Moreover, it leaked multiple times that I had to changed her from inside out. So I returned the rest of the package and continued using my previous Pampers Sensitive ones.By the way, I never receive any partial refund on this return package!"
2,I work at a Wild Birds Unlimited store and customers rely on you to give them the best information on bird feeding and care available. This book is super helpful in achieving that goal.
1,"I just got the ""New"" battery, but it looks like already got opened before.Also, It's not working. It can't charge the battery, the light is not turn on!!!!"
1,"The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase."
2,"I THINK THAT THIS ABLUM IS THE BOMB. I BOUGHT THIS ABLUM ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME AND FOUND MANY SOUNDS THAT I HEAR ON THE RADIO. BUT THE ONE THAT I NEVER HEARD WERE ALSO INSPIRING AND MOTIVATING AND VERY DELIGHTFUL TO HER. EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARD ME LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM ASK ME ""WHO IS THAT"" AND ""WHERE CAN I GET IT"" IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ABLUM AND LOVE GOSPEL *GET IT* OKAY!"
1,"Apparently Andrew Adamson thinks he can tell a better story than C.S. Lewis. Saying this movie is ""based"" on the book by the same title would be using the word ""based"" very loosely. While there are some commonalities between the two, probably 80 to 90% of the movie is comprised of material not in the book. If you are watching the movie without having ever read the books then it could be called a decent story. However, if you are expecting it to re-tell the story of Prince Caspian, then you will be greatly disappointed.Once again, Hollywood thought they could improve a story by re-making it, and once again they failed. A prime example . . . the added ""romance"" between two of the main characters. This was the worst addition of all!"
2,"It arrived in perfect condition and when they said so. Got this for my son, who wants to go into the Marines. He said, it has helped him with the Math since it breaks it down into layman terms and helped him understand the algebra section which he struggles with. So happy they have a book that focused on the test for military. This should give him a leg up on a good score on the test. God bless all our young men and women who give their all for our freedom."
1,"I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon."
1,"This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this."
1,"The Dissapointed. Why do I need demos of all the songs already on Apple Venus 1. Let's bring on Apple Venus 2, after all, isn't that what we were promised?"
2,"I prefer pampers in general because the elastic waistband on some of the other brands always seem like they squeeze my baby too much. But pampers fits well without leaving marks on the skin. But my favorite part of this diaper, even compared to some of the other pampers is that this one smells good! I mean really good! Lol kinda like the addicting baby powder or baby lotion smells. Sometimes I am holding my baby and get a whiff of the diaper and I love it! Lol"
1,"This idea was interesting on their earlier albums. If I listen to Oui ten times, I can't recall a single song, or even a single idea. Nothing here is memorable. It's sonic wallpaper. If you like this record, you sure are in luck. There are thousands of boring, fungible records like this released in the mid-60s from Brazil, France, etc. This is not to say that all of this type of stuff is worthless. Rather, now that the Sea and Cake's output is an emotionally devoid genre exercise, there are many other mediocre examples to collect and savor. I'm sure most of them are similarly ""positive,"" as our reviewer friend from Venezuela found Oui to be."
1,"I've been following this series all the way from its beginning with the Empire of the East series and I was extremely disappointed with the seemingly rushed way this one was written. Egad, what a goofy way to explain the Emperor figure. I was hoping for an intelligent tie in back to the Empire of the East premise, but ah well. The rest of the series is great."
1,"I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
1,Thought it was poorly written. The story was long & boring. Thought I would try her to find new writers. will not buy again.
2,"I rented this DVD online and was on the edge of my seat,glued to the screen and never blinked until the end! I hit title repeat right away and went amazon to buy one and gift-click four more to web friends.I will remember this film forever!If Run Lola Run was up for a little golden man it would expose the others as impotent,unoriginal bits of trash."
1,"This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping."
2,"I LOVE his new album! I knew that there was no way he could disappoint with a voice as beautiful and as powerful as his! MY FAVORITE SONG IS ""THE WAY""!!! I hope RCA makes this his new single! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE every song on this CD. I have never been so pleased with an album in my life. I totally respect Clay for taking a stand to have his CD made his way. After all, we fell in love with HIM, HIS style, HIS way. RCA doesn't need to change him, just give us Clay as he is! Some critics have referred to him as ""Gourment Vanilla"", in that case, gimme a triple scoop! :)I LOVE YOU CLAY & WILL SUPPORT YOU ALWAYS!!!Hugs,Shawna Wheeler,Central MaineSeat #207 on the Clay Train"
1,Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.
1,the author uses a great inspiring event to sneak in at the end of his story his personal perverted idea of morality..this book iwould describe as a piece of garbage..i assinged my copy to the garbage disposal where it belongs....
2,Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.
2,"I feel so sad because I can't find the Boys air choir's CDs in China.But I bought them when I saw them on Amazon by friend's help.Oh,their voices are so beautiful!In fact,5 stars is really really not enough for their CDs!And there is a question I really need your help:Why don't you have their 3-CD box set named ""Angel's Music Box""(It's really a beautiful box set!) or their 3rd album ""Air""? I trust Amazon could get them!"
2,Elder is very talented and I know that he will go far in his musical career. Congrats! from Mari at SourceOne!
1,"I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
2,Great series featuring the beginnings of Las Vegas. Dennis Quaid is delightful as the Sheriff and I gotta love the mobsters too.
1,"Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."
1,"This leaves your skin dry & not lumenescent like the other neo strata aha lotion. Tingles must work, but your skin does not look smoother afterwards."
1,"I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."
2,"This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans. It was a clever plot to plant a body with rank, papers, and identification in a location that was backed by information of tides, sea currents, etc. There was the usual anxious feelings of being discovered especially when the Germans decided to send a spy to England to verify whether this person really existed. The plot becomes more tense when he confronts the woman whose picture was found on the body along with a love letter!"
2,Cities Of The Red Night is one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The novel has different storys that as the novel progresses intertwine. The books presents situations that are unbelievable but because of Burroughs genius you are convinced of that they are happening in a world not too far from are own. I think he was trying to show the questionableness of what is presented to us as reality. This book also has some of the most vivid pictures and unforgetable lines that I have read. It is Burroughs masterpiece.
1,"Well I'm not sure what Pampers has done but these baby dry diapers are awful. My son has been in Huggies for a long time and I thought we would give these a try since the price is a pretty good deal through Amazon. I'm sorry I did. These are VERY thin diapers and the quality is extremely poor. These are definitely not the baby dry diapers I used on my older son a few years ago. These are completely white, no design at all. They used to have cute Sesame Street designs on them. The sides are not very stretchy and the diaper easily gets pushed down by clothing. We have had leaking at night because of this. Also, when the diaper has been on for a while (like at night) it's like the diapers shreds a bit around the leg openings. I assume this is due to rubbing against clothing for extended periods of time. I will NOT be buying these again. I'm sorry I bought such a big box since most of these will go to waste. Pampers Cruisers however, are great."
2,"I absolutely love these diapers! My daughter is 13 months old now and I cannot think of more than 1 or 2 times these have ever leaked. Even when she sleeps through the entire night and wakes up soaked, they hold an enormous amount of liquid!I tried the cruisers once, now that my daughter can run around, but I like the baby dry still. I find that the stretchy waistbands allow the diaper to fall down when she's active, but maybe that's not the case with everybody. Since these are looser around the stomach they also seem more comfortable, and my daughter doesn't rip them off immediately like some of the other stretchy brands."
1,"I was really looking forward to this title on blu ray, I already own the dvd, But it wont play on my player which is less that a year old. Buyer beware!"
2,"Disclaimer, I am a Japanese, I have eaten rice since I was a baby; therefore, I can tell you if the rice is really authentic or not. No matter what a great Japanese sushi joint is, if the rice isn't perfected, it ruins the sushi. So I really wanted to buy a superb rice cooker (without super price) and I can sincerely say ""This Is It!""Compared to the old rice cooker we have been using, the difference is noticeable. Each rice grain looks standing up and it looks beautiful (and tasty). I only tried regular/sushi but when I made sushi using the mode, it came out great too. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
2,"I started to buy the book at the bookstore and put it down -- on several trips. But, it kept drawing me in. Finally, I ordered it, and I am enjoying it very much. I find myself going back to it repeatedly -- picking it up when I finally sit down with some decaf at the end of the day or when I'm looking for an idea for a particular room. There's a lot here -- and it's fun to read, too."
2,I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again. Perhaps it's how cavalier Constantine is about eternal consequences. It is certainly tongue in cheek.
2,Loved this book as well. The movies as always stray from the book- I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters.
2,This is a flawless film about the true atrocities of the Vietman War and one mans struggle to find justice for the innocent. Penn and Fox give first class performances in the film not to mention the brilliant supporting cast. This film is far superior to others of the genre.
1,"No plot,waste of time and money in this 'Disney Porn' flick with ugly girls and stupid story line,Stay away!!!"
1,WOULD NOT RESPOND TO ANY OF THE 4 E-MAILS THAT WERE SENT INQUIREING ABOUT MY PURCHASE! IGNORED ME WHEN I TOLD THEM TO CANCIL MY PURCHASE AND REFUND MY MONEY!
2,Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist. Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large. Looking to down size soon!
2,"Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."
1,"In all the years of my life, I'm sure I've never heard such an awful musical. No wonder it was a flop! The story is ridiculous, the songs are silly and the music is incredibly bad. It makes COCO, BIG or LI'L ABNER ( a trilogy of disastrous music) sound like WEST SIDE STORY. Among the ten worst Broadway musicals of all times, this one has the honor to be TOP 1!"
2,"It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
2,"This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie."
2,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's book's and I wait eagerly for the next to come out. When I start reading these books, I forget all about my home, husband even my troubles. I love her characters and especially the one's like in ""The Bride"", which is my favorite of her books. But they all are great. She is my favorite author!!!"
1,"J'ai achet un Sansa View 16gB pour $200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie  peine, et la batterie vient de mourrir. L'estimation pour la rparation et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgr son excellente sonorit, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile  comprendre, parfois il gle...  viter!"
2,"I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended."
2,These Pampers have been a steady part of our baby's diaper regimine since birth. I find the product above average with the only complaint the occasional torn tab.
2,"I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
1,"I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day."
2,"Dali is a great beginner's book to him. I love his art, but am not really a huge or knowledgeable art fan.Chock full of pictures and a little history it was a great buy. No I know what the names of his art is and can start looking for his prints."
1,"I wish I had bought the Roget's International version. There are so few synonyms in this thesaurus--and if I want definitions, I'll use the dictionary. Synonyms: worthless, useless, stink-o"
1,these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
1,"Don't buy into the ""coolest album"" reviews, if you are into something heavy. I was referred to this group thanks to their advertised proximity to Slipknot's death-metal grind-core. I also heard ""Chop Suey"" on the TV.You can imagine my disappointment, when niether of the songs on the album, was as impressive as ""Chop Suey"", nor System of a Down's overall style corresponded with my expectations for it to be some death-metal hardcore.Basically, the songs are not that bad, but ONLY if you're into rock, or some oriental, armenian-arabic mix with horrible and meaningless lyrics and a blend of music styles. However, if you're looking for something heavy and killer, I'd say it's best to go for either Slipknot's ""IOWA"" or Slayer's ""God Hates Us All"", and leave this album to kindergarden rocker-kiddies."
2,"Please do not categorize this band as they will elude any classification you attempt. That's the essence and beauty of music that's carefully woven and passionately performed.Dredg is an anomale and I pray they stay true to their pursuit and void all ""commercial"" temptations lured by record execs a.k.a. SATAN. Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH I FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE."
2,This book was great! Lots of old Dear Abbey letters with background information on the thoughts that were behind the answers.
1,The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history.The books is misleading in that regard.
1,"After hearing this was the best Keanu movie I decided to go see this movie to see what I thought. But this movie was a complete bore. I fell asleep 3 times during the movie, It did not even scare me, I was checking my watch about 15 minutes in. It's supposed to make you scream, but I didn't. I laughed."
1,"It is hardly worth commenting on the quality of the film, in this case, since the DVD is so terrible. The packaging states that the film is ""restored and enhanced"". Baloney. It also claims that the DVD contains a whole heap of special features. Double baloney. It contains none, not even an interactive menu. The sound and vision are probably as bad as I have ever seen on a DVD. You can watch this film on You Tube and enjoy better quality. Amazon should not be peddling such rubbish."
2,"Bonnie 'Prince' Billy (aka Will Oldham) creates the scariest take on country music imaginable. In fact, this could easily be labelled 'goth country'.His lyrics are intensley personal and his voice a deep and dark wonder. His songs are carefully crafted and arranged in an obscure warmth and frailty.On some occasions the songs creep along steadily, on others errupt into soaring climaxes of double tracked vocals on the brink of collapse. These climaxes don't play on the usual tricks of severe dynamic change or string sections, but rather involve escalations in emotive force that ripple through you.Will Oldham is a master songwriter, and an expert at creating sound collages and textures not usually associated with country music."
1,"Please if you are looking for good time to pass watching movies, for god sakes don't watch this one, you're going to lose your time and money, it is so stupid, it's boring, the plot and story are horrible, the characters are bad, I read the comic and I thought the movie was going to be cool, but it was really, really bad, I only enjoy 10 minutes of it, it is going to bore you too, I can assure you that."
1,"I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog."
1,"I thought this was suppose to be the authentic headband, instead they sent a bootleg one that looks like s**t!! My 4 year old cousin could make a better looking bootleg headband than this.save your money and buy some sheet metal, get someone to cut it, then get them to imprint the symbol and scratch, then glue it on to some black faric"
2,"when I was growing up, during the week before Thanksgiving, I would pull out my copy of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' and would watch it constantly until Christmas, its one of my FAVORITE holiday movies of all time. I recently started my own tradition with my little ones by introducing them to this movie, and each year as the holidays start to arrive they beg me to pull it out and we watch it every day until Christmas."
2,"I was loyal to Pampers until Costco had a deal on Huggies and i decided to give Huggies a shot. I was not disappointed, but, the biggest difference between the two brands is that Pampers are MUCH SOFTER than Huggies. Pampers felt more like fabric while Huggies were very plasticy and felt like an itchy material. HOWEVER, huggies are much more absorbent and dont get as bulky as pampers. But, i put comfort over size of the diaper and I love pampers."
2,What a GREAT cd!!! I love listening to Clay over and over and over again!! WOW!!! Great job!!!! Thank you so much for making this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"My son, who is a skater, needed something to repair his favorite skate shoes, duct tape just didn't look good! He saw a video recommending Shoo Goo, it sounded like just the thing we needed to fix his shoes, so we tried it. It worked great, but I wish that I had chosen the clear, as I chose black and the result was less than I expected. I will definitely buy this product again, but I will choose clear instead of black!"
1,"Sadly, Gus Van Sant has stopped directing movies. Instead he has become a supervisor of filming. In the DVD supplemental documentary, the cast goes on and on about how wonderful it was to get to be so creative and work without a script. They rave about how much they loved the improvisation and about how great it was that they were CREATING a work of art. In the end, they didn't create anything but a nauseating bore.I turned the subtitles on just so I could understand what ""Blake"" was muttering (it wasn't worth reading so I turned them back off). The film tries to offer insight into the Kurt Cobain like character but I fail to see how watching him make Macaroni and cheese or crawl around on the floor for five minutes or mumble unitelligable monologues offers an audience anything. GET OVER YOURSELF GUS and start making real films again instead of trying to pass this garbage off as 'ART"""
2,"If your a definite Ripper buff this book is worth reading. It presents interesting facts, as to who just might be the Ripper. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in looking into the mind of a very psychotic man!"
2,"For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL."
1,"I purchased this item, as advertised, with Japanese subtitles to watch with friends who do not speak English. When I received the movie and put it in to watch it, it DOES NOT have the Japanese Subtitles. It was very disappointing."
2,"I'd give this 4.5 if I could. After the horrible Batman & Robin, this movie I entered with curiosity and skepticism. Would I be disappointed again by my favorite hero? A resounding 'NO!'. When I saw this movie, I saw Batman like I never saw him before in live-action. The moment he lifted up the corrupt Flass and told him 'Swear to me!', Batman was back and bigger & badder than ever. Nolan became my hero ever since. He is truly a master at his craft. Batman Begins single-handedly resurrected my favorite hero and I couldn't be happier. :)"
2,"Este libro es tan preciso que que es casi increible. Mis companeros de trabajo, vecinos, y familiares me llaman a consultar sus suenos porque siempre el significado descrito en este libro acerta tan increiblemente que he tenido que comprar unas cuantas copias para regalar. Al principio no le daba mucha importancia del significado de mis suenos pero luego me comence a dar cuenta de que todo me sucedia justo como lo describia este diccionario de los suenos. Ahora hasta mis 3 hijos estan todos fascinados.Mercedes, Florida, USA"
2,I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running. All 3 have worked without problem (sometimes the cord comes loose so you have to check that it is tight). No LED on the connector to indicated charging as with the original Apple adapter. Won't work on the new Intel MacBook or MacBook Pro.
2,"This ball is made of thick and durable plastic -- seems more heavy-duty than the balls at my gym. I use it as an office chair in addition to using it for exercises. The hand pump worked fine. I followed the instructions and filled the ball half way, left it overnight and completed filling it the next day. All-total, filling the ball took only 15 minutes. They provided very clear instructions on how to measure the filled ball. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the instructions mentioned a bicycle pump needle attachment that wasn't included in my box."
1,"The printer produces crisp, clear black and white pages. The efficiency of toner usage isn't too bad.But I soon started having major problems with my computer system--all peripherals using USB ports stopped being recognized by my Dell Dimension 2400 running Windows XP. What finally fixed the problem? Disconnecting the HP printer. With the printer installed, nothing else connected to a USB port worked except the printer. With the printer removed, everything worked fine. Other (borrowed) printers hooked up to the computer worked just fine and did not cause the system-wide problems.I tried downloading a variety of device drivers and patches from HP, none of which solved the problem. I finally had to get another printer--foolishly I bought another HP device (a C4280 All-in-One--look for my review on that item) because they employ some people I know. A mistake on my part. In addition, HP doesn't make a Mac-compatible driver for this printer."
2,"I TAPED THE SHOW THE NIGHT IT AIRED WHILE IT WAS TAPING I WAS AT THE SHOW, TOO HOT, MISS JANET TORE IT UP. EVERYONE WAS SINGING WITH HER. IT WAS SO LOUD, SOMETIMES YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR IT, BUSTA WAS THERE, T-BOZ, AMONG ALOT OF CELEBS WHO WERE THERE, LISTEN, ENOUGH WITH THE TALK, JANET IS TOO FIERCE, GET THE TAPE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
2,"totally awesome, this show is great, season three is kinda short though, only like 10 episodes at 10 minutes each, so not too long, but still halarious and unique."
2,"I loved looking at this book. It covered a lot of variety of types of chests and provided interesting historical and culture facts, as well as personal stories for specific chests. The pictures to text ratio is perfect. I wish there was a little more information on consrtuction--there was some useful information on types of construction for the wood itself, but I would have liked to see information on materials/woods used, latches, locks, handles, and strapping/corners. Still, I am very happy with my purchase."
2,The video quality is outstanding. Watching this video gives the viewer a glimpse of 3 very interesting cities as seen by Rudy Maxa. The video definitely entices the viewer to want to visit these cities. It is a great travel video.
2,"The movie has wonderful characters, well played. Every one of them. The story line of finding and maintaining loving relationships within a loyal family is quite special."
1,"At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist."
1,"These were so tiny I could just get them over four fingers. Box says ""one size fits most"". Most what? teenage girls? (I'm not a large man, I'm a petite adult woman, fit wasn't even close.)It's really appalling that amazon doesn't a MODICUM of info for items like this (like what's the diameter, the fact that there's NO stretch factor built into these at all.I've learntt my lesson. go to web sites that provide some info for purchases of this kind."
2,"This book is short but covers SO many issues in statistics. I am almost guaranteed to use it when I teach intro stats or econometrics. My only issue is that the references are outdated and the language isn't concise enough. That being said, all the points are still super relevant."
1,"Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer."
1,"This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."
2,worth what you pay for saved lots buying big i will keep buying bulk when it comes to diapers thanks
2,"I enjoyed the book, however, at times, I thought it was slow and very predictable. Sometimes it felt as if the author was dragging the storyline out to add length to the book. On the other hand, it was an easy enjoyable read."
1,"My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
2,"This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome."
1,"I did learn things I didn't know about 1969 Woodstock. But this DVD uses too much video from the oringial movie. There's hours and hours of film that was shot sitting in some Hollywood vault somewhere that could be used. If you enjoyed the original movie you don't really need to buy this one. To much of the same thing over again, althrough the short interviews where a nice touch."
2,"Don't get me wrong; Clay has an AMAZING voice. There's a reason this guy was #2 on American Idol. But his songwriters need a shot of creativity. His lyrics, though heartfelt I'm sure, are about the same generic topics that every pop star sings about: love and loss. These are generally great topics, but not when it's the whole CD. I hope his next CD, if there is one, will have more variety concerning his song topics. I'm still giving this CD 4 stars because his voice just blows the majority of the faults away. I'd buy his Christmas CD if I had the money."
2,"This book sat unread on my shelves for a while, and now I can't believe it didn't actually leap off the shelf into my hands to MAKE me read it; it's so utterly fascinating and engrossing that I haven't been able to put it down. I was expecting some dry history and feminism; this is a fascinating first-person portrait (or rather, five first-person portraits) of political struggle, social norms, everyday life, and revolution from the writings of five very literate, engaging writer/revolutionaries.I hardly know how to review a book like this (since I can't talk about plot or about structure of arguments, as it's first-person memoirs), but it's been among the most worthwhile 250 pages of my reading life."
2,"It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book."
2,"It has been a few years since I read Charms for the Easy Life, but when I saw there were no reviews I had to leave one. The main characters in this book are three generations of Southern women. They are strong-willed, very intelligent women and they will make you laugh and cry. Writing this review makes me want to go find the book and re-read it"
2,"This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!"
2,"My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas, i have to say at first (without using it) i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing. my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you'll have that lol. Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol"
