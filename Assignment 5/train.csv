1,Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn't charge it without the cycle turning itself off. The size & fit were good; it just wouldn't take a charge.
2,"...but a very good pick anyway! As usual Don Caballero manage to hover miles above the average indie-record. This time tough the music is less aggressive, the drumming less furious and the pace is overall calmer. Don't get me wrong, they haven't limped, they still spark with energy and creativity, only the've become more ""mature"". For those who don't know anything about the band I'll just say that they find themselves between shellac and tortoise, between arty improvisation (which most people call post-rock) and noise-rock."
2,"Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. As a character, Mr. Timothy is drawn with a complexity that defies prediction of his actions. The two children he partners with feel true, with the charm and courage that Dickens gave the children he wrote about. One cares what happens to all of them, and I assure you, much does happen. I found myself savoring the last few chapters, dreading that time when I would reach the back cover and part company with this fascinating group."
1,"I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
2,"To Pearl Jam Lion, I really don't appreciate being threanted withmy life because I like a particular artist, or a different typeof music that is obviously not the music you enjoy.It is peoplesuch as yourself that help make this a more freightening planet.So I have forwared your ""review"" to the Center for Hate Crimes asa possible person to watch. I also forwared it to the Center forPeople with Eratic and unusual Behavior. There is also an agencyfor terroristic threats by person or by proxy, especially overthe internet. So I am glad you got printed and you have yourselfa nice little day."
1,"It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of ""talk a lot but say nothing"". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass."
2,"I'm an avid fan of biblical historical fiction...I love the way she brings this story to life and keeps you in suspense. Details are clear and accurate....beyond that, you're drawn immediately into the story, the character's thoughts/emotions/motivations/lives, and hoping they choose to follow God. My biggest acclaim for a book in this genre is having read it that i find myself loving my God even more, seeking harder after Him, understanding just a little more, and wanting more of Him! My faith is encouraged! Definitely recommend!"
1,OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US READ IT AND WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!
1,"This film is nothing more that a cheap horror film. It's premise, using computer software to control ones mind is a weak plot line which, considering it is the central theme, could have been presented in a fashion that might have been semi-believeable. I don't know which would be worse, being controlled by the games in the movie, or having to sit through it."
2,"This is a really fun toy for kids when traveling. Both of my kids (10 & 13) had fun playing with it, and I recommended it to my parents who got one as well. It will keep kids amused for a good long time, and it makes them really think about a certain object. Good fun!"
2,This movie is very entertaining to both adults and children. It is a fun and witty movie that you can watch again and again and still have a good time with! I would highly reccomend getting the video
1,"Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
2,"This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."
2,"If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time."
2,"Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop put out a pretty impressive album which starts out great with the self named track Cali Iz Active. After that the lyricism and delvery is pretty good but not the best it could be. This album is still very impressive though with some great beats and appearances by some of the best in the business. Overall this album is better than Young Joc and his attempt at rap or other wannabe rappers from the ATL. This album is definitely worth your money."
2,I am a big fan of Clay and once again I say the producers of American Idol made a big mistake...Clays single was great but this is 100 times better....defientley one of the best CD's of 2003! Every Track is great..My Fav's: Every Track!!
1,"Right from the beginning, with track #1 (""New Life""), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on ""sweetness"". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on ""Speak and Spell"" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (""Puppets""), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (""Just Can't Get Enough""), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two ""pretty boy"" songs: #4 (""Boys Say Go!"") and #6 (""What's Your Name?""). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it."
1,"I don't own this, which is surprising because I love to ""discover"" new acts. You want to know why I didn't buy this? I don't think they should even be allowed to sell this garbage! ""When I get you all alone, I'm gonna take off all your clothes, ain't nobody gonna interupt my game."" I couldn't believe that a song like that could make it onto the airwaves. I know you'll make fun of ""Genie In A Bottle,"" but I don't care, it's innocent and cute when a girl does it. When a guy sings stuff like this, I want to throw a rock at 'em!"
1,"As we all have one time or another, had to read shakespeare in school for English class. That was my reason for this, my son needed it for school. I'm just glad it was available. He needed to Kill a Mokingbird, it wasn't available for Kindle."
1,"ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
1,"A faint excuse for hard rock, in any case, would surpass System of a Down's awful music, and their CD ""Toxicity"" is no exception. The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion."
1,"This is the worst film I have ever seen made by and about Chinese Americans. It may be of interest to people of mixed Asian ancestry since most of the cast is of mixed race. The premise may have been taken from an episode of ... Little House on the Prairie(!) wherein Charles helps a woman fake her own funeral to bring her ""distant"" kids home to see her."
1,"This movie plays as if it was directed by the camera.It looks cheap is hopelessly incoherent.Stick with ""Close Encounters""."
2,"Mercy starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final surprise.Lots of fun to read, lots to think about. Mercy was hard to put down. I enjoyed the Palma character.I would recommend to anyone who likes a good detective story. I have passed it to several friends who also enjoyed it."
2,I use those diapers for years. They are good for my daughter and other babies. This one is bought as a gift for our friend.
1,"i can't live without carbohidrates! if you want to lose your mind, follow this diet; the pills dr bernstein prescribes for people who are addicted to carbohidrates, my doctor will not prescribe, i know this because he recomended me the high carb low fat diet to loose weight."
2,"After I watched this film I was ready to watch it again. This is a fantastic movie; if you love a great action packed film with a beautiful scenery and a wonderful story of courage, friendship and love. You will enjoy this film. With a love of history in it's truest form. Don't listen to the critics they never know what they are talking about I somtimes wonder if they even watch the films they talk about. Watch this film you will enjoy every sec. of it."
1,Tom Brokaw is not a gifted writer. He wrote this book in the same dry and simple style as he uses with his TV audience. The book is completely stripped of romance and soul for the sake of the lowest common denominator. I have met many WW2 veterans who tell stories woven with romance and heartbreak that bring tears to your eyes. This is not represented in any of the 4 page biographies of these common place heroes. Pure non-fiction at its most uninspiring.
1,"I have several ""Mr Coffee"" branded products which is why I chose this one. Have to say I am disappointed. My coffee gets luke warm then cold using this product which is disappointing. I would not recommend this product to others."
2,I live in Pennsylvania and I recently saw Corvus Corax play at the PA Ren. Fair. I was quickly in love with this bands music. I bought this cd at their show and it has quickly become one of my favorites. I love rare and uncommon music and this one sure pleased me. It amazes me how dedicated this band is and how each song sounds a bit differnt then the last. This is a great cd for anyone who likes music that is a bit differnt then everything else.
2,"I've read the play, the screenplay, have seen it performed and seen the movie and believe that Beautiful Thing is one of the best stories of our time. It is the story of two young boys from broken homes coming of age while dealing with the complexity of their growing feelings for each other. Some critics may say that Harvey has stereo-typed his characters and that may be true but who, in this day and age, DOESN'T fit into a stereo-type. In a world full of cynicism and repression, Harvey presents us with a story that gives everyone who reads his play or sees it performed a glimpse of hope within the darkness."
2,"Not only do i love the pampers brand because it fits perfect on my 1yr old but also it holds all her ""stuff"" lol the amount is amazing i didnt have to buy diapers for over 2 months!!"
1,"I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."
2,"Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition ""Technical Analysis 98"", this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
2,"I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have."
2,"Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!"
1,"When i first read the plot for this book, it sounded good. Maybe not original in the Zombie genre (i'v only found Sandman Slim Kill The Dead original in the genre). But god i did not expect it to kill me with boredom. I am a avid reader but i had to push myself to finish this book, it was slower than the undead it chronicled. Also i didn't care by the end of the book which of the main charters died...i was actually hoping for it . The mere thought of trying to read the others in the series... frightens me. Unless David Moody's style of writing changes and actually gets some life to it...i wont be reading further novels from him."
2,"This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!"
2,"A year ago, for schoolwork I had a choice to read this book, and I took it. Everyone said they're siblings said it was boring. Not so!!This was an excellent book, for pleasure reading and for learning about Colonial America. An great book for teachers to read with their students, too. Masterfully writen, a great book. I reccomend it."
1,"Does this guy tape record himself at night? For more grade school poetry, nonsensical statements, and Haiku's written by dumb people go out and get this CD ASAP."
1,"This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Not my sort of thing, so I probably never should have bought it in the first place."
2,"Once you accept the mumbo-jumbo elements of how Civil War veteran John Carter is transported to Mars, you can settle back and appreciate the remarkable fantasy world that Edgar Rice Burroughs describes. In a driving narrative that never lags, Burroughs succeeds in creating a multi-layered society rife with racial animosity and social unrest. Carter becomes the igniting spark, the focal point for societal change at all levels. This book is actually the first of a trilogy. Books two and three are ""The Gods of Mars"" and ""Warlord of Mars"" respectively. They are all excellent - so good you'll have trouble believing that they were written nearly a hundred years ago."
2,"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."
1,"I put them on at the doctor's office and the first time I had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. Otherwise, liked them very much."
1,"All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......"
1,"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
2,Best game ever buy it fun caracter switch select button item select R button Password mondo mountain XGVXHQWS. If you want to win consantraitI have 10 passwords the mondo mountain password is above.The best game ever $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it now worth the $$$$$$$$$$$$ buy it when you can!!!
2,"I'm not much of a ""hard rock"" fan. I enjoy it from time to time, but I mainly listen to Radiohead, older hip-hop, etc. But this album got me hooked.One day, many years after the release of Toxicity, I decided to check it out. Right after the first track, ""Prison Song"", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was. Serj Tankian's interesting [but awesome] vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen. Check it out.-Jeff"
2,WOW!! This cd is outstanding from start to finish! Every song is great! I can't even pick one song that i really don't care for. Good job Clay....your first cd is worth 5 STARS. Buy this today!
1,"Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."
1,"I also agree that it's like scotch tape. I tried several strips, peeling from multiple angles, and none of them worked. Instead, I got a swelling eyelid the next day. This product doesn't work at all."
2,"What a good movie. However as good as it is ,it sometimes takes on a child-like sense of humor.... The acting is ok. But i wish they had a stronger story line...The guy who plays satan is great. And Many of the parts are jaw dropping..... I give it 4 out of 5 stars,,,,I do say buy it because when you see it you will want to see it again......"
2,"I bought this warmer for my desk at work. It arrived on Saturday so I gave it a test run on the weekend. It works great, keeps my tea perfectly warm. One word of warning though, if your mug has a wide base to it, it might not fit on the plate. Other than that it just great. I'm very happy."
1,"The sound quality is good. However, do your research. There is a design flaw in the headband whereby the plastic covering on the sides will crack after 2+ years of use. Turns out, after contacting bose, the headphones are neither factory nor user serviceable. You can exchange them in for a new pair at $100 cost. That's right, if anything breaks whatsoever, you are expected to buy a whole new pair. So instead of just stocking spare plastic headband parts for $2, bose wants you to pay $100 for another pair once these fall apart. I don't know about you, but for $300, I expected them to last a bit longer."
1,"In Hawaiian, this means Dirty, dirt, or filth, I think this word best describes this album. I bought this album thinking I would hear a wonderful singer and voice, but the only thing I can say is that screaming monkeys at the zoo sound better. All of his songs sound the same, kind of like a broken record. ""Invisible"" and ""I Will Carry You"" sound like the kind of screaming and moaning you'd hear at a mental institution. It seems his music only appeals to 4 to 14 year old girls, who have all the time in the world to sit in front of their computer and pine eternal about Clay's music. Perhaps when most of them grow up, they will realize what a waste of time this guy is. If you want to hear great music....listen to Iz Kamakawio'ole."
2,"Okay - I know the price is high and that's why it took me months to order this rice maker. I have now been using it for about a year and it is one of the best purchases I ever made - worth every penny! It has perfectly cooked everything I have tried (my fav = sticky rice), long grain, short grain, brown, white, sweet, even oatmeal. I use it several times a week and have never had a problem. It still looks and works like the day I bought it. It plays charming little songs to signal the start and end of the program and keeps the rice hot and moist for hours. One tip - don't place the top plate in the dishwasher. I ignored the instructions and put it is the dishwasher - it still works, but it is discolored."
2,This is a great CD and all I can say is that if you're a fan of the first album....you have to get this one.
2,This is a classic CD set...I will keep forever and pass on to my kids. Love it!!!!
2,"Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more! He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read. I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it, too, for the students' sake!"
1,My costume was a small and didn't fit my 5 year old wayyyy to tight and it dd t come with the belt!!!
2,"This 4x memory card has 492 pages of memory. The only drawback is that you select the active page with two slide switches. Not bad if you understand binary, but a little hard for 7 year olds."
2,"This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
1,"I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment)."
1,"Watching this, you just KNOW that important bits were edited out to protect the current reputation of Ms. Hurley. The ending just comes out of left field - adding to the impression that something was taken out. There are hints of a more than sisterly relationship between the two female leads but not enough to shore up the finale. The only saving grace is the price is right!"
2,"...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!"
1,"Call me a philistine, but ""Candide"" did more to confuse than enlighten me. Yes, I know the story is deliberately far fetched, almost surreal, but it still failed to make an impact even when considering the work in this context. Absurdity can only travel so far.My sad but brief review is that ""Candide"" is less meaningful today that it was at the time of its writing. No, I have not found the meaning of life but nor has Voltaire."
1,I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. Even NHL Face-off is better than NHL 2k3. The graphics are only average and the controls are horrible. It feels like the players are skating in sand. The replays are ok but this game doesn't even have a create-a-player option. Sega should stick to football and basketball. Sorry Sega but I miss your Genesis games!
2,"Well my previous review for this card was not good. But I just built a new, faster computer and put the Radeon to the test again. My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also. Worth the money-now that is."
2,I love pampers diapers. I have two boys and have used pampers almost exclusively. They have fantastic leak protection and fit my boys better than other brands.
2,"An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above."
1,"Not good suction...It won't stay on the window...The temperature changes cause it to pop off, so it really is useless."
2,My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.
1,I never ordered this book so I can't possibly review it. I'm at a loss to understand how I'm connected to this title since I have never used the Kindle.
1,"Good fun movies and nice compilation but... Spiderman 2 and 3 do not offer any audio or subtitles in spanish. If like myself you need them, then don't buy this version. Look for each one individually for a version that has at least subtitles."
1,"The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply."
1,"During the first chapter of the book. It hooks you right away. From the moment the characters arrive at the barn it declines. If you have ever seen ""Pinky and the Brain"" these are the characters. Except Lennie is more stupid than Pinky! My two year old cousin has more common sense than Lennie. The book is highly illogical."
1,"I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply. The reply was to go to their update center and to renew. I sure wasn't going to pay again for something I only had for two months and its suppose to last for a year.I'll be going back to my trusted Norton Antivirus, it may be slow but at least I only have to buy it once a year."
2,"I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep."
2,"I got this album for 99 cents in a thrift store, and it's the greatest deal I've ever come across. the album sounds absolutely amazing. there are so many nuances that you just don't get with the CD. Id listen to it over and over. I'm in love with this album. Each track is amazing."
1,"My 2 and 1/2 year old loves Bob, so he played with this for a little while. Tired of it quickly, as the magnets are not strong enough to hold blocks together to have any real pretend play. Seriously, every time he tries to open the door for Bob, the whole house falls down. The blocks are so light weight that his wooden block set is more fun to build a house with. Buy the Bob the Builder lego set and stay away from this set!"
1,"This movie must have been made as a pilot for the series that followed. This would explain the lack of wit and social commentary as well as the toning down of the violence. This movie had a serious continuity problem. Nobody seems to have noticed that in the first two movies Robocop had a son, yet in the 3rd movie during the flashbacks he had a daughter. This was truly a bad sequel."
1,"I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours. Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort. Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong. The screen quality is just plain awful. If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all. You'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing. It's simply a cheap lousy screen.The rest of the unit is fine. The construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?"
2,A writing style that was prevalant in its time. Very much the boys adventure style with the hero being the best at everything. A real pleasure to read a simple direct adventure yarn.
2,"This work is an exhaustive study of the Luftwaffe's inventory from 1931 - 1945. Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended."
2,"The Bad Boys of Hollywood as you have never seen them before.This special breed lit up the screen with blockbuster films and their private lives did not pale in comparison.A gossip gourmets delight!Newly discover footage that will spotlight these lovable rogues as they lived out our fantasies.Marlon, Brando, Errol Flynn, Robert Mitchum, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, James Dean, Sean Penn, Steve McQueen, John Bulusi are all here!"
2,I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
2,"In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983,following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefall,whose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs:WHAT ABOUT LOVE is a hard-rocker featuring Starship's Grace Slick on background vocals. IF LOOKS COULD KILL was a minor hit. NEVER is another hard-rocker. THESE DREAMS is considered adult comtemporary. NOTHING AT ALL sounds cool. All the other songs are very good."
1,These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1.99 a pair--(commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores).
1,"I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the ""mood"" is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main ""character"" of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."
1,"I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one"
1,"I am not able to say that Erich Fromm's book The Art of Loving really is about the art of loving. The only important message I was able to digest is that loving is something you do, not something which happens to you. I do not follow how this book could be labeled as practical when it does not really contain any program at all, rather, it contains a lot of unwarranted criticism of modern society.The book contains many easy to disprove statements. Also, Fromm does not bother to explain how he came to his conclusions - it's like a mathematical textbook that contains theorems and claims without any proofs or defitions. In other words, there are not many lines of reasoning to be found. All in all, I am disappointed with the quality of Fromm's thinking."
2,This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i'm 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with
1,"hmmm...just think....Noel, a brilliant man, maKING A CD that is just crap. What happened!!!!! I can't believe it....over played solos....awful lryics!!!!! Just when you think they could make another brilliant album, they make a crappy album. Haaa...just think.... 4 yrs ago Blur was being called the has beens because Oasis brokoe the US but blur did not. Well....who are the has beens now??? Well Oasis... all I cam say is RETIRE!!!! Geesh, for Beatle wanna bees, I would expect better."
2,"This stuff is amazing! I apply it a bit more liberally than they recommend and I always use Sassy disposal bags for the dirty diapers, but this spray is a lifesaver...especially if you are out & about. It can save you much embarrassment. Our baby has a partial intestinal blockage, which makes her diapers smell like something caustic and this spray even masks that!! We keep a small bottle in the diaper bag and a large one at both changing tables."
1,It doesn't cooperate and isn't very user friendly. It feels like it takes forever of shaking until it finally finds a virus for you to fight. Very annoying...especially when mom is fussing at me to stop shaking it.
1,"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
1,"As a keyboard protector, it works fine.Unfortunately, the material seems to interact with the LCD display to leave marks.It has stained my screen with rectangles (one from each protected keycap).Water does not completely remove the marks on the screen - they appear to bepermanent."
1,"I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough."
2,"Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it. If you can only read one book your entire life, make it this one. It is the masterpeice of the modern era from the man I would consider its finest writer."
1,"This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!"
1,"In this book, Davy does something bad and has to make amends for it before his mother gives him a loving hug.As a mother trying to teach love and forgiveness to my young son, I was horrified at the moral of withholding love from a child to ""teach"" a lesson. The book is off our reading list and in the trash can."
2,"These guys definitely have it. No joke. I've heard a lot of modern ""blues"" bands that are really really bad. Usually bands like this genuinely love blues music and want to play some blues themselves. You see them on-stage and they're going thru the motions and you can admire them for being so passionate about really bad songs, but you leave completely unsatisfied. This album is everything I could wish for from a modern blues bands. You will not be disappointed."
1,This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
2,"Of Mice And Men is one of my alltime favorite books. It is so thought provocking, and is a book that should be read by every one. So If You haven't read this book, do yourself a favor, and read it!"
1,"Product arrived promptly and in good condition. However, the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones. If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault"
1,After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
2,This is a workhorse table with a guarantee---how can you go wrong? Mine are used in a pottery studio where students can work on their clay creations. Owned mine for more than five years and can't even think of a problem with these tables. They clean up well and are very sturdy. I like the leg design because I have yet to stub a toe on these tables. Don't hesitate to get this line of products; you won't be sorry.
1,"I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."
2,"Thomas Beecham (1879-1961) is not thought of today as a major Wagner conductor, but he did conduct a number of Wagner's music dramas at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and has recorded a number of Wagner overtures and preludes, including this collection.Although the early- mid 1950s sound will be an issue for some, I urge serious collectors to consider this recording, as it shows Beecham's mastery of Wagner. A great alternative to other Wagner collections of Bohm (DG), Karajan (EMI), Furtwangler (Naxos Historical and EMI), Bernstein (Sony) and Ormandy (Sony).Highly recommended."
2,My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!
1,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
1,"This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."
1,"This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
2,This movie was so funny! It's like the best movie ever. The movie is better than the t.v. show. It's SpongeBob but with more laughter in it. So I would give this movie 5 stars!Edward Park
2,"Another installment in the Texas Cattleman's Club series - Silhouette Desire #1547 (November 2003) - ""Entangled With A Texan"" by Sara Orwig. Book summary from back cover:Tied up in knots! How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."
2,"Do you have a passion for animals? If so, you'll inhale this book. The authors heartfelt emotions can be felt on every page. He clearly adored the animals he cared for over the decades. He described the colorful European countryside, the diverse pets, and the people who owned them in fine detail. Each story is accompanied by an ink sketch that added some warm visuals. My favorite stories were of ""Tricki Woo"", ""Judy The Nurse Dog"", ""Granville Bennett"", and ""Cigar."" What was nice is that since the stories were broken up, you could not lose your place when you took a break. Yet, I only took one because this was a fast page turner. I have had several dogs in my life and these are the most honest depictions of dog behavior I have read thus far. All animal lovers will enjoy this. Time to hug my dog and adopt another."
2,"This is a great book with a whole new way of approaching running. Some of it I intuitively have known and practiced. A lot of it is a completely different way of ""practicing"" running."
1,"my scanner hasn't worked since the day i took it out of the box, installed the software, and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing! looks like it's a dud. lol."
2,"Finally, after over a decade of lackluster singers, Clay Aiken has arrived! His debut album, Measure of a Man, is unarguably one of the best albums of 2003. This album does not disappoint from the opening song to the last. Clay delivers every song to near perfection. His powerful instrument, his voice, resonates through each track. You will find it very hard not to listen to it, from beginning to end, over and over again. If i had to sum this album up in just one word, that word would have to be ""outstanding""!"
1,"What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
1,"Yes, I'm a zombie fan, both real and pseudo. Still, this book is a bit of a snore.Now if the book is about people in survival mode instead, then Moody doesn't seem to understand individual differences and the broad range of ""fight or flight"" reactions at all. All I can figure is that his characters must reflect his own truncated response. And where are the characters with the truly good problem-solving skills? Weak.This was like the time I saw the ""Blair Witch Project"" and was puzzled when the characters kept wandering around in circles. I'm an urbanite and still I kept thinking, ""Why don't you just follow the river back?"" In ""Autumn"" because the evolving zombies seemed to best orient toward noise, I kept thinking ""Why don't you just come up with some sort of simple missile device to create noise and distract these suckers?"" Molotov cocktail, anyone?Real or pseudo, there are much better zombie stories out there."
1,"As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!"
2,"If SMB: The Movie hadn't been the first major film based on a video game, it would probably garner more favorable opinions. Think of all the terrible video game movies that came after it! Mario looks far superior in comparison.Overall, I ask that you put aside your vision of a Mario film and clear your mind of the traditional imagery in the games. You will see that Super Mario Bros. was a very unique take on a property that doesn't lend itself to live action film. I tip my hat to those involved in the actual creation & direction of the movie, since there was a lot of behind the scenes issues.Hopefully, we'll see an anniversary edition materialize in a year or so."
1,"Fairly decent ""junk"" reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."
2,"I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"
2,This album is definitely one of the most terrific ones in the jass history. The sound stucks in your brain and let you fly to an other dimension.Also the quality of this vinyl version is great.Enjoy.
1,"I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
1,"The dimensions of the miter slot are not provided for this item. Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4"" deep x 3/4"" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3"" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."
2,"This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!"
1,"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."
2,This is great dela because you save almost $8 on this box if you were to purchase 2 boxes at the store. Now we have diapers for twice as long for less money! Will buy again for sure!
2,"I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow"
2,It's Thomas! Kids love it. I can tolerate him better than Barney or those Wiggles. Still sounds so odd to hear George Carlin narrating a children's movie...
2,"This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an ""assembly required"" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included, so don't buy an extra chair separately!"
1,"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer ""The Red Baron."" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."
2,"This was a great movie, although not quite as good as the first one. I would still recommend for those Narnia lovers to buy it, just be prepared to be slightly confused from the skipping of books and information. It all makes sense at the end, but you may have to watch it several times for everything to fit with the first movie. If you've read the books, it's no problem, except if you're like me and haven't read the books since you were in 4th grade. Still good though, love to see where the kids end up."
1,"When new, these were great, but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time, years in fact. Batteries this old cannot be charged up again. You're just buying a paperweight!"
2,"Nuel Emmons is the author, so these are his words. He only translates into readable print what Charles Manson is trying to relate to us. I have no sympathy for Manson, being where he is, as he is a grown man and is responsible for his own actions. He cannot blame his childhood for the mistakes he made as an adult.However, I do feel sorry for Charles Manson, the child. Growing up, he was totally confused, and I do have sympathy for him at that stage of his life. However, anyone with even a SHRED of common sense, knows you cannot think like the adult Manson and get away with it for long."
2,"I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster"
2,Adam and Drew really do have chemistry together! This movie is funny and romantic at the same time. I've really enjoyed watching it!
1,"Be very careful in dealing with this kind of material! First of all , it does not work! I was having a very hard time..health, financial..especially financial. These books are not only a waste of time and money..things actually got much WORSE!"
2,I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn't get them to stay in. these made it work!
1,"I waited anxiously and patiently for the video release of Prince Caspian. As someone who has read the whole Narnia series, I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Yeah the special affects were cool, and most kids will probably like the movie. But this movie deviates so far from the original book that it would be easier to list the similarities between the two. Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis' books should not waste their time seeing this."
1,"My Panasonic over-the-range microwave only lasted 1.5 years before it died on me. Panasonic wanted me to uninstall it, bring it to them and pay too much to have it repaired. It wasn't nearly as good as my GE over-the-range microwave which lasted more than 10 years!"
1,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the ""New Testament"" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the ""guilty until proven innocent"" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."
1,"Got two kids have used tons of diapers from various brands big and small - but was never appalled at its quality like my experience with this one. These diapers invariably leak on a regular basis and seem to have very little absorption capacity. Its hard to believe that this comes from Pampers, I have been pretty satisfied with them in the past. I hope this is a one-off, but it does make me a little apprehensive picking up Pampers again."
1,"This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
2,"This is a fantastic life after death experience written by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it encouraged me tremendously after the recent death of my son, who had also proclaimed his faith in Christ before God took him. I enjoyed the book so much, I read it twice."
2,"It is extremely rare to see so many world famous super artists performing together in the same concert doing some of their greatest hits - Elton John, Sting, Mark Knofler, Carl Perkin, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Phil Colins etc. You must own this DVD before it is out of stock. I would have given it 5 stars should the audio recording be slightly better. Go and buy this one with confidence. I am sure you will not regret."
2,"i read this book a little over a year ago when i was 14, this book was so good and it was told like a story not just from some 3rd person view, i felt like i was in the books world it was that good, this book kept getting more and more intriging as i turned the pages i think if i remeber correctly i finshed the book in 4 days, cause it was so damn good... i hella recomend this book to everyone, pretty scary too and i liked the pictures"
2,"this book was amazing and truly touching . It is about courage, love, faith, and our American history. It gave another side of World War 2. It showed that you can find a friend in the most unusual places and that it is always good to look."
1,"and when i say this i dont mean it to be used as entertainment or for enjoyment. when i first heard chop suey i thought the band would be worth a shot. when i popped in the cd i thought my dad was yelling at me, but it was only the music. the album is nothing like chop suey, only one other song is remotely good #8 i think. i like bands like offspring greenday ect., even rob zombie & limp bizkit. so if u like that kind of music then dont waste your money on this recording of rythmless shouting. and when i say the album has one use, it makes a nice frisbee"
2,"Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. It's a story that will make your heart sink. This magnificent couple had such a strong love for each other. It was so strong that they died together. In the beginning it was crazy how they are enemies and they want to be together but it's hard to because what they are doing is wrong to their families. At the ending they died together with their love stronger than ever, it's a heartbreaking story, wishing that they would live happily ever after.I really enjoyed this story, although I do wish that they could have lived to be together and in love."
2,"This was purchased as a Holiday gift for our 2 1/2 year old. She is very artistic in nature, as are my other two older children (ages 9 & 11) and they all play together when this gets whipped out. It's great for when I need a little time to do some sewing to keep the kids busy for awhile.Sometimes mom gets in on the creative action as well, and then we end up playing for long times, strengthening our bonds.Much better than sitting in front of the TV or computer.The only subject I would mention that could use a little improvement is maybe an idea sheet, like a how to, to give the kids a jumping point on creativity with what is included in this package."
2,I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
1,"This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement."
1,"i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""I need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album."
1,"This movie is poor. Very poor. It seems like some art student got ahold of the idea to do a movie about Kurt, and ""went to town"" with the idea. This movie has NO dialog. I kid you not, NO dialog. I understand what they are trying to do... show all the ""strife"" and ""pain"" Kurt went through with his drug addiction, but this movie draws it out for hours... with no plot. And to any Kurt Cobain novice will have no idea what the hell is going with this movie."
2,"Measure of a Man is one of those rare CDs where every single song is worth listening to! A mix of uptempo pop and ballads, this CD provides a range of styles to showcase Clay Aiken's amazing talents and prove once and for all, that he is a true pop superstar.I'll be listening to this one until my player wears out!"
1,"I purchased Pampers Baby Dry size 4 thinking it was a good price for the Brand Name. However, only a couple hours after placing the diaper on my baby, it began to leak through the front panel. The diaper was hardly full, but my baby's clothes were damp. These diapers definitely don't make it through the night either. All the diapers in this box have been this way. Maybe my Pampers box was a just a lemon. Good luck."
1,"My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space."
1,"Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
2,"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."
2,"Young, Fresh and Strong Talent here! From start to finish this album carries lots of energy. Tracks ""En Mis Brazos"" & ""Si Me Dejas"" are guaranteed hits. Whether you appreciate musica latina and/or enjoy good music you cannot go wrong with this album. I am anticipating these melodies to hit the clubs and car tunes soon!"
1,"Till now I've never seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie, this would be the first. We kept hoping it would end and will never watch it again."
2,"The Saris bike rack worked out great. I had borrowed a three bike Saris rack from a friend and decided to get one for myself. I only needed a rack to carry two bikes so thats what I ordered. When it arrived I was taken aback by the fact it wasn't quite like my friends although it looked exactly like it in the online picture. It only had one upper arm rather then two like my friends. Over wise it was identical. I almost sent it back but decided to try it out instead. Glad I did because my concerns about stability with just one upper arm was quickly dispelled. Great rack, rock solid."
1,"Player 5150 is close to the top of my ""Eject Immediately"" heap of flicks.It's a wonder to me how a movie like this gets past a pitch meeting! Maybe an explanation is the lowering cost of actually making a movie - something excruciatingly evident in the low-budget look and feel here. A patchwork of cliche-rich dialog and awkward borrowing from other films, this DVD is barely watchable. NoPushover recommends not gambling on this one."
2,"A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'."
2,"First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed."
1,What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
1,"I have been trying to find videos I can play on my Amazon Prime Roku box for my kitties. I have one really great video, Feline Frolics, which I Highly recommend. This one, however, is terrible. It starts out with a bunch of ducks and goes on and on and on and on..with the ducks. The sounds are ok but get very annoying after awhile. They have, of all things, a turtle. ( blinks) I am not sure why they have a turtle..They also have a crocodile.. and only 1 short scene of an aquarium!! ~ and that one was at the end. The scenes are entirely too long to keep my cats attention and are exceedingly boring. I am SO glad I didn't purchase the full version. Do not waste your money..... Amazon please find more cat movies to show on PRIME.. I love the Frolics one!!!"
2,"Feinstein's books are always a good read and this one is no exception. If you want to know more about what it takes to put on a major golf tournament, this is your book."
2,It is a good headset in terms of clarity (incoming sound). Outgoing voice is a little low (according to some listeners). Battery life is fair.
2,Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!
2,I really loved this book! It has my second favorite pair of soulmates in it (Ash & Mary-Lynette being my favorite). This book reminds me a lot of my favorite show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I think they even mention the movie in the book... Anyway this book up there with my top 5 favorite L. J. Smith books. They are all so good that it is hard to decide an exact order. so if you haven't read it yet then I suggest that you do.
1,"I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."
1,"I bought this because I needed quick access to this classic for a paper I was writing. This is a very poor representation of this remarkable book; cheaply printed, no index -- junk! Don't buy it! totally useless for anything except a quick perusal by people who don't know any better!"
2,"joyful and scared by my absolute ignorance on the matter...This book is so complete, that I lost my fear, kept my joy and never needed another one!"
1,"How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else."
1,"I purchased this item last year and have used it about 5 times. While steaming some tamales last night, not only did the pot turn my oven covers completely black (currently soaking in baking soda and vinegar) but upon further review the bottom lip of the pot is completely separated from the remainder of the pot. What the heck? I am going to throw this in the dumpster now. Unless you guys will refund me. * After posting this I got a positive email from the company. Thank you guys"
2,"I received my zen garden yesterday, I really like it. For the price it is great quality. Also mine did not fall apart out of the box as others were saying. I was impressed with the packaging. For under $14 this is a great value. It is sitting on my desk at my office now."
2,I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
1,"I usually love Pampers, but the Baby Dry Pampers really irritated my little boy's skin. He didn't have any leaks but the angry red marks on his skin negated the leak free aspect. If your baby's skin isn't super sensitive, these would be great but if your little one has sensitive skin, skip these and go for the Swaddlers."
2,Thisd just is the key text of 20th century philosophy. Written in aphoristic style and heavily reactive to the conversation between Frege Russell and the early Wittgenstein that gave birth to contemporary analytic philosophy it is a must read (in company with some of the texts from those three authors). Nobody should remain unchanged in their thinking by reading and striving to understand this work.
1,"I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well."
1,"This book was very disappointing, by the title you would think that this book has useful information about the different religions and how homosexuality plays a part in that religion. I could only force myself to read half of this book before I got sick of the author constantly talking about homosexuality as humiliating and ridiculous. Having researched Native American tradition and Wicca I have come to know that neither of these traditions look down on homosexuality as being humiliation or ridiculous. This book is not at all what it appears to be."
1,Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.
1,"As anyone can clearly tell from the reviews, this bundle (which is three existing DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a sheet of paper bearing the ""cover"" image rubber cemented to the front -- not a space-saver) only contains the rated cuts of FEAST II and FEAST III. However, TWC has seen fit (finally) to fix this decision by quietly releasing a new DVD. The revised set comes in a single, regular-width DVD case, and all three discs are the Unrated versions. The UPC for that version is 883476028965, and it can be found at many Wal-Marts (right now anyway) for $10. If you want a space-saving, all-Unrated way to get the FEAST movies for cheap, track down that one and pass on this one."
2,Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman.
1,"Ordered a Halti training collar and received, on time, a Holt collar. Called seller, not respones. ""Returns require prior authorization code,"" but request was routed to a ""mailbox full"" number. No follow up from seller."
2,"His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?"
2,"Though ""The Big Picture"" was more of an atmospheric album to listen to and not a chartbuster, ""The Road To El Dorado"" Soundtrack is an exeptionally unique mix of songs I've never heard Elton create. The upbeat ""El Dorado"" is one of the best Elton songs in the last 5 years. Without judging Elton by his style of writing and earlier works, his songwriting is so different in this album that you wouldn't believe Elton could've possibly written it. This just proves the vastness of Elton's songwriting talents. Elton's voice is in fine form, and this CD is a must buy for not only Elton fans, but those who want to listen to an album that's both unique and creative."
2,"I read this book years ago when it was newly published. I passed it around from friend to friend until my copy disappeared. I consider it the best psychological thriller of all. Thanks,Amazon"
2,I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book.
1,"Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
1,"I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America"
2,"With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al. He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day. Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching. But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run."
1,"This movie is UNACCURATE! Stupid! Foolish! Laughable! Not like the games! How? Here's a list of what was bad about this so-called ""movie"":*The Goombas are tiny brown mushroom-like enemies not dinosaurs!*King Koopa is human!*The Mario Bros. do not live in Brooklyn in the games!!*Bowser (King Koopa) has a wife*In the games there IS no Dinosaurcity! It's the Mushroom Kingdom*Toad is not in this movie (dumb)*Yoshi was more cartoony and can talk in the games*More than HALF of the enemy characters are missing in this movieAND MANY MORE!But don't panic you'll get a good chuckle from the EXTREME bad acting! Seriously even Nintendo hated this movie!Overall: Is Super Mario Bros. bad? Of course not! It's not a bad game! It's just a bad movie. (...) If you want a splendid adventure then stick with the games."
2,"Released in '80 'Dream Stree Rose' was Gordon's fourteenth album. I happened to be dating seriously at the time of its release and thought this girl might be the one, so I put her to the test. I gave her a copy of this album along with one of his early releases; 'Back Here On Earth.' I told her ""You'd better learn to love this music if you want to keep dating me"" (stupid, but absolutely true).She loved it and we will be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary this coming August. Ahh... the power of a true poet. Thanks Gordon!'Dream Street Rose' contains -10 tracks- of solid Lightfoot compositions, my favorites are; 'Ghosts Of Cape Horn', 'Whisper My Name' and 'If You Need Me.'"
2,"I disagree with the other reviewer. I think the title describes this book beautifully, because the alcoholic adult in the story WAS ""just another kid"" and that's the way Hayden treated her. I found this a deeply moving book. It is easy to love and want to help small children, even difficult ones. It is harder to have the same kind of feelings for adults. That Hayden showed so well that adults are ""just other children"" was beautifully done, I thought."
2,"Let me say that I have the first album, and love that, and this is just as good. It's got the same attitude and is still heavy. It may have a few more slower songs, but they're just as good in their own way. If you liked the first one, you should like this one, and if you're a fan of hard rock, then you should like this."
2,"My Sister and I when we were little used to love to sing along with Books and Tapes in the Wee Sing Series, especially this one, because we have always loved to laugh. The Wee Sing books and tapes will take children into a world of fun, they can learn wonderful things from these tapes. However, it never has to seem like learning. That's part of the magic. For on these recorded tours, your childrens tourguides are singers and actors. If you have children be sure to buy this tape you'll laugh your head off with them. My sister and I eventually outgrew these tapes, but I kept them, even copied them onto blank audiotapes so I could give them as gifts to people who have children. Now if only Pam Beall and Susan Nipp could make a sequel to this one and call it Wee Sing More Silly Songs."
2,"If you are from the baby boomer generation, you can truly understand what made your parents, aunts, and uncles of this generation who they were. Since the events of September 11th and after reading this book, I have a finer appreciation of what heroes are truly made of. I have a better insight into who my parents were and why. I also understand why I am the way I am and what these qualities that were passed down, did for me in my life. It also makes you appreciate the cost of freedom and what the men and women of the military did and continue to do to protect our liberties. Something I think we took for granted before September 11th. Enlightening book."
2,"Florence King is one tough broad: a meat eating, heat packing, bisexual Republican who has NO patience for whiners, slackers,huggies, fuzzy wuzzies, or anyone even remotely PC. But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout. You go,girl!"
2,A number of reviewer have reported what HP's support site reports - that the LaserJet 1020 does not work on Windows Vista. Just use the original driver CD that comes with the printer and run the installation on Vista. The installer automatically detects the printer and installs the driver. This printer works perfectly with these drivers on Windows Vista Home Premium edition.
1,As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.
2,"I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =)."
1,Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit.
1,"The statue pictured is not what the recipient got! I wish that this company would show exactly what they are shipping, not what is pictured here. I will not order from this company again."
2,the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
2,"Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement."
1,"just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger.All this charger does is allow me to turn on the computer (sometimes), it does NOT charger my powerbook g4."
2,"Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes."
1,This company sucks. It's been a lil over a month and never received item. I never got response back from the company after I emailed the 4+ times. I'm also dissatisfied with Amazon and will never use them as well. All I've gotten is the run around. I want my money back so I can go on my way
1,"This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then."
1,"The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight."
1,I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
1,"Like so many others, hard to believe this ever made itthrough HP QA - I end up hand feeding many, failure over75% of the time!!! Find another machine."
1,"This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money."
1,"The premise of the movie is nothing new but the acting was horrible. The worst part being Simon's accent. I got so annoyed everytime he would open his mouth and say ""You didn't say Simon says""....The rest of the characters were rather flat...the cheating boyfriend, the best friend cheating with the boyfriend, the stoner and ect. Also, all the flying axes get a little old after the first few times. What I wanted to know was how he could set them all up so quickly...?? The final showdown was odd and cheesey. All things considered it was a very lame and boring movie."
1,"For a Finance Professor at NYU this book should be an embarrassment. It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."
2,"That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format."
1,"I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!"
2,"I saw this toy in Delhi but purchased in Australia. I found it to be a simple in operation and very intelligent. I found it captures the attention of not only children but adults as well. I would like to buy this toy in Shanghai,China and gift it to children known to me. Please tell me how to procure it in China and its cost."
2,I collect old hymnals and lived in Mennonite country for a few years. 606 is the Mennonite Doxology. It's an awesome arrangement that is sung so beautifully a capella by the Mennonites. So glad to have my own copy of this!
2,"Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy's two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. ""Turn This World Around"" is my favorite on the CD, but the rest of the material is also great."
1,"I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
2,"Although the quality of the DVD left a bit to be desired, the memories it brought back were fantastic. I had thought those old moments were never to be seen again, but viewing this DVD allowed me to relive them."
1,"Whatever. The only one demonstrating the slightest amount of talent is the singer, who used to be in O.L.D along with bass player Plotkin. They should have stuck to what they knew. The singing/shrieking is best described as excrutiating, but the music has no redeeming features. I've nothing against detuning but detuning this far just makes the guitar sound poorly tuned and badly played. To me it's extreme for extreme's sake, like making it sound plain crap was their primary objective. Mission accomplished, 2/10."
2,I thought that is book was very good. It was mostly about friendship between two friends name lennie and George. Lennie is the retarded one and George takes care of him. Cause lennie mom and dad die when he was a little boy. They both have a dream to own there own land. There dreams very come true because George shots lennie. If George didn't shot lennie then the police would kill him because he hurt a girl in the weeds. Weeds is the name of the town that they use to live. But they had to move because what lennie had done to the girl. Now they work on the ranch. Lennie can't talk that well but he is strong like a bull. George is the smart one he takes care of lennie. George gets mad lennie cause George buys lennie a puppy but lennie is so strong that when he pets the puppy they puppy dies. At the end of the book George shot lennie for lennie good. There dreams never came true.
1,"I wish I would have rented it before i bought it! Now I am out 20 dollars for a crapy movie. man it Sucked! It was slow, no plot, BORING! The most boring movie this year! It made me feel like I had ADD and didn't want to pay attention anymore, it was so bad, don't waist your money on this one! it makes no sense at all! the best part was the sceanery in the woods! I'd won't be surprised if people kill themselfs after watching this crap!"
2,"Although this CD has been out a while, I just purchased it. WoW!I was blown away. Johnny Zoot really rocks. I especially liked the note he sang on Cobwebs. The lyrics and feel makes me sad but that is a testament to the strong emotions which Jonathan Zoot summons from the bottom of his soul.This band would have been one of the tops in the 40's and should be today with the fine musicianship and bass/vocal prowess of J. Zoot.I have a small dentist practice in my town and have made my patients listen to this when they are tied in their chairs and they almost never complain.Thanks Zoot people."
1,"I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."
1,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
2,"This moisturizer does wonders. I have combination skin, oily and acne prone in some parts, dry in others. This moisturizes without causing breakouts or making me greasy. Also, at 26 yrs old, I believe in fighting wrinkles before they start. I met a 30-looking 40 yr old once and she said that Eucerin was her secret. Instantly got me hooked! And the 15 spf is the perfect amount that on vacation I'll still get a little tan without the sunburn or worry of aging my skin. Try this stuff out!"
1,"Many of the numbers are by ""members of the band"" and do not give the true sound of the original. Some of the vocals are truly bad. Save your money and buy the originals which are readily available at reasonable prices."
1,"The good news is that this coffee maker doubles as a humidifier. Steam shoots out of mine like a 19th century train locomotive. The lack of a proper seal between the filter basket lid and the water reservoir is the culprit.The filter basket and water reservoir are also not separate chambers. This causes steam to rise from the filter basket, hit the lid, and condense as water back into the reservoir. No doubts this is the main factor contributing to the very long brewing process."
1,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
1,i have both vol. one and two... love them! i ordered vol. three from copemania and that was in early march .. still getting the runaround! it is April 21st. and i am still waiting.....if i ever get it i know i will love it too!
2,this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
1,"Season One was so phenomenally good, I could not wait for Season 2! Needless to say, based on the title of my review, I found the stories to be WEAK....POORLY WRITTEN. The actors maintain their interesting persona's, but with poor support from poorly written, obviously hastily written, LACKLUSTER STORIES. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT COMPARED TO SEASON ONE! One wonders if the original writing staff was replaced, and a new group of writers had to come up with something over the weekend. Other readers my not agree with my assessment, and if not, I am glad they are happy with their purchase. I returned mine, as I, fortunately, found one of my DVD discs to have a pixel defect. Thank Goodness!I will check out the future Season Three by way of Netflix, rather than risk buying further trash. Season Three, please be more like Season One!"
1,"While I will readily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia's Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. The title character-a young, pregnant runaway searching for her baby's father-should have been one with whom you could sympathize. Instead, Trevor's love affair with language never quite manages to include his characters, leading to an unsatisfying reading experience. Couple the lack of emotion with a depressing ending, and you have a book best suited to gathering dust."
1,"Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."
2,"Sanctuary is the best and very imaginative in it story lines. I love Amanda Tapping and the whole cast, they are so talented. The bonus features were great too, I liked hearing what they had to say about an episode or anything else. I love Sanctuary, I can not wait for season 3.Big Fan,Christine Martin"
1,"Don't waste your time reading them...They tell you absolutely nothing. Each entry contradicts the other.Remember, humans write these things."
1,"In theory, magnetized blocks seem like a neat idea but in reality, these click bricks stink. They offer little flexibility in terms of the things you can build (in comparison to good old wooden blocks). The only way your can create something that will pass as a building is by looking at the pictures in the brochure. At best the completed buildings are really dumb looking. My 3-1/2 year old tried to make them work but was quickly frustrated. Don't waste your money."
2,"I purchased this for my son for his second birthday. It is great because he's very active and in a transitional stage with toys - too old for stuffed animals but too young conceptually for most toys with a recommended age of 3 and up. I have kept this for an indoor toy for the long winter months. Assembly was simple and at this point, I do not need to add the sand to the bottom to ""weigh it down"", but I might have to as he gets older and plays with the toy more aggressively. Most importantly, my son loves it - it keeps him happy, active and entertained. I hope your cherished little one will like it too."
2,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
2,"This game is great! I could not stop playing it even when it was time for bed. I snuck played it under my covers. Only one problem. It takes forever to get through the dwarf chamber. Other than that, it is a great game and I recomend it."
2,"I think that this is a great album. My personal favorite song on it is ""Like I Love You."" Probably the most popular song on it is ""Takes a little time."" My friend is crazy about that song! You should buy this CD!"
2,"I have purchased all the Perry Mason TV series, 1 through 6, through Amazon. I have not been disappointed with any of the series. Looking forward to season Seven."
1,Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.
2,"Looking at this collection really shows the diversity in Hokusai's long career. In one of the essays, the writter comments that Hokusai changes his style so much that his work looks like the work of a different artist. The breath of this volume helps the viewer see how creative and inventive this master is. What I like about Hokusai is that his personal life is just as interesting as his work. The essays included do a good job placing the differnent periods in context with the times and Hokusai's own massive body of work."
2,"I was reading some reviews and I had to agree with some negative opinions but only when it comes to ""runny"" poop. They do tend to leak when my baby has stomach problems but during regular days these diapers are really great. I was using swaddlers when she was little but they were much more expensive than baby dry so I gave baby dry a chance and they are ok. They don't leak even after all night ""sleep"" - they are very heavy in the morning but no leaks. Great diapers for a price. I would definetely recomend using them!"
1,"not Clay Aiken. I am so sick of all of these people saying Clay Aiken is the ""Real American Idol"". If I remember correctly, HE LOST. Did you hear that people? HE LOST to Ruben Studdard by over 100,000 votes. I personally like Clay, I think he is extremely talented, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy. However, this album is just horrible. It's slow, bland, and just boring. All the songs sound the same, and the lyrics to ""Invisible"" are just a bit disturbing. I hope on his next outing he will have better material, he deserves better than this stuff. If you want to hear American Idol at it's best, go pick up ""Free Yourself"" by Fantasia. She's the best idol of all of them."
1,"I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
2,"When I bought my husband a new dual tuner Tivo box for his birthday, I broke down and ordered the wireless adaptor with it. We had previously had a verrry long phone cord going though 2 rooms to hook the box up, which was unsightly and annoying. Now we have this teeny tiny adaptor that works great, is easy to install and adds so much to the already terrific Tivo experience! I moved our old box to my studio and HAVE to have an adaptor for it as well. Highly recommended and a must-have for all Tivo users!!! (It's a little less expensive here than at the Tivo website, but still a bit pricey. Is it worth the price? YES!!!"
2,"I had no idea what to expect going into this film (just watched it on DVD a few minutes ago). I had heard some negativity from fans of the comic (I've never read the comic myself); and it certainly had the potential to be a flop. But I absolutely loved it! The plot was interesting, the acting was good, the effects were great -- and there was not a boring moment. What could have been a hack, predictable plot was always surprising and interesting. Hats off to the writers and director -- with all the crap horror/thriller that gets on the big screen, this was a welcome change."
2,"I originally read these books in my early teens. It is an escapist guilty pleasure to revisit them in my 50's. Campy, but classic. I'd highly recommend for anyone who enjoys sci-fi/adventure tails."
2,"This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet."
1,"I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."
2,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight."
2,I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great. I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life.Too bad it's not possible to pickup/hangup without connecting a headset lifter (lame).
2,Bought this for my nephew for his birthday and he loves it. Lots of different things for him to do.
2,"I think too many people are assuming that they are buying a compilation CD when they pick up this release. In fact, this was the original album released in 1957. Ella gets top billing becuse she was the biggest of the three ""names"" at the time. These sessions were laid down between Jan 4, 1956 and April 30, 1957. Each artist gets a chance to showcase their talents and it is apparent that, when they all get together for the few numbers that they all share, they are really swinging and having a great time. Basie's band was in top form, the arrangements were wonderful and the vocals are spot on. This is a terrific window into the past."
1,Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere.
2,"I can't understand why people like (WTS)MG? better. DM's got everything. It's simply amazing.The best songs, IMO, are Rock 'n' Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, Cigarettes & Alcohol (so f***ing good) and Slide Away. They get 11 out of 10. The others 10 out of 10.If you're new to Oasis. Buy this album first. I promise that you won't be disappointed. Not if you appreciate good music."
1,"I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?"
2,"I have seen all the earlier Batman movies and I must say this is by far the greatest. The older ones were ok, but lacked that realistic feel. In Batman Begins I felt moved by it, it was realistic, it was dramatic, and it felt real. This movie is a must buy for any action/adventure lover."
2,"I've been studying music in the classical realm for a long time, but have always been interested in electronic music in both performance and composition. Of all the electronic I've heard from Kraftwerk to Daft Punk, I must say this is perhaps the best I have ever heard. This two-disc set is nothing less than magnificent. The formal structure and sheer smoothness of the sounds from minute 1 to 95 is how music SHOULD be heard in the preset day. I have played every Beethoven Sonata, the complete Etudes of Chopin, Islamey, Gaspard de la Nuit, on and on... As an experienced pianist and professional classical musician, I think I can safely say that these master composers would have GLADLY accepted Hawtin into their inner circle, if not for the plethora of distinct, yet related sounds, then for the complexity of the underlying formal structure that holds the entire soundscape together. This is a modern master-work. Don't miss the chance to experience it..."
1,"Very stupid adaptation of the DC horror comic book not only lacks brains but also a lacks an actor who can pull off the complex role of John Constantine. Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie."
1,"First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash...."
2,"I bought a similar Inga Moore version of this book for my son and we love it. The text has been ""sensitively abridged"" to make it appropriate for young children and the result is a delightful story that brings small animals to vivid life. Inga Moore's illustrations are what drew me to this book. They are wonderfully detailed and evocative of the beauty of the Thames Valley."
2,"This is one badass movie. The cgi is spectacular. The 3d is not that great, but the action is crazy, it never stops. Cant wait for Transformers 4. Keep up the great work!"
2,"I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to ""bog-down"" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite."
2,"This is pretty much the greatest comic book adaption ever made!Batman Begins is an epic!The story is so great!The acting is top-notch!This is as close to the comic book as you can get.Christopher Nolan did a excellent job at actually capturing the myth and personality of Batman on film.Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly,truly like no other before him.All the actors play their parts extremely well,as if they were born for the roles!Batman Begins is an instant classic film,that no doubt will be talked about and remembered for years to come.If you havent bought this movie already,I advise that you add it to your collection!It is truly a must have!"
2,"Wilmington Chester Mass Choir is incredible. I highly recommend this inspirational gospel choir CD. I especially love the song ""Holy, Holy, Holy"", it alone is worth the price of the CD. You can realyy ""feel"" the Lord when you hear thier music, and you know they mean every word and note of it. Thank you Amazon.com for featuring this CD, I had a hard time finding it anywhere else."
1,"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."
1,"Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron."
1,"This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight."
1,"I had to get this book for my advanced calculus class. There are 3 issues I have with this book. First, that the material in any given chapter gives what is needed to work most, BUT NOT ALL, of the problems at the end of the given chapter. Second, having solutions to selected exercises is a good tool to have, and if an instructor disagrees, he or she can just assign problems that don't have solutions given. Not all students would use those solutions, but it's nice to have to verify one is on the right track. Third, the author does not explain things as clearly as other authors do. He (assuming Edward is male) could have explained things much better without adding a single word to the text. I find myself frequently referring to 'How To Prove It' by Velleman, since Velleman explains things much better. In short, this book is not the worst I've seen, and I would give this book 3 stars, were it not for the price."
1,This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.
2,"In this day and age when Truth is questioned, the source/author of a book is important indeed. If one believes that God alone is Truth, then one can read with confidence, The Supremacists. The author, P. Schlafly, is on God's Wavelength.The Left have sought for more than 50 years to control our nation. They cannot do it by the ballot box so the revolution is therein by judges, as we have seen in the past decades but even more so in the past years (Mass), judges making rules/laws whereas they were meant only to INTERPRET the laws.Their revolutionary rulings have and will continue to cause a great divide in the Culture War, which will define us as a nation that will live forever, or go down the sad pages of history as so many nations before us have gone, e.g., Ur. of the Chaldees, Babylonia, Persia, Alexandria, Egypt, Rome, mighty Rome, she merely disintegrated from within.History is making its torrential mark on the world, and let us not be asleep while it rages."
1,"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
1,"It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard."
1,"... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood."
1,"i was really dissapointed when i bought this album. The first time i heard bones was live when i was 15 at the ""Wave"" in Staten island the kid sent me into a trance. He is the master of beats and welcomed me to the scene.I havent stopped dancing yet.To expierance bones dont purchase this album see him live at his best or check out technolo-g or houseloop.Frankie bones is known for the boom boom and he will without a doublt ,keep you thumpin!!!"
1,"I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless."
1,"Worked ok on the piping i pre-assembled before getting under the house - slow but it workedThe heads like to slide and move around, which may be why heating is so uneven.Noticed that it took 60 - 120 seconds before the pipe would be hot enough.Several times it failed to heat the pipe enough to melt the solder once under the house.Waited 4 minutes before my arm fell asleep. The unit was noticeably cooler than it had been earlier in the day.Ended up with the torch by the end of the day.Great concept but cannot recommend this unit. Cost was about $10 per solder joint."
2,"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
2,This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great.
1,"I put this cd on and my dog started howling. As if there was a full moon. This CD is horrible. American Idol is stupid. If any of these clowns had an iota of talent, they would have signed to a label already ( See Kelly and Justin movie- that movie made about half a million at the box office!). I looked at the notes on the CD. He didnt write one song? So basically someone picked all of these songs for him. This CD makes me wretch. Also, dude is kinda ugly for a teen idol. In fact all of the winners and runner up are horrible looking. WTF?"
2,I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!
2,Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!
1,"I guess maybe it said they have the right to change the cover, but the one we received was completely different! Looked like an old Harlequin romance novel.... also the book had people reviewing it along with the text and my daughter didnt like that format."
2,"The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum"
1,"Boring, boring, boring. My g/f (a Nirvana fan) and I watched this film together on a Sunday afternoon. Please save your time and money, do not watch this film."
1,"The first one we received was dead out of the box. It made a loud grinding and sounded like a fan hitting metal. We assumed this was due to shipping damage and received a replacement. The replacement worked fine for six months but suddenly the display panel would go blank and the clock would reset after a few minutes. The microwave has now ceased functioning altogether. The warranty states ""in-home"" service, but there are no local service facilities."
1,"This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children. After over 3 decades, it would be so sad to see Gammell's version just disappear..."
2,"Wow, where to begin? I bought this cd in 1992 after one of my city's alternative rock stations started giving significant airplay to ""We Are Each Other"" and ""36-D."" Never could I have imagined how 90% of the songs on this album are outstanding! From the sad stories of ""Old Red Eyes"" and ""The Rocking Chair,"" to the upbeat ""We Are Each Other,"" ""The Domino Man,"" and ""I'm Your #1 Fan,"" and to the spooky, somewhat bizarre stories told in ""Here It Is Again,"" and ""Something That You Said."" It's a shame this recording didn't get the same kind of airplay in the states as it did in England, where they are a smash. This cd had been given to friends around the country, from Ohio to Florida and Texas, and everyone has loved it! Enjoy"
1,"This movie is bad, Bad, BAD! Makes Rudy Ray Moore look like Fellini!Essentially, this is the crude ""story"" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Problem is: outrageously bad acting, corny ""humor,"" strong and unecessary reverse racism (the lone geeky White character is constantly referred to as a ""cracker,"") vile sexism, unappealing characters. etc. etc.Get this video only if your fireplace runs low this winter."
2,"This mini-series was jaw-dropping from beginning to end! If you like ""24"", you'll LOVE this..and I think it's better!"
2,"Firstly, Escaflowne is a great classic anime, and one of my personal favorites. The visuals are a bit dated (1995), but what made the show was the plot, the world, and the audio!2nd, All of the Escaflowne CDs are incredible. Especially lovers only (a 'best of' for the series), and the movie soundtrack. This is all due to the work of Yoko Kanno (Cowboy bebop, darker than black, Macross, RahXephon, among other greats).

1,"Just purchased this little gem and went to insert the cassette. The instructions say ""The cassette compartment will automatically lift up and open when opening the lid."" It Doesn't. For $1,359, I'm back to Circuit City for a new one. If I have problems once more . . . then I'll try another brand."
1,"This card was big disappointment. I am using it on a dual Athlon MP system with Windows XP Pro. I have had repeated problems with the card causing my system to spontaneouesly reboot. Trying to play live video on a media player such as Windows Media Player or RealPlayer seems to be a particular problem. Applying repeated driver updates from ATI has not helped. The card is very fast, but the system stability issues are driving me crazy and have caused me to remove it from my computer. With a different card my system works great. I have have had good experiences with other ATI cards, but this card (or its drivers) are unstable."
1,I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
2,"This movie has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. I do, however, warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch, and the language even made me want to leave the room, but if your okay with that, the movie is very action-packed."
1,"Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
2,"All right, I do admit a like for the first four, but this one knocks them all out of the running. This is how Batman was meant to be seen. It is the closest thing to the dark cartoon series, and the comics, I have seen. The size is giagantic, and makes you feel surrounded as you watch. Christian Bale is perfect for this role, he has an underlying tension, that makes all of his characters verge on psychotic, and a few actually were, but for Batman, it was perfect. The ability to get so many well known names to come across as these characters believably is wonderful, and makes you care about all aspects of Gotham City. As long as Chris (Nolan) stays on this same wave length with the rest, Batman will never die."
1,"I signed up for these with the subscription purchase because they were slightly cheaper than the Huggies. We are not happy with them at all. They don't seem to hold as much, which is a problem for overnight. You also have to be careful how you position them on your child so they don't leak. When I used swaddlers for my son as an infant, I thought this was a great brand, but the Baby Dry are definitely NOT of the same quality. We will continute to use these during the day until they are gone, but I will not by them again."
2,"What an excellent story with a villain who is anything but a flat character. Thanos has a lust for power, but he finds out that it's perks come with a price. Below death's affections now above them, Thanos revels in his own might. With power comes pride, and it is his downfall. But is losing ultimate power and ultimate responsibility really such a bad thing?"
2,Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
1,"In general, I like the product specs, but getting it home and using it is a different story. The auto-off feature makes it useless.I used it as a second amplifier for streaming music. The sound quality is nice, but it clicks off when the volume drops low. This means you often miss the beginning and ends of songs (most songs have points of low volume) and in some cases, bits of the middle. I was so embarrassed when I had people over and the music kept switching off and on, making loud clicks in the process.This first issue is a show stopper for me and caused me to buy a different receiver (Teac AG-790A). However it also has a second flaw: no bass or treble controls. This makes it tough when you are playing from a single source to two different sets of speakers. There's no way to separately change the tone for speakers connected to this receiver.Overall, its inexpensive, but not worth the money."
2,This book is amazing! I ordered this book from barns and Nobel on line then 2 days later they sent an e-mail telling me it did not go through. So A friend told me to go to amazon! I will only go to amazon now it was so simple a Kid could do it! I LOVE AMAZON!
1,"After a tremendous amount of research, I was able to get to the bottom of the issue w/the HD version of Atlas/Aust. Revealed. I have confirmed that a firmware update is available from Toshiba players that will resolve the playback issues. A Microsoft update is currently not available but will be soon."
2,Pampers are our sole brand in this house. They fit the best and they hold the best. That's all the really matters to me.
1,After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!
1,"I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resvskan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
1,"Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this."
1,"I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."
1,It's not even a book. It's a photo copied ringed binder. I was surprised that Amazon marketed this as a ligitimate book published by a real publisher. It is an absolute joke.
2,"On the peaks of the High Siera, Kerouac's narrator, Japhy Ryder explores the inner nuances of one's thought processes and being, away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay area's consternative environs. Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it. A great read showing the inner exploration and sanctity with which Kerouac grounded his Bohemian lifestyle."
2,"Since I suffer from this problem, I was very interested in the subject. Mr. Proctor was a detective with the Orange County Police and has experience in this area. I was more interested in how to obtain evidence that will hold up in court. The book was lacking in that dept., and instead said go to your local police dept. to start. Mr proctor actually emailed me with this information. I was trying to go with a private investigator and he didn't think that was a good idea. I give this book a thumbs up."
2,"No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex! One hillarious film."
2,"I was literally pumping only 2 to 5cc (32cc make an ounce) for my newborn who was almost 5 days old when my lactation consultant told me to try this. Within days I noticed I was consistently pumping an ounce then gradually more, by day 10 I was barely supplmenting with formula. This stuff is like a miracle worker. Be sure to not drink anything before and after wards for at least 20 minutes. This makes the product more effect.Yes it taste pretty bad but order the alchol free and no problems. It's so worth it, it's for your baby. They deserve the best and our breastmilk is what's best for them."
2,"When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it....all I can say is that its tight. You gotta check out joints like ""Imagine That"", ""Take It Off"" and ""Fuhgidabowdit"". Other ill joints are ""Farmers"" and ""Hello"" what the heck every song is fresh. This is way better than his previous joint ""Phenomenon"". Get this one, it sure is butta...its great to see the one of tha greatest back in tha game!!!!"
2,"If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
1,"I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!"
1,"Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page. That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from."
1,"This is one of those books that I like the *idea* of, but not so much the execution. It's gotten to the point where if a book has the word ""spooky"" (or a variation) on the cover, I'm just going to assume it's not. The idea - offering ideas for six themed parties - would make for an excellent book if they were all actually Halloween-themed. Sadly, even the Halloween-specific party suggestions fall a little flat."
2,"When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
2,"I have converted to Judaism in order to have a single faith marriage. Though this books additudes were a bit outdated towards interfaith relationships and does not recognize the wide spread intermarriage phenomenom, the author has a good handle on the issues affecting the Jewish identity. It is a very conservative approach to raising your child with a Jewish Identity, with a focus on early religious/cultural training."
1,"Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."
1,"If you are a very senior Senior, be careful of the pop-up enticements you do not understand. There is no way I can ever view the movie I have been wanting to see for a very long time. I now know that I have DVD and not Blu-Ray, whatever that is. Reaching anyone to question is a near impossibility in this sales-mad world. The saddest thing is that I have not found anyone in my area to whom I can just give this movie in exchange for an opportunity to view it. Disappointed Old Lady"
2,"An excellent scholarly book. Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader."
2,Awsome Book highly recomended for those intrested in reasing fine literature however those weak of heart it truly is a sad story and shows the cruelty of humanity for those in George's positon however I truly recomend the book for anyone
2,"Cream/ Fresh Cream (DCC Gold Disk - 13 tracks): Fresh Cream is a great album. The original U.S. release, however, did not include the song ""Spoonful"", so my advice is to find a version of the album that at least includes that great song. The Gold disk has the 10 cuts from the U.S. release plus ""Spoonful"", ""Wrapping Paper"", and ""The Coffee Song"". As the Gold disk has become SO expensive recently, I would advise a different version of the CD but, as said before, make sure you get one with ""Spoonful"" (in truth, `Wrapping Paper"" and ""The Coffee Song"" are not that necessary to own)."
2,"Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a book of this nature on hand, literally."
1,"This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping."
1,"I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
2,"This CD has a lot to know. If you take your time you usually learn pretty well. I myself am only on the first CD. I am learning the words before the symbols (personally, I think that works the best). Overall, it's good. But I need to spend a lot of time on it. The second CD has just Japanese, so if I were you I'd spend a lot of time and get the required 1800 points."
1,"I was really hoping that this book would have up-to-date tips on saving money. A few pages into the book, I realized that rarely did the suggestions apply to today's world. I was only able to read just a few pages. Disappointing."
2,"Amazon has the best prices on diapers. Join Amazon Moms and get 15% off, then join the subscribe and save for another 15% off and then lookout for 20% off coupons in parenting magazine. Where can you get 50% off of diapers? It's so easy to order and I get them the next day to my doorstep. How can you beat that?"
1,"This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful."
2,"I highly recommend this book and would have given it five stars except for the fact that there was a small typo or two in it--not the fault of the authors, who are all excellent writers.Although the book states it's for LDS writers who want to break into the LDS market, the advice given applies to national market publishing in many cases.I purchased this book at the beginning of my writing career, when I knew nothing about how to get my work published, and learned extensively from it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in having his or her work published. The information runs the gamut from how to write query letters to handling rejections. Thanks in part to ""Publising Secrets,"" my co-author, Nichole Giles, and I now have a book of LDS humor that will be released in the fall of 2009. [....]"
1,"John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
2,"This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair."
2,"This recording is proof that God exists. Like seeing Michaelangelo's David, climbing the red rocks of Sedona or listening to the giggles of a four-month-old, hearing this disc leaves one with a sense of well-being and light, knowing that the Universe is not just a random play of molecules after all, but a deliberate dance of infinite possibilities and joy.Coltrane pushed and pushed himself his entire life, but here he just pushed his ego aside and let it flow.These are not merely musical notes. They are echoes of the primordial Om, a prime example of Man's capacity for perfection. Truly A Love Supreme.I guess you could say that I dig this album."
2,"I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books...."
2,from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
1,I love Vanity Fair Full Slips but this one was just to small for me. I will be looking for a larger size.
1,"I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!"
1,"I had to buy this book for a class. It is the most BORING book ever. If you don't have to buy this, please save yourself the misery of having to read it and don't!"
2,"I also discovered the Uluru CD during my first trip to Australia. Although I now have several of O'Connor's CDs this remains my favorite. His music as composed for specific locations (Marnier is also a 5 star in my book) truly captures the soul of the locations for which they are composed. For me they invite an instant trip back in time to a treasured visit. In Uluru, others will find he captured the very essence of the Red Center; though some may simply enjoy the peaceful elegance of the music."
1,"Save your money or purchase a hammer when you buy this cd because all you'll want to do is hit yourself in the head for buying it in the first place. If not for that then you'll be hitting yourself just so you don't have to hear this woman's whinney voice, trust me. I bought this album just a few days ago and all I can say is..Well, you get the point.."
1,"So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library."
2,"This is a great series for any Christian who would like to know more about the church. Schaff is an amazing writer giving us a theological and philosophical look at sound church history. This book will give the engaged reader sound and intelligent insight not only to know church hisory, but more importantly, a sense of its meaning and beauty."
2,"This CD is stunning. I am a cellist, and I originally bought it for some of the Bach pieces that featured prominent instrumental parts, but from the start, I was spellbound. The first selection, BWV 82A, is one of the most beautiful works of Bach that I have ever heard. Ian Bostridge's voice is spellbinding. I am looking forward to hearing much more, especially his lieder CDs."
1,"I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""
1,"""The Cherry Orchard"" is an atrocious play. If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend."
2,This book is awesome! Dali is no doubt one of the greatest artists of the 20th century! Smoked some bud too no doubt!! hehe
1,"The first chapter is: ""God Made Me"". If you are of the eminently rational and obviously authentic mindset that Superman doesn't exist and did not save Gotham City from certain destruction, don't expose your kids to this nonsense. The cultists can't resist an opportunity to brainwash the innocent. This ""free"" e-book is like a Trojan horse. Take a look inside before you allow it to poison your Android device.And, if you are a cultist, please get this book. It may be of genuine assistance in brainwashing your naive and innocent children into your particular cult. Just tell them: Superman made me. Then tell them that Superman, the Easter Bunny, Allah, Jebus and the Flying Spaghetti Monster and all related fictitious supernatural entities are REAL, and DEMAND belief or you'll end up boiling in a hot pan of frying oil for all eternity. Along with some leeks, large butterfly shrimp, and potentially crushed garlic.Have I made my point yet?Don't brainwash your kids."
1,"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."
2,"These are the best at cleaning between teeth other than floss. I never leavehome without em. They are good, good, good."
1,Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included
1,"I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also."
1,"I agree with all the positive reviews regarding the quality of the rice, but I have to give this rice cooker 2 stars on the basis of its poor quality of construction. We've had this cooker for 5 months. The removable inner lid was recently dropped from a height of < 4feet. This short drop resulted in one of the tabs breaking off the inner lid. Since it was so new, I figured it would be under warranty, but Zojirushi said this wasn't covered and I had to pay for a new part ($15 with slow shipping, 10 days). I expected either better construction or better warranty coverage from a $155 rice cooker. (Now, effectively a $170 rice cooker for me) :("
1,"Not sure exactly what went wrong here - but this version of the book is RIDDLED with laughable typos. Horrible punctuation, missing words, random periods thrown in everywhere. ""ERIC"" becomes ""ERIE"" throughout. What the hell? Was this reprinted by monkeys?DONT BUY THIS VERSION."
2,"This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."
2,"I bought this Converse sneaker in black. These All Star sneakers look stylish and good with any casual pants I own. I would have given the product 5 stars, EXCEPT, these shoes are like walking on bricks since they have no cushion in the soles for the heels. I understand they're supposed to have the whole classic appeal... but if you're over 30 years old and try to rock a pair of Converse for an entire day, you may encounter some uncomfortable lower back pain. So 4 stars for fashion."
2,I loved that I could send all these diapers to a friend across the country for such a great price. And pampers diapers are my favorite.
2,"If you're reading this then you're probably skimming the reviews of this book in order to figure out if you should buy this book. The answer is yes. From what I, as a beginner, can tell, this book seems to be exactly what the other reviewers are calling it, _the_ traders bible.As with any bible, if you are going to take short term trading seriously, (which you most certainly should), this book should not only be read, but carefully studied, and it's teachings analyzed and followed."
2,"I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
1,"There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair."
1,"Jennifer Love Hewit is realy just a fad so her trying play a legend is just seems realy silly. For while I actually liked JLH well maybey not like but I could stand her after seeing this movie i lost all resepct for her. I don't think any one could play her, though I think Winona Ryder in some ways reminds me of her though doubt she'd do a TV movie. Jennifer Love Hewit maybe admires Audrey Hepburn but I still think doing this movey was bad idea. She could of helped UNACEF that's what Audrey Hepburn probaly would want to be remebered for. They didn't mention that at all (okay five second of UNACEF) they only showed two films she made and Audrey Hepburned made 27. I fond this flim very insulting to Audrey Hepburn fans."
1,"THIS FILM IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE IN THE WAY THAT IT CANCELS OUT THE ORIGINAL BATMAN MOVIE AND BATMAN RETURNS. TURNS OUT JACK NAPPIER DIDNT KILL BRUCE WAYNE'S PARENTS, IT WAS SOME OTHER BLOKE. THAT IS THE MAIN THING THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS FILM. ALSO AT THE END THE JOKER SEEMS TO BE HANDIN OUT CARDS. DONT THINK SO. NAPPIER FELL INTO A BOWL OF ACID AND TURNED INTO THE JOKER. HE ISNT THE SORT OF GUY TO GO THROWIN JOKER CARDS ABOUT. VERY STUPID. BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS ARE THE BEST BATMAN FILMS MADE. KEATON MUST BE OUTRAGED CUS I WOULD BE IF I WAS HIM!"
2,"This disc is simply gorgeous! I love classic movie scores, and this is one of my favorite collections. The ""Gunga Din"" and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" themes are so well done you can imagine each scene from the movie as it is played. These are my two favorite scores in the collection because the various themes are each given their own track. (And I already had the other scores on another compilation!) It really is a must for classic movie lovers!!!!!"
2,"I went to a sneak preview of this movie when itcame out last July and I loved it! I read the book before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the book and the movie are not really that similiar. I loved this movie because I love haunting movies, scary stuff that makes the audience scream. This one does it, though at the end it is a little far fetched I have to admit, but overall I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting leaves something to be desired on many occasions, however, but a movie like this you don't go to see because of the acting. Four Out Of Five."
2,"I always loved Wu and Ghost, so i had to check this out, not knowing what to expect, cause Wallets was just aight. I was def impressed by this album. I saw the single with Missy and I thought Ghost went pop, but after hearin the whole thing, all can agree, this is HOT. Check out ""Metal Lungies"" and ""Run"" for some hot D-Block verses from Jada, Sheek, and SP. ""Holla"" is just Toney rhymin over an old Delfonics song, not sample, the whole song! I hear this song on the Muzak workin at Price Chopper, make me crack up. Hottest track on this album tho, for me at least, ""Be This Way"". Good sample, hot hot beats, some REAL lyrics from Ghost, good message. Like he says on the intro, new label, same Starks......and a HOT album."
1,I bought this for my 6 year old son and it is very unstable. It falls apart way to easily. We have to lean it up against the wall so he can play with it and it still falls down.
1,"Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."
2,"I admit that I haven't finished the game yet but I've been enjoying playing it the last couple of days.Basically you command legions of the Romans. Archers, legionares, horsemen etc. On a terrain you have to beat the enemy.The units all have their special abilities, it's best to have spearman at the front to stop the enemy, horsemen to do quick attacks and archers for long range attack. Because of differences in heights it is important to have archers on higher positions.This all makes for fun. The graphis are really not great but I think most strategy-games players like me are not really interested in that. The sounds are fun and it has good historical accuracy with the names of all the tribes and their leaders.Worth the low price"
1,"I totally agreed with the review of ""Summer Bore!"" and I really almost couldn't finish the book. I think that she had a lot of knowledge and did a lot of research to write this book, but the plot is really slow. There are too much coincidents and some plots just don't connect. What makes it even worse is that the auther tried to connect what seemed so far-fetched plots. After we learned about some cult culture and main characters, the author had to use one sentence as a whole paragraph to explain how the story fitted into her research. At the end of the book, we just got all the expaination of the whole plots and how every character fits in the whole story. I hated this kind of spoon-fed story. I also don't care much about Dr. Tempe Brenna. Too bad for me. I had spent a lot of hours, after putting my two toddlers to sleep, to read a very disappointed book.No comparison to Patricia Cornwell's books."
2,"The seller of this item ships for free and they are quite fast getting them out the door. I was worried about installation and the column seemed slightly flimsy at first, but assembly was a snap in spite of not reading the directions very careful, and it seems quite sturdy once assembled.The accuracy itself seems to be great. Like all balances, the accuracy is phenomenal. No stepping on and off and getting wildly different results like with most scales I have had.Definitely worth the price if you are serious about watching your weight."
1,THE worst adiuo and bad story line. What'a waste of my hard worth cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."
2,"I realize that not every child is the same. Some may have allergic reactions to some brands or some brands may hold in leaks better. I have three children aging from 2 months to 4 years and they all use Pampers. We have tried other store brands and name brands, but they either leaked, caused a rash or just fell apart after use and wouldn't stay on. Pampers seems to stay on well, even on my active children who jump and roll off of everything and run all over. My four year old only wears diapers at night (as does my 2 year old recently) and they hold whatever both of them can throw at 'em, and some mornings, its completely full. But no leaks! Great diapers and the larger pack is the best for the money. I would recommend them anytime over any brand."
2,"Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single. I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I wouldn't guess that they've been trying to make a cd for 6 years, guys. They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out. So I would say that's a bit unfair to make that claim. Anyways I'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they've put out (except the What Evil Lurks E.P) and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single."
2,"I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!"
2,"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."
1,"The Audio CD is ""abridged"". What a joke! It is only a bit over 3 hours of audio on 3 cd's. It appears the author talks about Chi Running rather than reading from the book.If you have the ability to read and are interested in the book, buy the book instead.Listening to this is like listening the the author give a speech about chi running or an informative podcast about Chi Running. It's interesting and informative, but it isn't listening to the book as written. In fact, I can't believe this counts as an audio ""book""."
1,i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve
1,"There was no reason to make another movie in this series, but I guess there were still some action figures to be sold so here it is. In PG-13, no less! Boy, where to start. Well after 5 or 6 years, the evil OCP is still trying to tame Detroit and build a bigger badder cop. Now the Japanese have taken over OCP and have a Robo of their own and they are twin/triplets? For the most part this 3rd feature is just as bad as the 2nd one, but at least we see some of the townsfolk putting up some resistance. I'm also giving a little credit for some then new acting faces that are more recognized today. Although Peter Weller wisely didn't come back in the role of Murphy watch for Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Mako, Stephen Root, Bradley Whitford and Jill Hennessy."
1,"I guess I downloaded this book by mistake. I got to chapter 6 and that's as far as I could take the unbelievable story. I could see nothing funny and I have a great sence of humor. I gave it a 1 star because there is nothing lower. Sorry, wish I could return the book, but it's been too long, just got around to reading it."
2,"All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need."
2,"Well, when you hear of an Adam Sandler movie, a natural reaction is that you think that the movie is a hilarious comedy, but in this case, that's not entirely true. Don't get me wrong, the movie is FUNNY, persay, but I don't think I would catagorize it as a true comedy.If you're looking for an Adam Sandler type comedy, I'd rather recommend There's Something About Mary, which is a comedy with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz, than this movie.But don't get me wrong, this is a good MOVIE, but not a good comedy. Rob Schnieder's role is just plain dumb, but Drew Barrymore is what truly makes the movie worthy of watching. She did an excellent job. You have to be a die-hard Adam Sandler fan for you to appreciate his performance in this movie. If you are watching this movie for Adam Sandler, then this is a pure waste of your time, but if you're watching this movie for Drew Barrymore, it's well worth it!"
2,"This is an excellent diaper until my baby reaches 12 lb. After that, it leaks at night because it gets saturated. I wish Pampers makes a size 2 instead of a size 1-2. Size 3 looks so hugh so my baby is now using Swaddler size 2 instead."
2,"this movie is good not great because it follow the comics but not batman personalty micheal keaton got it right as far batman make up don,t get me wrong bale did a good actor but he got batman wrong i read the comics the batman keaton got right blade was better than this movie because wesley carries the darkness of blade bale don,t carry that well two because bale did he better val and geoge than two his verison it,s just as good as the frist batman movie not better than keaton this is better than superman returns for one the joker didn,t kill his pranets mr,s fox is in it ."
2,"This is one of the best musicals of our day. I do have to admit that Gene Kelly's voice by far overpowers all other Tommys that I've heard. However, I believe this guy truly comes in a close 2nd. The voices are truly delightful and make you feel as if you're right there. I do have to admit i'd just buy this cd for this rendision of ""Waiting for my dearie"""
2,Good Halloween show. We like it because I saw the original on tv. My daughter is sixteen and she liked it too
2,Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.
1,faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
1,I have purchased this perfume for years at Macy's. The perfume sent to me had the packaging and it appeared to be Dazzling Silver; however either the bottle was refilled with something that would make you ill or it was 40 years old. The vendor did not respond to my complaints or agree to refund my money. I would never order from these people again.
2,"I received my new wires just in time for the weekend and the new family Toyota Tacoma got some new wires. It took quite a bit of work to remove the throttle body intake tube, in order to get to the front plug wires on the passenger side but it was worth it. The wires fit perfectly. I recommend you clean the throttle body while you have the intake tube off. Having the TB up high makes it easier to clean the butterfly with a sturdy toothbrush."
1,"The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book ."
1,"I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Wow was it ever worse than I thought it could be! Full of ""clever"" one-liners, bad characters (both humans and robots... really? There's an old British autobot named ""Q"" who designs fancy gadgets and weapons?), and action that was at times fun, but for the most part incredibly drawn out and ultimately just boring. Basically this was 2.5 hours (and it feels like 4) of unpleasantly spent time."
2,I liked it. The message was good and there is plenty of relating points. I think they did a good job of blending humor with realistic life experiences. The cast does a good job holding my attention throughout the movie. Worth the watch if you like Sundance type films.
1,"I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
1,"This group bills it's self as the original Key West the Band so I tried it out because I like that group.No contest!If I were Key West the Band I would sue for misrepresentation!I tried listening to this music but it was tough to make it all the way thru.Bad, clique lyrics and songs.The singer is good but can't make up for the horrible songs and grainy recording techniques.Maybe next time -- but I doubt it."
1,"Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two ""bland"" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.I thought it was about time someone mentions these points."
1,It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older.
2,"This book was hilarious, and the concept was so true. I could see my friends in some of the characters.It seems that Shaw just couldn't resist showing us how crazy the human condition really is by his works that always include funny yet absolutely true twists on things, and his twist on the Don Juan tale is one of his best ones yet.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant."
1,I have never read such a terrible book in my life. Let me refer you to the excelent book by Henri Gamanche THE MASTER BOOK OF CANDLE BURNING. It is a far superior text containing much more relaiable material.
1,"Way too heavy to carry when full, Water doesn't shoot very far and you have to pump it."
2,"Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film. It is a fast paced heart pounder which leaves you lterally breathless afterwards. The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully. The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well. The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed. this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999. Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries. i hope to see more great exports soon!"
2,"So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach ""pooch"". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"
2,"very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared ""comedian"" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. it was painful. this made me glad that i didn't attend a childbirth class (and bought this instead).i also could have done without the Viacord plug... it's like a commercial took over the ending of the program to spoil it.all things considered, definitely worth watching."
1,"This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax."
1,"This book was, according to various sources, written in 1999, so it is hardly intruding on Brown territory esp in regard to the book Angels and Demons, which also deals with the election of a Pope. Compared to the Brown books its lowkey version of events makes it actually rather effective. Unfortunately it ends up making the same mistake as the Brown book, its villains turn out more worthy of sympathy than its heroes. In particular the Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, who Barry is determined to paint as such a scoundrel, won my admiration far more than the unhappy Colin Mitchner and his colorless girlfriend. Both the Father and the Cardinal are contesting over the content of the lost Third Secret of Fatima, which in this reviewer's opinion might as well have stayed lost. The book's a good airport read, but there's little of serious import about it."
1,"As a child we lived in the Yakima Valley. Some summer afternoons my father would take me with him to buy vegetables from a Japanese farmer. My father, normally outgoing, was reserved and deferrential. Dad explained that the farmer before the war had been a successful engineer, but had lost everything when he was forced to go to ""the camp"" - a tragedy and great waste. I've been haunted by that guiet farmer ever since, so it was with enthusiasm that I began Stubborn Twig, the story of a Japanese family's American experience.Stubborn Twig is well researched and chock full of details about the Yasui family. Reading their story should be compelling. It's not. It's repetitious, tedious and a slow, difficult read. The last 50 pages, the third generation, is a mix of biography and sociologist psycho babble. So why read Stubborn Twig? Because it's an important story, an American story that has much to teach us, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."
2,"When I received the bike, the packing board was broken.The bike quality is good."
2,The new System of a down cd is great carring over the same lyrical style of the first album but the music is much harder and packs an even more powerful punch. The musical work and devolpoed lyrics make this cd a definate best release of the year. Make sure to buy the limeted edition with the bonusd footage. All in all a great cd and definatly worth the buy.
1,"I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket."
2,This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
2,"Funny, smart, erudite, Steve Chandler affirms that our biggest and most powerful erogenous zone is our brain. Chandler deflates the myth that love just happens---true love, whether of a friend or a spouse or a pet, is cultivated and created, over and over again. Great stuff."
1,"The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
2,We bought this for our son for Christmas and my husband and I play with it every night after he goes to bed. We hooked after our very first try when it guessed - guinea pig!!!!
1,"the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all."
1,"I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words ""huh,"" ""what,"" and ""yeah"" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what ""so-called"" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it."
2,Great little knot guide! Good illustrations and directions are included. Nice small pocket size or put it in your workshop...
2,"This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book."
2,this is a must have book for people who are attracted to the moon energyI find the moon spells in this book make magic look easy
2,Very nice book! I am very happy with all the information on this book. It explains a lot of english grammar!
1,Pampers that I bought online are very poor quality than that are purchased from stores.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 4 192 Count-Jhansi
2,"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better."
2,"I'm pleased with the printing, coping, and photo reproduction that HP has produced with this gem of a printer. I'm completely satisfied."
2,"Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger. Its about $40 cheaper than the apple proprietary version and does the same exact thing -> power my laptop. Its not as fancy looking, however, and the cord is kind of stiff. But if you dont care about that sort of stuff then there is no reason to buy the overpriced apple version."
1,"If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. I have been using it as a tool to get the students to hear professional actors and to then ask them to use the same skills those professional actors use (inflection, emphasis, etc.) The problem is it is VERY difficult to hear...to the point that you have to sit 3 feet away to hear it at times. This simply does not work for a classroom."
1,"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
2,This book is a joy from beginning to end. Funny and insightful. I've recently reread it and found it more enjoyable than the first or second time. Her best work.
2,"Love them. They work well on my long, moderately skinny baby. They are my go-to disposable. I probably won't order them again since we're switching to cloth full time."
2,"I would like to know if the balls can be purchased seperatly? I need to replace some of the balls that have been lost,destroyed,tossed away, or whatever. In a past review there was a recomdation to purchase extra balls, I would like to replace some, can you help me?"
1,"My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake.For years, I have asked English Lit experts what is the genius of Finnegans Wake. No one could give me a straightThe Emperor has no clothes. No one knows why this is great, save for some so called experts who extol this book.I beg of anyone out there, please email me tell me why this is not drivel. You can reach me at alkruse@gmail.com"
2,"I had never even heard of this book. I was in the bookstore looking for The Coldest Winter Ever & it was out of stock (again). So I happened to see No Disrespect by Sr. Souljah & took a chance on reading it. I finished it in 5 days. Excellent reading, it held my attention. I recommended this book to a few of my friends."
1,A lot of people say that these bratz babyz are sooooooooooo cute but I don't think that they are that cute.My cousin Emily just got Bratz big babyz Cloe and she kept telling me and my sister that it was sooooooooooo cute.I think the baby was okay but it wasn't wonderful and she even asked me where the nose was because it was soooooooooo small.A lot of kids say that they are cute but the bratz babyz don't even have real hair and there eyes are huge. I think a lot of people just like them because they are bratz because if MyScene made the same babies that bratz did a lot of kids wouldn't even buy the MyScene babies.So kids need to stop saying there cute because if MyScene made the same babies kids that hate MyScene would say the babies were ugly.
1,"Horrible Keanu Reeves thriller is with out a doubt one of his worse films. Keanu is miscast in this supernatural clunker of a film and the script is almost non existent. The special effects were terrible and most the direction lacks professionalism. I agree with the majority that Rachel Weisz is the movies only saving grace and she's so good that I really felt sorry for her for even being the movie. Her performance makes the movie better than what it really was and that's a miracle in itself considering the fact that the film is almost too bad to watch. Unfortunately, her performance is the only thing that this movie really has to offer and it gets put in the background while the director and Keanu try to rehash the Matrix films into a supernatural thriller that has no qualms in insulting the audience with it's lack of substance and plot.Avoid."
2,"This book was great. I loved the characters, the story line, and all aspects of the book. I have read every book Julie Garwood has written, and she has not disappointed me yet. I look forward to her next book with much anticipation. Her Scottish material makes me want to visit Scotland, and see for myself the green and beauty of the Highlands. Keep writing about this area Ms. Garwood and keep books of this calibor coming to avid readers like myself. I personally Thank You."
1,"I'm not a huge dance/techno/electronica/call-it-what-you-want fan, but I do dabble. And seeing the addition of vocals, bass and guitars to a dance outfit piqued my interest. Unfortunately, it didn't hold it. Nothing really bad here, it just didn't make much impression. ""Drop the Break"" is OK, and I liked the trance-y feel of ""Yallah Habibe"". The only other impression I got was the rather silly lyrics on ""Abduction"". Serviceable for background music, but not really an album I could get into."
2,"I picked up this book for my college class on the study of Native Americans from Civil War to present. Even though this is an educational biography on boarding school life, it is actually quite intriguing. Brenda Child completely covers the topic with very interesting material. I won't say that Boarding School Seasons is one of my favorites, but if you are interested in the topic of Indian boarding schools, then you will actually be suprised at how easy it is for this book to keep your attention. If you are viewing this book for a college course, then your class shouldn't be too hard. This is one of the few college required texts that I actually managed to enjoy"
1,"Typical NBC fashion presentation, covering only a small portion of the games, and predominantly their own athletes. Baffled at the lack of hockey coverage seeing as it was clearly the marquee event of the games. Do not purchase expecting hockey, if one were looking for hockey from the games CTV has a full boxed set of the team canada games. Did have nice coverage however of the opening ceremony which was nice."
1,"I HAVE READ, LISTENED TO AND VIEWED 100'S OF BOOKS, MOVIES ETC. SHADES OF GRAY VIDEO IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE. THE BOOK HOWEVER PROMISES TO BE SUPERIOR READING BY ALL ACCOUNTS, I ENDORSE THE BOOK IN ADVANCE TRUST ME. I AM ABSOLUTELY MIFFED AT THE INFERIOR QUALITY OF THE DVD WHICH ALLEGES TO SERVE AS A PRELUDE IN SOME WAY. I MAY NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN FROM AMAZON BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO. ALL OTHER MATERIAL AND SHIPPING ISSUES HAVE BEEN SUPERIOR. I LOST 10.00 ON THE VIDEO."
1,"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."
1,"Too little of the the major events that I was interested in, and too much of the little events"
1,MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
2,"This book is practical, instructive and easy to read. The author tackles important issues related to safety in these difficult times. There are chapters on traveling domestically and internationally for business and pleasure as well as a chapter on how to protect yourself and your family. It also contains a comprehensive reference section. This book is for anyone who needs to know about terrorist threats and how to respond to those threats."
2,"This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's ""Crashproof"" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression."
2,"This has got to be one of the best films i have been priveleged to see in a long time. The realism is just insane coming from such young actors. they just didn't play the part, they were it. There's moments in this masterpiece that you flat out forget you're watching a screen. a must see for anyone who likes good cinema."
1,"DO NOT BUYIt does the job capturing urine fine,but it does not stop 3-4-month old baby thing feces comming out over the top of a diaper in the backIn our case, every other time our baby boy had bowel movement we had to copmletely change his clothing because of the leakageProduct link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VHSHCA"
2,"I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."
2,"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."
1,"Your money would be better spent on a book that teaches you grammar AND vocabulary. This set comes with no directions, just a bunch of CDs in a box. Using the software isnt explained, the games are useless as you can win just by clicking all over, you dont have to learn anything.Learning phrases isnt helpful for any language if you dont know how to take vocabulary and form your own phrases.Honestly this is a waste of cash. Get a book. If you need pronunciation help buy a book with an audio disc included."
1,Doesn't keep coffee hot enough. Could be used only as a candle warmer. Don't buy it unless you like lukewarm coffee (ugh!).
1,"I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect."
2,"I just bought my first cd in years.Its The Clay Aiken MOAM.Ive been trying to pick A favorite and its impossible.When I listen to one ,I say thats the best,then when the next track has ended I say oh man that has to be the next single.I am glad im not the one that makes the decisions on the next single.I can hear and reconize the words,I can sing along,I get a good feeling.I feel no need to run from the police or to go slap anyone ,to shake my booty,nor to start cussing,so maybe im out of the loop to feel good about what ive heard.I must be so uncool,because i actually feel good and think maybe the world will all get better.I could not say it the way I feel but if i had a month to say it just right I could do a better job.Thank You Clay for making the sun shine brighter today."
2,This was a Christmas memory that I had as a child. We always used to watch it. Still lovely today.
1,"People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this."
1,"This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
1,I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again
1,This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series. I have not seen the new Zatoichi movie yet but this movie gives me great doubts about how good it will be. His other movies may be good but this one is a definite time waster. Save yourselves.
2,"It is a wonderful journey where the author takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere.It may takes you a while to understad I read the book 3 times the first time I had it and so far I read it 8 times in my lifetime and it never stops to excite me.You want to forget your problems, travel to Macondo and learn about making gold and many other things! discover another world."
2,"This is a good printer for the money; however, the print is not as sharp as I would like. Of course, I was used to the old HP LaserJet 4Plus that I had for years with crisp print."
2,"I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. (It is such a great gift in festival's sovenuior such as wedding, X'mas or Halloween.) Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests, especially in darkness environment. If you want to buy Litecubes, you can contact us as follow email address: icubesworkshop@yahoo.com.hk"
1,"These chisels are not sharp out of the box. My skew chisel was chipped and I see from other reviews there have been more than one chipped. As another review said, I cannot sharpen the carbide tips, so I have a new set of chisels that are not as useful as my old ones that I can sharpen. Don't waste your money on these chisels."
1,"Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear! Look elsewhere for your information and make sure to read Ina mAY gASKIN'S GUIDE TO CHILDBIRTH!"
2,"Not factual? How can someone say that! It was written by Linda Lee, Bruce's wife! How can it not be factual? I personally found this book very good. It is an easy read, and it is very informative. This book changed my perception of Bruce. Where I once saw a wonderful martial artist, which I still saw, I now see someone who was of profound mind and good heart. His intentions were great, his mind and philosophies greater, and his legacy shall live on forever. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Now I am sitting on a big box of diapers that don't even fit my daughter anymore. Very disappointing since I thought that this would be a good deal.
2,"Musiq did it again every song on here i like to some sort but my favorite, favorite , is ""Momentinlife"" with kindred and cee-loguiness!!!I recommend this to all the ""real musiq Lovers""I agree with the other person who said that Kindred was overlooked cause that was the truth. They did not get the credit that was due. come on yall lets get the Real Artist to the top cause that is where Real music Lives and is created. They Deserve it! But anyway Musiq Wonderful job it just gets better and better."
1,"Though I've had this only about a month, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Do NOT buy.Other better brands include Unicorn (recommended by a famous cooking magazine), Peugeot, Firth, and William Bounds."
1,"So I've had this product since July 2011, and it is now in the trash. The seams do not hold up and 2 have released, creating giant 'bubbles' in the mattress rendering it unusable. I paid nearly $50 for this back then, and only used it 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item."
2,"Great in-your-face hardcore here. Kind of a mix of old and new school. Two singers, two guitars, and the beats that wont let up. A lot of tempo changes. I WANT MOOOOOOORE!!!! keep the faith brothas."
2,"I haven't been this taken with a book since the Harry Potter series. From the Prelude I was enthralled. Wonderful, strong characters and a storyline that makes putting the book down wrenching."
1,"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."
2,This is a fun little set. There are not alot of pieces in case this is your first Pop-Onz purchase. But they fit inside the green 'mountain' like a carry case that is easy to take along on road trips or to the baby sitters.
2,"I have read many authors on the subject of fly fishing. Dave Hughes is a great writer. He puts it in a language a beginner can understand. I am not a beginner but I really like to read his books. I had several of his books and gave them to our new county library. Then I missed them, so I went on amazon and re-bought several of them. Great service! Would do it again. Tight lines."
1,"I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card. I tried all the right way of trying to cancell it, but it looks like Amazon can get a card ready for shipping within minutes of a purchase, but the delivery date is August 15. I have written you an email, now how long will it take to get a response with Amazon."
2,"I purchased the Cd today, I listen to it 6 times, it is a great cd, I was surprised at his sound and the type of music he chose for the cd... Great selection and mix of music... I believe this will be a hit for him... I like cuts Number 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,and 11. Great going Clay...."
1,"I don't know if this book preceded the other Jamie Oliver book, ""Naked Chef Takes Off,"" but it's the SAME BOOK.I bought this for my wife, thinking I'd found a J.O. book she didn't already own. It's the same, identical book! I suppose it's just the British market title, but don't make the mistake if you're thinking it's a different book.AMAZON STAFF: There should be some mention that this book was released with the different title in the States."
1,"Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL."
2,"DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC."
2,"While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its ""Thriller"" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old ""haunted house"". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park ""fun house"" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind."
2,"I bought this dress in white for my informal shotgun wedding ceremony at City Hall. I am typically a 16/18W and I bought a 2X in this dress.(I have more of an hourglass figure with wider hips and a smaller waist). The dress fits true to size and looks very flattering. Also, I am 5'9 and the dress hits just below my knee. I love the satin finish and matching shawl that comes with it. I do have to get the top tailored slightly because it's too big for my 38C size. Other than that it's perfect for my event!"
1,"Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
1,"Ugh, probably every generation thought it was the greatest. While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over. I think the book needs to be toned down and put in its proper perspective."
1,"For 14 months this product worked great. Then it died. It was not dropped or otherwise abused. TIVO's response was that they would replace it for the cost of buying a new one.Even though it broke so quickly, TIVO is worth the price we payed for the box and the service. If the cable companies could come out with a DVR that was as capable I would rather rent it knowing that if it broke it would be replaced for free.The box itself is rather bulky for the electronics that are actually inside it. The unit could have been designed a little better to make the overall size smaller.Hopefully you get a better box than we did."
2,As someone who likes literature I must say this book is one of the most enjoyable book I've evr read. I analyzed this novel as a realistic one but it's not so gray as most of realistic stories I've read. it has all the emotions 445 pages you can cry be afraid to luagh and to just be happy from reading the book. the main charactor- Francy- She is a wonderfull girl with a lot of imagination and very smart and good I also liked the grandmother - Marry Romely wich is the symbole of the idea that you don't have know reading and writting in order to be smart. she is very good and too smart I know many people who studied in the university but still not as smart as she does.
1,"I bought this DVR because the sales pitch on Amazon said something like, ""No TiVo service required"". That was a lie. The description for this item also never mentioned it was an analog only item.Trying to set up this DVR takes more time than most women giving birth.The manual is useless because it assumes you have a cable or sattelite source.If you want to throw you money away, buy this unit.I just wish there was a DVR for sale that doesn't require cable or sattelite."
1,"Stupid, vapid, anemic remake of the 1975 film. Buy the original instead.This film deserves zero stars."
2,"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed ""Foundation"" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated ""Foundation"" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."
